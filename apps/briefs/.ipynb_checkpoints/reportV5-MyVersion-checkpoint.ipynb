the EU\\'s executive - announced it had decided that the model does not comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and fined Meta €200m (£171m).\"Based on feedback from the EC in connection with the DMA, we expect we will need to make some modifications to our model,\" Meta said in its quarterly earnings statement.Meta said it expected those modifications \"could result in a materially worse user experience for European users and a significant impact\" to its European business and revenue.The company said those impacts could kick in as soon as the third quarter of this year, and may be in effect while it appeals the decision.They would not apply to users in the UK, where Meta has not implemented its ad-free subscription model.It is currently in discussions with the UK\\'s data watchdog, the Information Commissioner\\'s Office (ICO), about a similar model for UK users and what it might look like.A Meta spokesperson told the BBC it was engaging with the ICO to ensure its service satisfies regulatory expectations \"while delivering the UK Government\\'s commitment to ensure that regulators and regulation support growth\".\"Personalised advertising on our platforms drives over £19.5 billion in revenues for UK businesses every year,\" they added.Eric Seufert, analyst at Mobile Dev Memo, said Meta may be trying to strategically turn European users into \"vocal cheerleaders\" for its products amid a regulatory clampdown.\"What they ultimately want to do is turn public opinion against this regulatory regime which will demonstrably degrade the product offerings that are available to EU residents,\" Seufert told the BBC in a phone interview after the announcement.Meta, formerly known as Facebook, includes the social media network in addition to the photo sharing app Instagram and the messaging service WhatsApp.The Commission has said that Meta\\'s consent-or-pay model does not allow users to freely consent to how their data is used.The body is currently assessing another option Meta introduced last year, which the company says uses less personal data to display advertisements.Meta was given 60 days to comply with the DMA\\'s recent decision, or risk further fines.Apple was also issued a €500m (£428m) fine over its App Store practices last week.Meta\\'s announcement comes as it released quarterly earnings that beat Wall Street expectations.The results showed Meta continues to bring in significant advertising revenue.The company touted its AI tools on Wednesday.\"We\\'re making good progress on AI glasses and Meta AI, which now has almost 1 billion monthly actives,\" Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement.\"Our community continues to grow and our business is performing very well,\" he said.Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said the results showed that Meta has gone \"full throttle on investments in AI\". Britzman also noted the 6% jump in daily active users.\"There had been some concerns that we might see a slowdown in new users this year, but this was a very strong start and a signal to investors that Meta\\'s family of apps has a grip on users that\\'s hard to displace,\" Britzman said.The recent rollout of its Meta AI chatbot to users in Europe was met with ire by some WhatsApp users, however.Meta defended the \"optional\" tool that users cannot remove, saying it would listen to user feedback.The EC fine comes amid what Meta called \"an active regulatory landscape\" in its earnings report.The company is currently defending itself at trial in a case brought by the US Federal Trade Commission which alleges that Meta runs a social media monopoly.The FTC, the top antitrust watchdog in the US, says Meta cemented its monopoly by purchasing Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Meta warns of worse EU user experience\\nENTITIES: Meta, European Commission, Digital Markets Act, Mark Zuckerberg, Apple, FTC\\nEVENT: The European Commission fined Meta and said its 'consent or pay' model doesn't comply with the Digital Markets Act, potentially leading to a worse user experience and revenue impact in Europe.

The finding will rewrite the region\\'s geological history and change what researchers thought they knew about some of the U.K.\\'s earliest land life.Researchers initially believed the unnamed meteorite hit Earth 1.17 billion years ago, creating the Stac Fada Member rock layer in northwestern Scotland. However, a new study has determined that the meteorite actually hit 990 million years ago — around 200 million years later than previously thought.The date difference is significant because it changes the geological timeline of the region, which during the days of the strike hosted some of what is now the U.K.\\'s earliest nonmarine life — microscopic freshwater organisms that became the ancestors to plants, animals and fungi, according to a statement released by the University of St Andrews in Scotland.The Stac Fada Member — part of the supercontinent Rodinia 1 billion years ago — preserves what Earth\\'s surface environments were like before and after the impact, study co-author Tony Prave, an emeritus professor of geoscience at the University of St Andrews, told Live Science.\"Those environments (rivers, lakes, estuaries) contained well-established microbial ecosystems,\" Prave said in an email. \"Thus the region provides a natural laboratory to examine what microbial ecosystems and their habitats were like before the impact and, importantly, how they recovered following that dramatic event.\"The researchers published their findings Monday (April 28) in the journal Geology.Related: \\'It was so simple\\': How Antarctica\\'s missing meteorites were discovered using a block of ice, a freezer and a lampGet the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Meteorites are meteoroids — pieces of asteroids or comets — that make it through a planet\\'s atmosphere without burning up and strike the surface. In this case, the strike occurred on Earth during the Precambrian period (4.6 billion to 541 million years ago), when life first evolved and diversified.To better understand the impact date, researchers analyzed the crystals of zircon minerals in the Stac Fada Member. Zircon is highly resistant and can last for billions of years. Additional rings of zircon grow around the mineral\\'s crystal core over time, like the rings in a tree trunk, and in doing so, they can preserve a record of geological events, according to the American Museum of Natural History.Zircon also has tiny amounts of the radioactive element uranium in its crystal structure, which decays over a long period of time and changes into lead, Prave noted. Researchers can measure this decay and use it to date ancient geological events.\\nBillion-year-old impact in Scotland sparks questions about life on land - YouTube\\nWatch On\\n\"The decay of uranium to lead is like a time clock hence, when the meteorite impacted the rocks, it \\'reset\\' the time clock in the zircon crystals,\" Prave said. \"My colleagues then extracted those zircons from the rock and analysed the ratio of lead to uranium within the crystals...\"RELATED STORIESThe results showed that the impact occurred 200 million years later than researchers thought. The new estimate helps researchers better understand Scotland\\'s ancient geology and early freshwater life, but there\\'s still a lot they don\\'t know about the impact, including the size of the meteorite. To estimate that, researchers would need access to the impact crater, but its location is unknown.Prave noted that the environment of Stac Fada returned to normal after the impact, and sediment then slowly buried the impact rocks and associated ancient land surface over the next tens of millions of years. These sediments are now the Torridonian mountains. The crater could be beneath them or under the nearby sea, Prave said. Either way, it likely won\\'t be found anytime soon.\"Basically, we\\'ll have to wait another few tens of millions of years for the Torridonian mountains to be eroded away to see if we can find the impact beneath those or, more likely, the impact occurred in what became (about 950 million years later) the north Atlantic Ocean and hence its location will forever remain unknown,\" Prave said.\\nPatrick Pester is the trending news writer at Live Science.

The report is also limited to children and does not address treatment for adults.Gender-affirming care for transgender youth under standards widely used in the U.S. includes supportive talk therapy and can — but does not always — involve puberty blockers or hormone treatment. Gender-affirming surgeries for transgender minors are rare.A judge has blocked key parts of Trump’s order, which includes denying research and educational grants for medical schools, hospitals and other institutions that provide gender-affirming care to people 18 or younger. Several hospitals around the country ceased providing care. The White House said Monday that since Trump took office, HHS has eliminated 215 grants totaling $477 million for research or education on gender-affirming treatment.Most Republican-controlled states have also adopted bans or restrictions on gender-affirming care. A U.S. Supreme Court ruling is pending after justices heard arguments in December in a case about whether states can enforce such laws.The Jan. 28 executive order is among several administration policies aimed at denying the existence of transgender people. Trump also has ordered the government to identify people as either male or female rather than accept a concept of gender in which people fall along a spectrum, remove transgender service members from the military, and bar transgender women and girls from sports competitions that align with their gender. This month, HHS issued guidance to protect whistleblowers who report doctors or hospitals providing gender-affirming care. Judges are blocking enforcement of several of the policies.This latest HHS report, which Trump called for while campaigning last year, represents a reversal in federal policy. The U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which is part of HHS, found that no research had determined that behavioral health interventions could change someone’s gender identity or sexual orientation. The 2023 update to the 2015 finding is no longer on the agency’s website. The administration says this new report will go through a peer-review process. In the meantime, it’s not saying who contributed to it, “in order to help maintain the integrity of this process.”The report says that medical groups have relied on medical treatment rather than behavioral therapy for transgender youth partly because of a “mischaracterization of such approaches as ‘conversion therapy,’” which about half the states have banned for minors.The American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry has said that evidence shows conversion therapies inflict harm on young people, including elevated rates of suicidal ideation. And the American Medical Association has urged states not to ban gender-affirming care for minors, saying that “empirical evidence has demonstrated that trans and non-binary gender identities are normal variations of human identity and expression.”', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Trump admin urges therapy for transgender youth\\nENTITIES: Donald Trump, Health and Human Services, World Professional Association for Transgender Health, National Institutes of Health, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya\\nEVENT: The Trump administration released a report advocating for behavioral therapy over gender-affirming care for transgender youth, questioning existing standards and potentially shifting federal policy.\\nCONTEXT: This represents a reversal in federal policy regarding transgender healthcare.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-02T16:09:34.237Z'}, {'id': 45244, 'sourceId': 12762, 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/01/wechat-ad-distances-bennelong-candidate-scott-yung-from-liberal-party-federal-election-ntwnfb', 'title': 'Bennelong candidate appears to distance himself from Liberal party with Chinese-language ad', 'publishDate': '2025-05-01T08:02:14.000Z', 'content': 'The Liberal candidate for Bennelong, Scott Yung, appears to be distancing himself from the party as a paid ad tells the Chinese-Australian diaspora that he does not “blindly follow” instructions, highlighting his previous criticism of Scott Morrison.A Chinese language ad, launched on the Australian Financial News WeChat page on Thursday morning, carried the headline “He once publicly criticised his party leader” and highlighted Yung’s “independent thinking”.The ad, launched at 6am, coincided with reports in the Australian Financial Review that Yung had allegedly told voters at polling stations that “the leader’s not going to be there forever”. Yung told the outlet that the report was “a lazy smear attempt” and that he “strongly supports” Peter Dutton.Dutton later batted off the reports, saying Yung had “denied those rumours”.The WeChat ad – narrow-cast to Chinese-Australians, who are likely to play an influential role at Saturday’s election – was authorised by Warren Wang, who appears to be a member of Yung’s team and has authorised other material promoting his campaign.\\nSign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter\\nGuardian Australia contacted Yung’s campaign to confirm whether they authorised the ad, as well as the Coalition’s campaign team.“I am a proud long-term member of the Liberal Party, running as part of Peter Dutton’s team to deliver a Liberal Government,” Yung responded.The ad did not mention Dutton, but it highlighted previous criticism by Yung of the party’s treatment of the Chinese diaspora, and described him as someone who would not blindly follow orders.“Although Scott is a member of the Liberals, he doesn’t blindly follow,” said the ad. “Instead he has independent thinking and he will serve the country based on national interest.“For instance, when Liberals lost the 2022 federal election and lost the 2022 NSW state election, Scott, based on facts with a comprehensive view, wrote to the Sydney Morning Herald to criticise former PM Scott Morrison for causing damage to the Chinese Australian community.”A 2022 review of the Liberal party’s election defeat raised serious concerns about how the party was engaging with the community and the impact of the Morrison government’s hawkish approach to China.Almost one-third of residents in Bennelong have Chinese ancestry. The Labor member, Jerome Laxale, holds the seat with a margin of just 0.1%.In recent days, several media outlets alleged volunteers for the independent MP Monique Ryan were directed to vote for her by an organisation with reported historical links to a Chinese foreign influence unit. The group was also linked to Labor frontbencher Clare O’Neil’s campaign.Ryan and O’Neil denied any wrongdoing but the matter was being considered by the “electoral integrity assurance taskforce”, which is run by the electoral commision, the federal police and the domestic intelligence agency.The allegations drew strong criticism from Liberal frontbenchers, including Jane Hume, who suggested “Chinese spies” may have been handing out how to vote cards for O’Neil.But the criticism from Liberal frontbenchers was not well received by some members of the Chinese-Australian community on WeChat who believed it was unfair and called for a boycott of Liberal candidates in Victoria.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionIn response to Hume’s comments, one WeChat user said: “How could the Liberals say things like this? Everyone should put the Liberals last on the green ballot.” The green ballot refers to the House of Representatives voting card.On Thursday afternoon, the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, also referenced Hume’s comments in a one-minute video uploaded to WeChat, in which she briefly spoke in Mandarin.The most memorable moments of the 2025 Australian federal election, in two minutes – video“Liberal senator Jane Hume accused Chinese-Australians volunteering in the federal election of being Chinese spies,” Wong said in the video. “We’ve seen this before from the Liberal party. Why is it that the Liberal party continues to question the loyalty of Chinese Australians?”The Liberal party’s review of the 2022 election found that in the top 15 seats by Chinese ancestry, the two-party preferred swing against them was 6.6% compared with 3.7% in other seats.The Thursday WeChat ad acknowledged the Liberal party’s relationship with the Chinese-Australian diaspora had been strained and positioned Yung as someone who could repair it.“Scott understands the difficulties and needs of Chinese-Australians and feels lucky that he grew up in multicultural Australia,” the campaign ad said.“As he continues to contribute to the prosperity and development of Australia, he also wants to make some contribution to bridge the Chinese-Australian community and the Australian community and make Chinese-Australian voices heard.”Elsewhere, Yung has faced sustained questioning about his campaign spending during the 2019 state election related to free endorsements from Chinese celebrities and free work provided by a PR agency. Yung has said this work did not need to be disclosed in campaign expenditure reports as it was voluntarily provided for free.When Dutton campaigned in Bennelong earlier this week, Yung faced questions from the travelling press pack and again repeated his assurance that his disclosures were compliant with the law.', 'location': 'AUS', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Bennelong candidate distances from Liberal party\\nENTITIES: Scott Yung, Liberal Party, Peter Dutton, Scott Morrison, Chinese-Australian community, Penny Wong, Jane Hume\\nEVENT: Liberal candidate Scott Yung's Chinese-language ad highlights his independence from the party, referencing past criticism of Morrison, while Penny Wong criticizes Liberal frontbenchers for questioning the loyalty of Chinese-Australian volunteers.\\nCONTEXT: The ad highlights Yung's independent thinking and past criticism of Scott Morrison, appealing to Chinese-Australian voters.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-02T16:09:34.237Z'}, {'id': 42088, 'sourceId': 12485, 'url': 'https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/best-phone/#ftag=CAD4aa2096', 'title': 'Best Phone to Buy for 2025', 'publishDate': '2025-05-01T01:12:00.000Z', 'content': \"Out of all the smartphones that CNET tests each year but only a handful are worthy of being called the best phones.

It comes in two sizes: a 6.1-inch regular iPhone 16 model or a larger 6.7-inch iPhone 16 Plus model that starts at $899. The phones have a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera that performs better in low light and can now take macro photos, meaning you'll be able to focus close to take amazing food snaps. The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus have a handful of Apple Intelligence tools for writing, removing distractions from photos and doing summaries of messages and webpages. There's also adds a ChatGPT integration to Siri.The phones also have an Action button that can be programed for different functions like turning on the flashlight, recording a voice memo, changing the focus mode and more. There's also a new Camera Control button that not only lets you take photos and quickly change things like zoom, Portrait mode aperture and Photographic Styles, but can also trigger a new feature called Visual Intelligence, which will add context to whatever the camera is pointed at, a bit like Google Lens. We think the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are ideal for most people looking for a great phone that will last for years.Best phones of 2025 Pros\\nCamera Control is useful for switching camera settings\\nPhotographic Styles makes photos pop\\nUltrawide camera is better in low light\\nCons\\nApple Intelligence isn’t out yet\\nNo always on display\\nNo changes to wired charging speeds\\nNo upgrades to the Action button\\nWhen I tested the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus I was definitely impressed by the new photography features, the convenient Action button and the elegant build. I consider these phones to be top-notch choices for Apple fans. Parts of the iPhone 16’s key feature, Apple Intelligence, are now out, and the fact that these phones will support it means they’ll likely feel future-proofed for years to come. Aside from screen size (6.1 inches on the regular, 6.7 inches on the Plus), battery size and price, the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are identical in every way.The iPhone 16 isn’t perfect -- it’s missing an always-on display, and it feels like it’s been ages since Apple improved its wired charging speeds. But it checks all the important boxes and then some.Why we like itThe iPhone 16 and 16 Plus rank so high in our testing because the phones appeal to both novice users and power players a like. They offer about 90% of the experience of Apple's Pro models but cost hundreds of dollars less. Not only is the iPhone 16 a wonderful phone out of the box, Apple has a long track record of updating its software and security patches for years.Who it's best forWhen you think about how the Camera Control key, the Action button and the Dynamic Island come together, along with the camera and battery improvements Apple has made over the last several years, the iPhone 16 is a compelling upgrade for someone coming from an older iPhone, especially if that person is on an iPhone 13 or older. For those who don’t need the Pro’s extra photography prowess and battery life, the iPhone 16 won’t disappoint. Who shouldn’t get itI wouldn't recommend buying the iPhone 16 just for the Camera Control button or the better ultrawide camera. Add to compare Pros\\nCamera consistently delivers good images\\nImpressive battery life\\nMore AI features feel practical\\nCons\\nSeveral gimmicky AI features\\nNot many changes over the S24\\nThe Galaxy S25's biggest flex that I noticed while testing is it shares many of the same attributes as its pricier counterparts, the S25 Plus and S25 Ultra – but it does so for several hundred dollars less. You'll find features like the AI Select tool, Audio Eraser and deeper Gemini integration across all of Samsung's S25 devices, as well as a custom Snapdragon 8 Elite processor and 12GB RAM – making the smaller phone of the bunch still seem pretty mighty.\\xa0And while the Galaxy S25 might look incredibly similar to the S24 and share many of the same specs, consistency isn't so bad when it means there's a consistently good camera and great battery life. Read our full Samsung Galaxy S25 review.Why we like itHaving a baseline phone, like the Galaxy S25, that delivers many of the same perks as more expensive models, is a huge plus in my book. And given the remarkable processing power, standout camera and seamless AI integration in the Galaxy S25 lineup, it's great that I can get all those premium features for $800. Who it's best forIf you're someone who insists on buying a flagship device, the Galaxy S25 won't let you down. but if you have a device that's two years old or more, you might be enticed to tap into all the latest Galaxy AI and integrated Gemini features. Now, $800 isn't pocket change, and there are definitely other options for those who want to be more budget conscious, but if you're willing to spend a bit more, the baseline S25 can be a great all-around choice.Who shouldn’t get itYou probably don't need to upgrade if you're using last year's S24. Add to compare Pros\\nCover screen updates\\nGood battery life\\nFun, fashionable design\\nCamera upgrades a step forward, but could go farther\\nCons\\nNew cameras are a mixed bag\\nCamera cover screen position not great for right handed-people\\nGets warm gaming or charging\\nEditor's note: Motorola announced its 2025 lineup which includes the Razr Ultra and a 2025 version of the Motorola Razr Plus. The new Razr Plus is virtually identical to the 2024 model, aside from a new titanium hinge and added dust resistance.When I consider the Motorola Razr Plus on its own terms, it is outstanding. And perhaps, more importantly, it's a delight to use. The 4-inch cover screen makes the Razr feel like two phones in one. You can use pretty much any app on the outer display as well as respond to messages, watch videos, make video calls and even play games – all without opening the Razr Plus up.Add to that a long battery life (a day plus more in my testing), fast charging, improved cameras and an IPX8 rating that certifies that the Razr Plus will survive temporary dunking and you realize just how much value Motorola has poured into its flagship foldable. It's $1,000 price is steep, but you're getting one of the best clamshell style foldable phones you can buy. Read our full Motorola Razr Plus review.Why we like itNot only does the Motorola Razr Plus (2024) have one of the best values as a foldable phone, it's one of the funnest phones I've ever tested. There genuinely isn't another phone that offers the experience that Motorola carved out here with the Razr Plus (2024).Who's it best forThe Razr Plus (2024) is for people who want to express themselves and have a phone that stand outs from the crowd of rectangular slabs. It's for someone who embraces new technology like a folding screen and wants a bit of nostalgia. At $1,000, it still costs a lot. But you can often find the Razr Plus (2024) discounted.Who shouldn't get itIf you're looking for a budget phone, but really want a flip phone, check out the regular Razr. If you're nervous about own a foldable phone, I'd recommend staying away from the Razr Plus. Add to compare Pros\\nLarger screens/thinner bezels\\n4K slo-mo OMG\\nAudio Mix is brilliant\\niOS 18\\nCons\\nNo Apple Intelligence out of the box\\nCamera Control placement not optimal for one-handed shooting\\nElegant finishes aren't very colorful\\nOnly 128GB of storage for $1,000\\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max have everything I've come to expect in a year-over-year upgrade. The 6.3-inch iPhone 16 Pro and 6.9-inch iPhone 16 Pro Max have a slew of upgrades including one of the best batteries on any phone I've tested as well as. In our testing it will easily last a day on a single charge.The phones also have larger displays, outstanding photo and video chops, high-resolution slo-mo, a new Camera Control button, iOS 18 goodies and a handful of Apple Intelligence tools. The negatives are as thin as the borders around the new screens: You only get 128GB of storage for $1,000; there are only drab color options, and a the new camera button is easy to tap accidentally. Read our full iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max review.Why we like itThis year the 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max have the exact same cameras -- unlike the 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max, which had different telephoto options. Screen size, battery life and price should be the deciding factors when you're choosing between the two. The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max are excellent phones worthy of a spot in your pocket (and mine) if you can afford them.Who it's best forIf you have an iPhone 12 Pro or older, upgrading to the 16 Pro makes a lot of sense. If you're on a 13 Pro and still have a decent battery capacity, I'd say save your money. And if you're on a 14 Pro or 15 Pro, there's no need to upgrade. Also, I should note that the entry-level $999 iPhone 16 Pro only has 128GB of storage.Who shouldn't get itIf you are looking for a budget phone or don't need a phone with the latest features or tech. Add to compare Pros\\nBest screen on any phone\\nVersatile cameras\\nMost powerful phone I've tested\\nGood battery life\\nCons\\n$1,300 price\\nDesign is almost too minimal\\nAI features are hit-or-miss\\nS25/S25 Plus have similar features and cost less\\nSamsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra which has a lot of AI features, the best of which are interesting and the worst of which unreliable. Luckily, Samsung gets a lot of other things right on the S25 Ultra, which has a new Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, high-resolution ultrawide camera, and some sweet pro video tools that rival the iPhone 16 Pro. Samsung wisely kept all the best parts of last year's Galaxy S24 Ultra (basically the entire phone including that antireflective display) but some of its worst parts, too, like the $1,300 price tag.If you want the best screen you can find on any phone, get the S25 Ultra. If you want the most versatile phone cameras, get the S25 Ultra. If you want a stylus, get the S25 Ultra. But if your needs scale back on any of those fronts, the more affordable S25 options, or even last year's S24 Ultra, may be worth considering. Read our full Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review.Why we like itThe reason to get the Ultra over its S25 siblings is its screen, which is truly the best I've seen on any phone, and the cameras, which are a step above what the S25 and S25 Plus have. Added video features like ability to record in Log format gets the Ultra as close as it's ever been to the iPhone in terms of professional video capture.Who it's best forIf you have a Galaxy S22 Ultra or older, the S25 Ultra will seem like a significant upgrade. It's harder to make that case for S23 Ultra owners, who, unless their phone's battery is ailing or they can score an incredible discount, should otherwise sit this one out. And for you S24 Ultra owners, you don't need this phone. Save your money and treat yourself to a nice steak dinner and a movie.Who shouldn’t get itThe Galaxy S25 Ultra's appeal is muddied by its $1,300 price. The regular Galaxy S25 has the same functionality, power and longevity, and it costs $500 less. Want a bigger screen? Consider the Galaxy S25 Plus. For the majority of people, the regular Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus will be a better fit. Get it now Add to compare Pros\\nUSB-C port is more convenient charging\\nColorful matte design\\nImproved camera that can automatically take people and pet portraits\\nDynamic Island brings better multitasking\\nCons\\nNo always-on display\\nFind My Friends feature only works with other iPhone 15 phones\\nDiscounted iPhone 14 Pro may be a better value\\nGalaxy S24 offers a longer optical zoom\\nWith the launch of the iPhone 16, the regular iPhone 15 is being sold at a discount -- $100 off. That means that the iPhone 15 now starts at $699. And you might be able to find steeper discounts throughout the coming weeks and months. With the Dynamic Island, a USB-C port for more convenient charging and a high resolution camera and a sharper digital zoom, I found the iPhone 15 to be a significant upgrade for those with older iPhones.The iPhone 15 is available in two size options: the 6.1-inch iPhone 15 and the 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Plus. They run on the same chip as iPhone 14 Pro, the A16 Bionic, which should bring notable performance upgrades to those with an iPhone that's several years old. These phones also have Apple's second-generation ultra wideband chip, enabling a new feature that makes it easier to find friends or family members in a crowd which I found handy. Read our full iPhone 15 review.Why we like itThe iPhone 15 and 15 Plus are heavily influenced by the iPhone 14 Pro. That includes the Dynamic Island, a dedicated area near the top of the screen for viewing time-sensitive data like your Uber's ETA, and the A16 Bionic processor. Overall, these changes come together to make the iPhone 15 feel like a big step forward for those upgrading from an aging iPhone. Who it's best forThe iPhone 15 is for someone coming from an iPhone 12 or older. In 2025, Apple sells it for $699. But I recommend looking for one that's discounted. If you're contemplating the iPhone 16E but really want an ultrawide camera (remember the 16E only has a single rear camera) and MagSafe charging, then grab an iPhone 15.Who shouldn't get itApple sells the $599 iPhone 16E which makes the iPhone 15 a curious value. If you can score a discounted iPhone 15 I'd go that way. But otherwise, the iPhone 16E might be a better buy. Add to compare Pros\\nGenuinely fun new AI skills\\nSleek new design\\nSeven years of software updates\\nCameras can take great daytime shots\\nCons\\nCamera hardware hasn't improved much over Pixel 8 Pro\\nGemini AI will eventually require a paid subscription\\nThe Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL have a lot going for them, from their shiny new designs and long software support period. But it's the AI skills that really stand out, from the deep integration of the conversational Gemini Live, to the new Pixel Studio that creates weird and wonderful images from your text prompts.The phones aren't perfect. While the cameras are good and can take excellent photos in bright light, they're just okay in low-light and in night mode. The best AI features will require a monthly subscription (though you get the first year for free) But if you're keen to experiment with AI on your phone then the new Pixel 9 Pro range is a superb way to experience it. Read our Google Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL review.Why we like itGoogle's Pixel line of phones has gone from strength to strength and its latest model is unquestionably the best phone the company has ever made. It's not just the slick-looking design; the Pixel 9 Pro offers a superb camera system, a generous support period and a host of new AI skills making it one of the most accomplished Android phones around. The 9 Pro XL takes that further by accommodating a bright and vibrant 6.8-inch display.Who it's best forIt's a great phone for those of you looking for an elegant everyday Android phone. The interface is easy to navigate and the camera takes great photos with almost no effort on your part. If you feel overwhelmed by the plethora of settings and menus on other Android flagships, Google's Pixel 9 Pro is the way to go. If playing mobile games or watching videos on the go is a priority, opt for the larger Pixel 9 Pro XL.Who shouldn't get itIf you don't need the best cameras Google makes, consider the regular Pixel 9. I do like the fit and finish better on the 9 Pro, but it starts at $999. Add to compare Pros\\nLightning fast charging\\nNice big screen\\n7 years of OS and security upgrades\\nGreat performance with games, movies and animations\\nCons\\nBattery life is a day, similar to baseline S25\\nSimilar specs as the S25 at a higher price\\nRival phones at the same price have better cameras\\nIf the baseline Galaxy S25 appeals to you but you'd rather have a bigger screen and higher battery capacity – without upgrading all the way to the Ultra – the S25 Plus may be the phone for you. The entire S25 lineup shares many features, from AI capabilities to processing power to memory, so the Plus may be a viable choice if you're looking for something right in the middle.That said, the Plus' minimal upgrades over the baseline S25 may not justify the $200 price difference. But if a bigger phone just feels better to hold and you'd rather have a 4,900 mAh battery (over the S25's 4,000mAh one), then that $1,000 starting price might ultimately be worth every penny. Read CNET's full Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus review.Why we like itWhile the baseline S25 checks all the key boxes, the S25 Plus can simply feel like a more comfortable device to use, especially if you're a fellow member of the bigger hands club. In addition to sharing many of the same features as the pricier S25 Ultra, the S25 Plus has a higher battery capacity than the baseline model -- though in CNET's tests, there weren't any major discrepancies in how the two batteries actually performed. Still, sometimes you just want to live a little larger, and this phone can be the perfect fit.Who it's best forIf you like having a larger screen to watch movies or play games on, the S25 Plus can be a great choice. While the S25 Ultra might be a top pick for someone who wants both a bigger phone and the most premium features, the S25 Plus can be that goldilocks device that meets you right in the middle -- without you having to spend $1,300 on the Ultra.Who shouldn’t get itIf you want the absolute best in terms of cameras, don't get the S25 Plus. For $1,000 phones like the Pixel 9 Pro or iPhone 16 Pro have better cameras. Or if you can afford to buy a $1,300 phone, check out the Galaxy S25 Ultra which has an amazing set of lenses Add to compare Pros\\nBeautiful design that feels durable\\nFun and somewhat useful AI features\\nNew ultrawide camera takes good photos\\n7 years of software updates for longevity\\nCons\\nMore expensive that previous Pixels and competitors\\nDoesn't feel that different from Pixel 8\\nThere’s a lot to like about the Pixel 9, from its respectable camera to its classy new design and lengthy 7-year timeline for software updates. But Google’s phones have always shined for their clean, slick software, and that once again applies to the Pixel 9 series. Pixels are also among the first to get new software updates, making them an ideal choice for those who want to get their hands on the latest version of Android first. Aside from Android updates, Google also brings new features to Pixel phones throughout the year through updates it calls Feature Drops.The Pixel 9 comes with a few new AI tricks that you may find useful, like the ability to search for content in screenshots, generate images from scratch in the Pixel Studio app and add new objects in photos. These features aren’t must-haves, and they’re not without flaws. Plus, at a starting price of $799, the Pixel 9 has a higher bar to live up to. But the Pixel 9 feels like it belongs in that class of device. Read our full review for the Google Pixel 9.Why we like itThe Pixel 9 and Google's Gemini assistant still feel like a first step toward what the company is hoping to achieve: Making phone software more intelligent so that we can spend less time swiping, tapping, scrolling and digging. In the meantime, the Pixel 9 shines for its great camera, elegant design and clean software, just like the less AI-centric Pixels of years past.Who it's best forIf you're a Pixel fan upgrading from an older phone, like the Pixel 6 or earlier, you'll find a lot to love about the Pixel 9. But keep in mind that for the same price, Samsung's Galaxy S25 has a brighter screen and a dedicated telephoto lens for taking zoomed photos.Who shouldn't get itIf you want the absolute best cameras that Google makes, including having a dedicated telephoto lens, I'd recommend the Pixel 9 Pro. Add to compare Pros\\nMatte finish\\nNew main camera take good photos\\n7 years of OS updates\\nAuto zoom for photos\\nCons\\n$1,100 starting price is high\\nCover screen is a step down in quality from the internal one\\nAdding apps to cover screen is wonky\\nFor better or worse, Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 6 foldable is packed with AI. It can take a rough sketch and turn it into artwork or help me have a conversation in French or Korean despite me only knowing a few words of either language. The new autofocus/auto zoom feature lets you prop the phone in a half-open position, the Z Flip 6 will automatically zoom in or out (switching between the main and ultrawide cameras) to get a photo that best suits the moment. But the AI features are the least impressive aspects of the the Z Flip 6.Samsung's latest clamshell style foldable has a new 50-megapixel main camera, a smaller hinge and crease, a larger battery and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. But all this comes at a higher starting price: $1,099 which makes it hard to appreciate the Galaxy Z Flip 6 for the absolute great phone that it is. Read our full review for the Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 6.Why we like itSamsung's latest clamshell style foldable has a new 50-megapixel main camera, finally putting it on par with non-folding flagship phone cameras. The hinge is smaller and helps reduce the size of the crease on the internal screen. It has a new chip, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and 12GB of RAM for flagship performance. There's even a larger battery. For all intents and purposes, the new Z Flip 6 is a Galaxy S24 that can fold in half – which is fantastic.Who it's best forIf you already have a Samsung phone and have been itching to try a flip phone, then then the Galaxy Z Flip 6 brings the software and features you're used to in a cutting-edge design that is equally nostalgic and seemingly futuristic.Who shouldn’t get itIf you spend a ton of time around dirt or sand, this phone isn't for you.

The new phones replace last year's Galaxy S24 series and come with new processors and cameras -- all at the same price.Pick the most important feature: Is it screen size? Camera quality? Battery life? This will help narrow down your choices. Phones like the iPhone 16 Pro Max or Galaxy S24 Ultra cost well over $1,000, for example, but pack large batteries that will last most people a day and a half to two days on a single charge.Don't dismiss $500 to $800 phones:\\xa0You can get a great phone that does almost everything that a more expensive flagship model can do for a fraction of the price. Google's Pixel 9 (which starts at $799) packs a great camera, a bright screen and unique AI features, but the $499 Pixel 8A has most of the same key specs and comes at a lower price.Shop Cyber Monday: Look for sales and deals close to holidays, especially Amazon's Prime Day and Cyber Monday.Consider last year's models: When a new phone gets launched, stores and carriers discount their older phones to sell off existing stock.See the phone in person:\\xa0It's worth going to a store and trying out a potential phone. You may love or hate the way it looks and feels.Decide on Android or iPhone: Do you have a lot of iPhone apps and Apple subscriptions? Stick with an iPhone. If you've invested in loads of Android apps, you may want to stay on that side of the fence. Otherwise, it's simple enough to switch platforms.Budget for a case and screen protector:\\xa0Phones sold today are more durable than phones from even a few years ago, but it still might be a good idea to protect your phone with a case to keep it in tip-top shape.\\nShow more\\nWe test every phone in real-world scenarios, focusing on its features, design, performance, cameras, battery life and overall value. We document our findings in an initial review that is periodically updated when there are new software updates, or to compare it against new phones from competitors such as Apple, Samsung, Google and OnePlus. Emergency SOS debuted on the iPhone 14 series and we got to test the feature out to see how it works. Kevin Heinz/CNETPhotographyPhotography is a major focus for most phones these days, so we take pictures and videos of various subjects in a variety of settings and lighting scenarios. We try out any new camera modes, such as 4K slow motion video that debuted with the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max, or the new Magic Editor photo tools that launched with the Google Pixel 9 series.Battery lifeBattery testing is conducted in a variety of ways. We assess how long a phone lasts during a typical day of use and note how it performs during more focused sessions of video calls, media streaming and gaming. We also conduct a video playback test, as a simple, replicable measure of pure battery life, which isn't always included in the initial review but sometimes added later in an update. Tharon Green/CNETWe use benchmarking apps to measure each phone's performance, alongside our own anecdotal experiences using the phone for our review. Most noteworthy is how graphics and animations look. Are they smooth? Do they lag or stutter? We also look at how quickly the phone switches between horizontal and vertical orientations, and how fast the camera app opens and is ready to take a photo. We also test every phone we review for the basics like making a phone call. Kevin Heinz/CNETWe perform processor-heavy tasks like editing photos, exporting videos and playing games. We evaluate whether a newer version of a particular phone includes enough features to make it worth upgrading from older models.Performance measuringRead\\xa0more:\\xa0How We Test Phones While Apple doesn't sell the iPhone 15 Pro, you can still find it at carriers and third-party retailers. The 15 Pro has a 6.1-inch adaptive-refresh rate screen that adjusts between 1-120Hz depending on what's on the screen. It has excellent cameras, a fast processor, an always-on display, supports iOS 18 and safety features like Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via Satellite. Driving all these upgrades is Apple's A17 Pro chip which in use feels peppy.\\xa0The iPhone 15 Pro is still an excellent phone in 2025. Check out our iPhone 15 Pro review. What is the best time to buy a phone? Typically the best time to buy a phone is just after it's been announced. Some companies offer really great deals for pre-orders and bundle the phone with accessories at no extra cost. Phone makers usually offer high trade-in values for the first month on old phones that can bring a new phone's price down by hundreds of dollars--if not cover the cost entirely.\\nShow more\\nHow long should a phone battery last? Most smartphones -- even those at the top end -- should be able to deliver a full day of mixed use out of a single charge. That means you should have a bit of juice left at the end of your day, but you should expect to give it a full charge when you plug it in next to your bed at night.\\nShow more\\nHow much storage should I get on a phone? Most phones tend to come with a minimum of 128GB of storage, which is a decent amount for apps, games and locally stored music. But as phones can take higher-resolution photos and videos it's important to think about what your phone's storage might look like in two or three years. It's also important to think about what you'll be doing with your phone: If you want to download and play a lot of games, then consider opting for a higher-capacity version. So if you can afford to get a phone with 256GB of storage, your future self will thank you.\\nShow more\\nWhat are the best phone brands currently? In 2025, some of the best phone makers include Apple, Samsung, Xiaomi, Google, Motorola, Nothing and OnePlus.\\nShow more\\nSamsung teased the Galaxy S25 Edge at its January Galaxy Unpacked event.

It was introduced back in 2023 and I\\'ve been using one ever since – I absolutely love it!If, like me, the mother figure in your life loves mocktails and cocktails, I think it\\'s a perfect Mother\\'s Day gift, especially since it\\'s now available at its lowest price yet on Amazon – just AU$196 for two of the colour options (down from an RRP of AU$299).Why do I like it so much? Well, because it looks absolutely lovely on my home bar and I\\'ve been able to carbonate a wide variety of drinks, from water, juice, flat Coke, cocktails and even homemade iced tea.In my Breville InFizz Fusion review, I said that it was a \"game changer\" because it does more than make soda water. I\\'d used a SodaStream before and was enjoying getting creative by purchasing flavourings, but this Breville alternative is so much more versatile and, thanks to this discount, is now cheaper than any of SodaStream\\'s newer models.Sure, I still buy flavourings, but I\\'ve also been fizzing everything from store-bought and fresh juices, as well as cordial drinks.I\\'ve made cocktails like Long Island Iced Tea by fizzing up cola-flavoured soda for it in the InFizz Fusion rather than buying Coke. I\\'ve carbonated white wine, rosé and some chilled red wines that are great for summer.I grew up with a drink powder called Tang and I\\'ve carbonated the orange-flavoured one as well as the lemon-pepper version, and they\\'re both delicious with a little bit of fizz.Heck, I\\'ve even carbonated coconut water... something I wouldn\\'t really recommend you do. Fizzing store-bought orange juice is also not that great, IMHO. Apple juice, though, ain\\'t all that bad with a touch of CO2.(Image credit: Sharmishta Sarkar / TechRadar)Long story short, the Breville InFizz Fusion is versatile and its FusionCap keeps the fizz inside for days. I\\'ve been able to store sparkling water in the fridge in the provided bottle for over a week without any change in bubbling, and have had similar success with re-carbonated Coke too.It\\'s versatility is complimented by its good looks. Its carbonation lever reminds me of a kitchen or bathroom sink tap, but the whole aesthetic is open, sleek and modern. It would look good on any kitchen countertop or home bar.The machine ships with a 1L plastic bottle, but you can purchase extras if you want – I would recommend picking up the 2-pack of the 600ml bottles for AU$39 as it gives you the freedom to store smaller quantities and refizz them if needed without worrying too much about reaching the Minimum mark for aeration. You can also get a 2-pack of the 1L bottles for AU$49 if you prefer.In the box is also a long-handled bottle brush that\\'s useful for cleaning, as well as a sieve and a funnel, both of which I didn\\'t think I\\'d need but have actually ended up using a few times.The InFizz Fusion uses the same 60L screw-type gas canister as SodaStreams, so they\\'re easy to exchange at many petrol stations around the country.If mum enjoys hosting or loves a cold drink, the Breville InFizz Fusion is a worthwhile investment for the whole family and a very thoughtful gift in my opinion, particularly when there\\'s a whopping 34% discount up for grabs.You might also like...Check out more thoughtful Mother\\'s Day gift ideasBreville also makes some of the best coffee machines in AustraliaIn our Breville Paradice 16 review, we thought it was the best food processor yet\\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\\nWhile she\\'s happiest with a camera in her hand, Sharmishta\\'s main priority is being TechRadar\\'s APAC Managing Editor, looking after the day-to-day functioning of the Australian, New Zealand and Singapore editions of the site, steering everything from news and reviews to ecommerce content like deals and coupon codes.

His debut is scheduled for May 6th, barely enough time for EA’s ink to dry on their mass laying-off of the people that made him (fifth most played game on Steam, y’know, maybe tells you something). He’s Space-Italian, has a folding bow on his arm, and - fittingly for how I feel about this game right now - is a massive bastard.\\nWatch on YouTube\\nNot personality-wise, you understand. He’s an upbeat chap despite his Apex-character-standard family issues, and he loves his pet cat, bless them both. As a fighter, though? Nightmare. Even with an archer motif that slots neatly into Season 25’s renewed focus on long-range shootouts, the sheer versatility of Sparrow’s ability loadout – which spans enemy tracking, AoE damage, and one hell of a mobility aid – make his all-around lethality honestly kind of worrying. I think I\\'ll like playing as him. I know I won’t like playing against him.\\nAs a Recon legend, Sparrow’s day job is to flick out tracking darts that embed in walls or floors and – after a brief delay – feed his team the positions of any opponents caught in its radius. While the fact that each dart needs line-of-sight to track a target means they aren’t as individually powerful as, say, Bloodhound’s omniscient tactical scan, they still highlight foes that Sparrow and his pals can’t see themselves, which is more than enough of an advantage to mount a successful push. They work defensively, too: if I ever wanted to set up a sniping perch in the latter stages of a match, where ambushes are most common, I’d usually drop a dart behind me as an early-warning proximity alarm.\\nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun/EA\\nThis wouldn’t spoil my chance to throw out offensive darts either, as they come with multiple, rapidly refilling charges, with the option to add more via skill tree upgrades. Enemies that are quick enough on the draw can shoot down darts before they activate, but with multiple charges, I found it easy to just carpet-dart entrenched players to the point where they’d either be tracked or in need of a reload by the time I’d moved in on top of them. Either way, they’d be filled with more holes than freshly baked focaccia.\\nSuch aggression is further encouraged by Sparrow’s passive, a double jump straight out of Titanfall. No, you\\'re crying. It\\'s better, even, as leaps can be chained together with a single-charge wall jump to quickly scamper up buildings or throw off an attacker’s aim in close quarters. It’s an accessible, enjoyably bouncy movement tool, though that makes it all the more surprising to see on a Recon character. With the exception of Season 14’s Vantage, this lot are typically built around possessing powerful intel-gathering abilities, of the kind that can grant game-winning impetus in a fight – but at the expense of lacking ways to evade and escape if the other team survives the vision disadvantage and confronts them.\\nSparrow? He can do it all. Especially when throwing out his ultimate, Stinger Bolt, which repeatedly (and painfully) shocks and slows enemies in its generous area of effect. That’s plenty of indirect damage-dealing added to his bulging toolkit, then, and like the tracker darts, it’s equally ruinous whether you’re dropping it at your feet to reclaim the edge in an up-close brawl or twanging it into a distant squad from range.\\nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun/EA\\nIts precision-firing capability also makes Stinger Bolt stand out particularly ahead of most other legends’s AoE powers. It’s not nullified by overhead cover like Bangalore or Gibraltar’s airstrikes, but with a gentle arc (and the help of a double-jump), it can still disrupt the nests of barrier specialists like Rampart and Newcastle.\\nIt\\'s actually quite hard to think of a current character that isn’t either countered or outclassed by at least one of Sparrow’s skills. New legends always launch strong – Respawn openly admit to doing this on purpose, to shock stale metas out of their funk – but I’ve played Apex since day one and this guy is the first one that truly, genuinely feels like a spoilt child whose rich mum has taken them to Bullshit \\'R\\' Us on their birthday. Of course you can have legalised wallhacks, dear. Yes, low cooldowns too. That massive area denial looks nice, doesn’t it. Let’s ask the lady if they have any more movement tech from that mech game your father had killed. Whatever you want.\\nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun/EA\\nObviously, the worst part of all of this is that my desire to keep playing Sparrow is roughly as strong as my fear of becoming a charred, dart-ridden corpse at his hands. It’s a classic case of power corrupting: I know my soul blackens like a publishing executive\\'s every time I sneak up on two warring squads, paint the entire arena in tracker darts, and mop up the survivors with an electric death-pylon launched from half a mile away, and yet I will do it again given the chance. Is this illicit high worth the pain of being in the other end of the exact same engagement? I’m not proud of saying so, but probably yes.\\nSeason 25 does make some other changes worth reporting, but in both the update and this article, they’re overshadowed by Sparrow’s towering murder potential. Pathfinder, once the robotic face of Apex, is getting some buffs, particularly to bump up how often you’ll be able to throw out his grappling hook. I’m down for this – that bit of string is by far the most enjoyable part of Pathy\\'s kit – though after trying him out in the preview build, it rarely felt like he was regaining much of a competitive edge. Thus, it wasn’t long before I was yearning to return to my overtuned Mediterranean boy.\\nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun/EA\\nI much preferred Season 25’s tweaks to the Bocek bow, which include gifting you a full quill of arrows on pickup – surely making it a key target in resource-scrambling hot drops – and the ability to convert any frag grenades in your pack into a handful of explosive arrows. The extra damage on these is only modest, so they’re unlikely to be game-winners by themselves, but they do make missed shots more forgiving so long as they land close enough to clip the target with the microblast. As with charge-up weapons that let you temporarily power up by sacrificing a shield cell or throwable, the “use it or lose it” aspect of these amped shots acts as an effective motivator to get stuck in rather than cautiously hanging back.\\nGranted, that thinking would appear to be at odds with a seasonal update that Respawn say is about \"letting long-range weapons shine.\" Except static scope-to-scope combat is not the new playstyle du jour, at least judging from the rounds I’ve played. If anything, camped out sharpshooters are being tempted to get mobile, be it through those explosive arrows or the new gold-tier attachment for snipers and marksman rifles that removes the move speed penalty while aiming them.\\nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun/EA\\nI don’t know if this will result in lobbies full of bunnyhopping snipers scooting in to blast me point blank, but after last year’s shift to the slow, overly defensive, and widely reviled \"Support meta,\" I’d be inclined to take anything that inspires a more flowing and dynamic style of combat. Even if it means an onslaught of twenty dart-flinging, double-jumping Sparrows in every match, as like I said, the chance to be one of them is enough make the whole prospect a lot more palatable.\\nWhat does put me off playing Season 25, however, is the fear that my time investment might be interpreted by someone, somewhere as a tacit tolerance – if not outright approval – of a business model dependent on routinely depriving hundreds of their livelihoods. A model that takes the labour of, for example, the person that wrote Sparrow into existence, before cutting them out on the eve of their creation\\'s reveal to the world. The game is good.

ASSOCIATED PRESS\\nThe sentence handed down for the brutal murder of a 21-year-old woman has outraged the victim's mother.Tyrone Thompson, who stabbed his ex-girlfriend Mackenzie Anderson 78 times while on parole, was jailed for a maximum 22 years and six months on Friday.He will serve a non-parole period of 15 years and six months.Ms Anderson's distressed mother, Tabitha Acret, ran sobbing from the Newcastle Supreme Court after the sentence was handed down and collapsed outside.'While no verdict and no sentence can bring Mackenzie back, we are outraged by today's outcome,' Ms Acret told reporters.'Whilst this might be thought of as a good outcome for the courts, we are disgusted that this sentence is what they think the value of my daughter's life was worth.'Justice Weinstein's sentence was an insult to women globally and I call for an urgent appeal of this sentence.'Ms Acret said she placed a 'great deal of blame for my daughter's death on the justice system'.In sentencing Thompson, Justice Richard Weinstein said the brutal murder of the mother-of-one was a frenzied attack of such ferocity that one of the two knives he used snapped. Mackenzie Anderson's loss would profoundly impact her family forever, the judge said Tyrone Thompson has been jailed for murdering his ex-girlfriend after stabbing her 78 times. (HANDOUT/9NEWS) Justice Weinstein said the Crown submitted that the seriousness of the crime was aggravated by previous domestic violence in the relationship, Ms Anderson's fear of Thompson and her attempts to end the relationship, which he refused to accept.The judge noted Ms Anderson's family had been shattered by her murder and left with feelings of helplessness, despair and anger.Ms Anderson's loss would profoundly impact her family forever and her death at such a young age was 'every parent's nightmare', he said.But the judge also said Thompson's significant mental health issues, the domestic violence he suffered as a child at the hands of his violent, schizophrenic, drug-addled father, his difficult schooling and exposure to drugs had diminished his moral culpability.Justice Weinstein found Thompson had intended to kill Ms Anderson when he first started stabbing her.Thompson, 25, watched the sentencing via audiovisual link from prison instead of facing his victim's grieving family in court.Thompson had been due to stand trial for murder before pleading guilty in April.In a letter of remorse to the judge, Thompson - who was diagnosed with a complex post-traumatic stress disorder and severe personality disorder but was not considered psychotic - claimed the pair had struggled with a knife and when his hand was cut 'something inside me lost control'. Ms Acret had told the court how her daughter must have suffered a 'fear no human should ever know' on the night she was murdered and had been convinced Thompson would kill her after being paroled.Thompson and Ms Anderson had been involved in an on-again, off-again relationship, marred by domestic violence, since late 2019.He was jailed in October 2021 for assaulting Ms Anderson, intimidating her and destroying her property before being released on parole on March 9, 2022.Thompson, who ignored an apprehended domestic violence order banning him from contacting Ms Anderson, killed her 16 days later after breaking into her apartment in the Newcastle suburb of Mayfield.1800 RESPECT (1800 737 732) Lifeline 13 11 14beyondblue 1300 22 4636\", 'location': 'AUS', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Man jailed for stabbing ex-girlfriend 78 times\\nENTITIES: Mackenzie Anderson, Tyrone Thompson, Tabitha Acret, Justice Richard Weinstein, Newcastle Supreme Court\\nEVENT: Tyrone Thompson was jailed for 22 years and six months for stabbing his ex-girlfriend Mackenzie Anderson 78 times.

The company’s report Thursday comes a few weeks after rival UnitedHealth slashed its 2025 forecast after dealing with a spike in care use.Overall, CVS Health booked adjusted earnings of $2.25 per share as the company’s profit soared 60% to $1.78 billion in the year’s first quarter. Total revenue climbed 7% to $94.59 billion.Analysts expect earnings of $1.70 per share on $93.66 billion in revenue for the first quarter, according to the data firm FactSet.For the full year, CVS Health now expects adjusted earnings to range from $6 to $6.20 per share.The company forecast in February adjusted earnings of $5.75 to $6 per share. Analysts expect $5.92.CVS Health Corp., based in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, runs one of the nation’s largest drugstore chains and a huge pharmacy benefit management business that operates prescription drug coverage for employers, insurers and other big clients. It also covers 27 million people through its Aetna insurance arm.The company also said Thursday that it would leave the Affordable Care Act’s individual marketplaces next year. It currently covers about a million people in that market across 17 states.Company shares jumped 10% to $73.55 before markets opened Thursday.The stock has already climbed more than 48% so far in 2025 after sinking by deeper than 40% last year.

Modern software is nothing short of a risky digital maze for him and millions of others like him.\\nLyft, one of the biggest ride-hailing services in the US, is addressing that digital divide with a new service tailor-made for our aging loved ones. The service, called Lyft Silver, essentially lives as its own experience in the main app, but with a much simpler UI and a few extra accessibility perks.\\nRecommended Videos\\nHow does Lyft Silver work?\\nAll you have to do is launch the Lyft app, open the “You” option in the bottom right corner, and select Lyft Silver. Doing so will instantly switch the app’s UI to a much simpler format with fewer options, quick controls, and large texts.\\nLyft\\nThe font size has been increased by 1.4x, and there are only two buttons on the home screen. One for booking a ride, and the other one for scheduling it. “The goal is to reduce visual distractions that might get in the way of success, or add any confusion,” says the company.\\nFor scenarios where the older riders might need assistance, there is a prominent “Get Help” button in the top right corner of the screen. Tapping on it opens a direct phone line link to a human agent that will be operation between 8am and 9pm EST.\\nWhat’s special about it?\\nAs far as the ride options go, Lyft Silver will only offer two choices viz. Standard and Extra Comfort. Notably, the company has set a certain set of rules for cars that will be moving around older passengers as part of its new service.\\nLyft\\nFor example, the step-in height of the car should not exceed 18 inches, and the seat height shouldn’t surpass the 18-inch limit, either. Moreover, the cars have to be comfortable and spacious. Lyft Silver won’t deploy trucks, sports cars, or utility vehicles.\\nOnce the ride begins, the details will be shareable with trusted contacts such as caregivers and family members for added peace of mind. In the initial phase, Lyft will also offer discounts for older riders in partnership with AltaMed, Urban League, NOAH, SAGE, and Self Help for the Elderly.\\nLyft Silver will begin early access starting May 5th in the United States. It will be accessible within the main Android and iOS app. For those who are a part of the test pool, they can share an invite or a gift link for Lyft Silver via a SMS link with their loved ones.\\nPlease enable Javascript to view this content', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Lyft Silver: Ride Service for Aging Adults\\nENTITIES: Lyft, AltaMed, Urban League, NOAH, SAGE, Self Help for the Elderly\\nEVENT: Lyft is launching Lyft Silver, a ride-hailing service with a simplified UI, larger fonts, direct access to human agents, and vehicle requirements tailored for older passengers, starting May 5th in the US.\\nCONTEXT: Lyft Silver aims to bridge the digital divide for older adults with a simplified interface and accessibility features.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-02T16:09:34.237Z'}, {'id': 42332, 'sourceId': 12511, 'url': 'https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366623309/Co-op-instructs-staff-to-be-wary-of-lurking-hackers', 'title': 'Co-op instructs staff to be wary of lurking hackers', 'publishDate': '2025-05-01T11:31:00.000Z', 'content': 'Oleksii - stock.adobe.com\\nBy\\nAlex Scroxton,\\nSecurity Editor\\nPublished: 01 May 2025 16:31\\nStaffers at Co-op have been told to be on their guard against lurking hackers on their systems as the cooperative – which specialises in retail, insurance and funeralcare – continues to work to mitigate an ongoing cyber attack.\\nThe latest developments, which were first reported by ITV News, came 24 hours after Co-op first shut off parts of its IT systems in a pre-emptive attempt to ward off the danger – an approach that has won plaudits from onlookers.\\nIn an email shared with employees, Co-op’s chief digital and information officer, Rob Elsey, said the attack – which was made public yesterday – actually began last weekend.\\n“If you work from home, you won’t be able to access systems and apps that require you to sign in using a VPN,” wrote Elsey. “If you are having issues accessing systems or need to access applications please work from a Co-op location.”\\nComputer Weekly additionally understands that Co-op users have been instructed to verify attendees for online meetings via Microsoft Teams, to keep their webcams turned on throughout, and under no circumstances to record or transcribe any meetings.\\nSome cyber criminal gangs have been known to access, monitor and exploit internal communications channels in their attacks.\\nThe Lapsus$ gang behind multiple attacks on high-profile targets deployed this tactic to great effect in a 2022 intrusion at Rockstar Games, where a member obtained gameplay footage of the in-development title Grant Theft Auto 6 from an employee Slack channel.\\nNo known link to M&S, but speculation abounds\\nAlthough no link between the incident at Co-op and the attack that has crippled Marks and Spencer’s (M&S’s) online systems has been proven, the fact that two high-profile incidents at UK supermarkets have occurred in the space of a fortnight has raised eyebrows and prompted some speculation as to whether or not the two incidents are related in some way.\\nJason Gerrard, senior director of channel systems engineering for EMEAI at Commvault, said even if there was no link, the two attacks were a gift to the cyber criminal underground. “The increase in IT outages and cyber attacks is becoming extremely hard to ignore and that’s exactly what threat actors are counting on,” he said.\\n“Targeting industry leaders and critical supply chains is a calculated strategy for notoriety and financial gain,” said Gerrard. “Hackers know that compromising a single piece of software can open doors to hundreds of downstream organisations.

Instead of women seeking an abortion in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy needing to take the first pill under medical supervision, they could receive both pills by post after a remote consultation. It was made permanent in 2022, with MPs voting 215 in favour to 188 against.However, inducing a miscarriage remains a crime, punishable with up to life in prison, and in recent years several women have found themselves in the dock for ending their own pregnancies outside the strict legal parameters of the 1967 act.According to freedom of information data from the Crown Prosecution Service, 13 people made a first appearance at a magistrates court charged with abortion-related offences in 2022; four people in 2019; and three in each of 2020 and 2021. The numbers include both men and women.Separate data, from about half of Britain’s police forces, showed at least 11 people were arrested in 2023 on suspicion of child destruction or inducing a miscarriage, including a 31-year-old woman in north Wales “reported to have taken illicit substances to initiate an abortion”.Until 2022, it is believed that only three women had been convicted of having an illegal abortion in the 150 years since the introduction of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, under which illegal abortions are most commonly prosecuted.In the last parliament, MPs had put forward proposals to change the law under the criminal justice bill, with Creasy and a fellow Labour MP, Diana Johnson, proposing different changes to the law. However, the plans, along with the legislation, fell by the wayside with last summer’s general election.Johnson, now a Home Office minister, can no longer table amendments to government legislation. Antoniazzi’s amendment is believed to be similar in scope to the one put forward by Johnson in the last parliament.It is the second so-called vote of conscience in quick succession, with assisted dying legislation expected to come before the Commons before any abortion vote.In a referendum in 2018, Ireland made abortion legal on request up to 12 weeks, and later if the foetus would be likely to die before or shortly after birth or if there was a risk of death or serious harm to a pregnant woman.In 2019, Northern Ireland’s abortion laws were also modernised, allowed up to 12 weeks – and later under limited circumstances.However, in the US, change has gone in the opposite direction. In June 2022, the supreme court ruled that there was no constitutional right to abortion, with the laws now decided at state level. About 22 million women of reproductive age have had access restricted, with abortion banned in more than a dozen states.Whether either of the amendments are selected for debate and put to a vote will be a matter for the speaker. But with broad cross-party support for a change in the law, it is likely there will be a vote on the issue.“In the last five years, around 100 women have been investigated by police for a ‘crime’ that does not even apply in two nations of the United Kingdom,” Antoniazzi told the Guardian.“The damage this outdated law is inflicting upon women affected is immeasurable. I feel a moral imperative to act. I am leading a cross-party group of parliamentarians and have been working with the sector on the reform we desperately need to put a stop to this. I will be laying an amendment in that vein to the crime and policing bill in the coming weeks.”Heidi Stewart, the chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), said: “BPAS, alongside a coalition of royal colleges, medical bodies and women’s rights groups, are calling on MPs to reform our archaic abortion law and end the prosecution of women accused of ending their own pregnancies. We fully supported the amendment tabled by Diana Johnson MP to the criminal justice bill in 2024 and we hope that this parliament will take these proposals forward as a matter of urgency.”Creasy’s amendment seeks to write a human right to access abortion into law. “Other countries have enshrined a human right to access abortion – doing that here and writing this right into law for the first time ever could help prevent any rollback in rights and provide a future for ensuring everyone can access a safe and legal abortion if they choose to do so,” she said.', 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: MPs to vote on abortion decriminalization\\nENTITIES: Tonia Antoniazzi, Stella Creasy, Diana Johnson, British Pregnancy Advisory Service, England, Wales\\nEVENT: MPs will vote on decriminalizing abortion in England and Wales via amendments to government legislation.\\nCONTEXT: Decriminalization aims to prevent prosecution of women ending pregnancies outside legal parameters.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-02T16:09:34.237Z'}, {'id': 43970, 'sourceId': 12631, 'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8d4yvg1lzgo', 'title': 'Runcorn and Helsby: All you need to know on key by-election', 'publishDate': '2025-05-01T21:52:28.000Z', 'content': '19 hours agoKaleigh WattersonCheshire political reporter, BBC News•kaleighnewsEPAThe by-election was triggered by the resignation of Mike Amesbury, who was convicted earlier this year of assaulting a constituent.What\\'s the background?On 27 February, Amesbury was given a 10-week prison sentence and taken straight to HMP Altcourse in Liverpool.After three nights behind bars, a judge agreed to suspend Amesbury\\'s jail term for two years.Under concerted pressure to quit the House of Commons, Amesbury - who lost the Labour whip after he was arrested last autumn and has since been sitting as an independent MP - agreed to stand down.What is the make-up of Runcorn and Helsby?Runcorn and Helsby includes the towns of Runcorn, Frodsham and Helsby, as well as various villages and a significant rural area.In total, 22% of the constituency is classed as a built-up area, 60% rural and 14% as water or wetland.It has a population of 93,520, with 21% of residents under 18, 57% aged 18-64 and 21% over 65.What is the electoral history of the constituency?Runcorn and Helsby is a new constituency that was only created in time for the general election in July 2024.More than half of it (51.2%) came from the former constituency of Weaver Vale, with 37.1% from Halton and the remainder from three other former constituencies - Ellesmere Port and Neston, Eddisbury, and City of Chester.At the 2024 general election, Amesbury won Runcorn and Helsby for Labour with 52.9% of the vote, a majority of 14,696.Reform UK came second with 18% of the vote, ahead of the Conservatives on 16%, the Green Party with 6.4%, and the Liberal Democrats with 5.1%.Two smaller parties received 1.4% between them.Amesbury was the Labour MP for Weaver Vale from June 2017 until the seat was abolished before the general election.He gained the seat from Conservative Graham Evans, who had been the constituency\\'s MP since 2010.Meanwhile, from its creation in 1983, Halton was always held by Labour.Derek Twigg - who is now the MP for Widnes and Halewood - held it from 1997.Why is this by-election so important?This will be Sir Keir Starmer\\'s first by-election as prime minister.A lot has happened in the nine months since Labour swept to power, with several tax rises announced in the Budget, and ongoing negotiations with President Trump about world trade and the war in Ukraine.University of Liverpool Professor Jon Tonge recently told BBC Politics North West that, as one of the safest Labour seats in the country, it would be \"quite some feat\" if another party were to take Runcorn and Helsby.If recent opinion polls are anything to go by, though, Reform UK may well be confident heading into the by-election, not least because they came second there in July.The Conservatives will be hoping for signs of a recovery too. They came third in Runcorn and Helsby last time around, and they were not far behind Reform.There is a lot at stake for everyone.Who are the candidates?A total of 15 candidates are standing in the by-election.Listed alphabetically, they are as follows:Catherine Anne Blaiklock (English Democrats)Dan Clarke (Liberal Party)Chris Copeman (Green Party)Paul Duffy (Liberal Democrats)Peter Ford (Workers Party)Howling Laud Hope (Monster Raving Loony Party)Sean Houlston (Conservatives)Jason Philip Hughes (Volt UK)Alan McKie (independent)Graham Harry Moore (English Constitution Party)Paul Andrew Murphy (Social Democratic Party)Sarah Pochin (Reform)Karen Shore (Labour)John Stevens (Rejoin EU)Michael Williams (independent)', 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Runcorn and Helsby by-election: Key details\\nENTITIES: Runcorn, Helsby, Mike Amesbury, Keir Starmer, Reform UK, Conservatives, Labour\\nEVENT: A by-election is being held in Runcorn and Helsby after Mike Amesbury resigned following a conviction for assaulting a constituent.

But the relief was immense.In the bottom of the second inning Wednesday afternoon, on the last day of what had been a torturous opening month to the season,Max Muncy finally did the thing that had eluded him over an ice-cold start.After 29 forgettable games and 90 infuriating at-bats, the 10th-year veteran finally hit his first home run.With a lightning-quick swing on a down-and-away, 92-mph sinker from Miami Marlins right-hander Cal Quantrill, Muncy put a long-awaited end to his longest home run drought — and some much-needed life into his slumping start.His 433-foot solo blast landed high up in the deepest part of the right field pavilion. It sent his Dodgers teammates in the dugout into a frenzy.And though Muncy did little more than pound a closed fist into his open palm as he trotted around the bases for the first time, it allowed him to finally release the emotional tensions that had been building on the inside.“Felt really good to have that happen,” Muncy told reporters from his clubhouse locker afterward, finally allowing himself to smile after a season-best game in which he also tripled and drew a walk.“Just hope today is something to build on,” he added. “It’s been a rough month.”For much of March and April, there was much amiss in Muncy’s play.The slugger was batting just .180 entering Wednesday, a troubling mark even for a traditionally low-average hitter. He had struck out 34 times and walked only 14, a master of the free pass going at one point eight straight games without drawing one. Muncy’s defense, quietly an area of improvement for the 34-year-old last season, also cratered. He has committed four errors at third base, all on errant throws. His advanced analytics have tanked, going from an above-league-average mark in Statcast’s “outs above average” metric last year to the third-lowest grade of any qualified third baseman.Amid the mounting frustration he even became the subject of a viral social media video during the trip to Chicago last week, captured glaring at a fan who was shouting profanities about him and his family as he boarded the team’s bus outside Wrigley Field following a loss to the Cubs.“Playing in L.A. is not easy,” Muncy said. “It’s a privilege, and it’s a privilege to play under this pressure. It’s something I’ve always thrived on. But it doesn’t mean it’s been easy, for me or my family.” The Dodgers’ Max Muncy reacts as he runs the bases after hitting a home run Wednesday against the Marlins. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times) Nothing about Muncy’s performance raised more red flags than his lack of home runs.Ever since his successful emergence as a minor-league reclamation project seven years ago, power had been his trademark. Even in stretches when his batting average hovered around the Mendoza Line, or his strikeout total climbed leaderboards, his ability to slug had been the great equalizer.Entering the year, Muncy’s 190 long balls with the Dodgers ranked top-10 in franchise history. His four seasons with at least 35 were topped only by Duke Snider.And yet he failed to hit one in his first 28 games. Entering Wednesday he was in danger of going an entire month without a home run, something that never had happened since he joined the Dodgers.“Pretty puzzling,” manager Dave Roberts said last week of Muncy’s power outage, which also contributed to a slugging percentage in the low .200s. “I know he’s trying to find his way out.”At the root of Muncy’s woes was a swing he has been tinkering with since the offseason.Last year the two-time All-Star had one of his most productive seasons. His .232 batting average was his best since 2021. His 141 OPS+ (an all-encompassing advanced offensive metric) trailed only his breakout 2018 performance for the highest of his career. In the National League Championship Series he set a postseason record by reaching base 12 consecutive times.Despite that Muncy still went into the winter feeling like there was more to unlock. One of the big changes he made was in the type of contact he was chasing. After hitting almost 75% of his balls in the air last season, he felt a lower angle of trajectory might improve the consistency of his production.“I spent all offseason and spring trying to hit low liners and ground balls,” Muncy said earlier this year, “to try and be on top of the ball.”The only problem: That mechanical adjustment came with unforeseen side effects.During the season’s first couple of weeks, Muncy realized he was lurching forward on his swings in an effort to keep the ball down. It not only got him out of his prime hitting position, but also gave him a fraction-of-a-second less reaction time to read each pitch and make the right swing decision.“The ball sped up on me the first few series of the season and I really wasn’t myself,” Muncy said. “I was chasing a lot of stuff and I was unable to recognize it. It was very uncharacteristic of me.”So, more recently, Muncy has been recalibrating at the plate. He’s made an effort to stay back in his swing, closely dissecting video of his at-bats to make sure his mechanics remain in sync. He’s rediscovered his feel for the strike zone, recording almost as many walks (12) as strikeouts (13) since his eight-game stretch without a free pass. He reached base 10 times during the Dodgers’ five-game winning streak.“It seems like he goes through stretches where he’s really scuffling, and he always finds a way to get out of it,” Roberts said.“The swing feels like it’s getting closer and closer,” Muncy added. “I still have to clean some things up. Have to be better in certain situations. It’s a work in progress. But … it’s just getting the ball to go forward.”On Wednesday it got the ball to go out of the yard too — helping Muncy finally flash some pop.“We all know Max is going to be Max,” first baseman Freddie Freeman said. “For him to get that first one, hopefully the floodgates open for him.”Freeman was one of several teammates who had an elated reaction to Muncy’s home run, pumping both fists above his head from the dugout. When Muncy finished rounding the bases, Mookie Betts wrapped him in a bear hug, while Teoscar Hernández showered him with a supersized serving of his sunflower seed celebration.“He got me pretty good,” Muncy joked from his locker.From a few stalls over, Hernández chimed in: “He deserved it!”“When you feel the support from your teammates — that elation, that joy — it gets emotional,” Roberts added. “That just speaks to how much it’s been wearing on him. The struggles. And the lack of a homer.”That latter concern, at least, has been alleviated. And though Muncy’s batting average is still a lowly .194 and his on-base-plus-slugging percentage is still an underwhelming .610, he noted he finally might have “something I can build on” entering May with renewed confidence at the plate.“It was huge for me, almost a little emotional,” Muncy said. “But this clubhouse is very tight, very close. Everyone cares about each other in here. We all just want to win, and for us to win, everyone needs to be clicking. That’s something this whole clubhouse buys into. So just to get that kind of greeting felt amazing.” More to Read', 'location': 'N/A', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Max Muncy hits first home run of season\\nENTITIES: Max Muncy, Los Angeles Dodgers, Miami Marlins, Cal Quantrill, Dave Roberts, Freddie Freeman, Mookie Betts, Teoscar Hernández\\nEVENT: Max Muncy hit his first home run of the season, ending a long drought and providing a potential turning point after struggling with mechanical adjustments to his swing.\\nCONTEXT: Muncy's adjustment and first home run offer hope for improved performance after a slow start.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-02T16:09:34.237Z'}, {'id': 39536, 'sourceId': 12389, 'url': 'https://www.menshealth.com/trending-news/a64419898/a-golfers-guide-to-ocean-city/', 'title': 'A Golfer’s Guide to Ocean City', 'publishDate': '2025-05-01T14:00:00.000Z', 'content': 'Beyond just sand and surf, Ocean City, Maryland, is also now one of the world’s best golf destinations. While many might know this coastal town for its famous boardwalk, Candy Kitchens, and amusement parks, it’s become a favorite among pro champions and golf amateurs alike. Today, there are more than 20 golf courses within 25 miles, all set in serene landscapes along Maryland’s lushly forested tidal marshes and waterways.

Their future depends on practical, fair and responsive policy. To ensure their ongoing success, MGA urges all Parties and Candidates to support action across five critical areas:\\nSimplifying Employment Law\\nAustralia’s employment laws are overly complex and increasingly difficult to navigate and understand, which can serve to discourage employers taking on more staff as well as failing to meet the modern flexibility needs of younger workers.\\nCrack Down on Illicit Tobacco\\nIllicit tobacco undermines independent retailers and shrinks Federal tax revenue.

People who wanted to read or see things that reflected their experience in a grown-up way, in which they could recognize familiar challenges, rendered as comedy or tragedy. It was the opposite of “juvenile.”There was definitely a market for such things, perhaps even a market dominated by them — films like “Kramer vs. Kramer,” “The Big Chill” and “An Unmarried Woman” pop to my aged mind. Even young(er) people, before they had the option of watching themselves exclusively, took an interest, if memory serves. (Maybe they still, do; let me know, young people.) The “49 and over” demographic may not be TV’s most prized, but it’s a fat slice of the population and many own televisions.So there is something old-fashioned about “The Four Seasons,” a very watchable, breezy, bumpy new Netflix comedy from Tina Fey, Lang Fisher and Tracey Wigfield, remaking a super-successful 1981 movie about no-longer-young marrieds. (Alan Alda, who wrote, directed and starred in the film makes a cameo appearance here, so we may infer his approval.)The TV version adds original twists and new scenes — the series lasts twice as long as the film, after all — but generally follows the shape of the original story and the character of its characters, who share names with their prototypes (though Claudia has become Claude). It’s an adult entertainment in the original sense, notwithstanding a character “only” in her early 30s, with jokes about aches and pains, flagging energy, earlier bedtimes, the stresses of long relationships in longer lives, and here and there a sense of nostalgia for the people they used to be. Many will relate. Steve Carell and Kerri Kenney-Silver also star as a couple, married 25 years, who separate. (Jon Pack / Netflix) The narrative gambit concerns three couples who meet for a holiday every three months, if you can imagine that. They are upper-middle class, upper-middle-age, and in such control of their lives that they can afford to take, like, a week off four times a year. Their vacation schedule brings them together in spring, summer, fall and winter — in that order, in the story — a plan that conveniently allows for Vivaldi’s well-known violin concerti to fill up the soundtrack. More to Read Fey plays Kate, married to Jack (Will Forte), who is a history teacher; anyway, he is very hot on a biography of Napoleon. (It doesn’t really matter what anyone does for work; some of them have jobs, but all of them have money.) Jack briefly worked for hedge-fund guy Nick (Steve Carell), at whose upstate New York lake house, shared with wife Anne (Kerri Kenney-Silver), the first movement of this “Four Seasons” takes place. Danny (Colman Domingo), who was in college with Jack and Kate, is an interior designer, married to Claude (Marco Calvani), an emotional Italian, whose main (pre)occupation is worrying about Danny’s health. (Jack worries about his own health, but he is merely a hypochondriac.)It begins a little slow — a little “why should we care about these people, with their abundant vacation time?” Perhaps it was just class resentment on my part. Soon enough, however, things start to percolate, with Nick’s announcement that he is leaving Anne; her replacement in their pod is his dental hygienist, Ginny (Erika Henningsen, from Fey’s “Mean Girls” musical), a lively young woman in her 30s. (Her age — that is to say, she’s an adult — will be pointed out.) No one speaks the words “midlife crisis” — maybe that’s not a thing anyone says anymore? (Research shows the term has been with us 60 years, long enough to have a midlife crisis of its own.) But both Nick and Ginny take pains to declare it’s not like that. And it’s true that Anne, currently addicted to playing some farm game on her iPad and not using the potting shed, complete with kiln, that Nick built her, has let joy leak from her life. Erika Henningsen plays Ginny, Nick’s (Steve Carell) new love interest. (Francisco Roman / Netflix) Nick’s energized romantic do-si-do destabilizes the group, and gives them something new to gossip about and compare their own lives with as they wobble through the ensuing year. Ginny comes into view in the third (summer) episode, set in the Bahamas, where, indulged by Nick, she has booked the six of them into an uncomfortable vegan eco-resort. (Naturally, the writers will have some fun at the expense of eco-veganism, and of the older characters’ reaction to it.) Fall is set during parents weekend at the New England college where Kate and Jack, and Anne and Nick, each have a daughter enrolled (Ashlyn Maddox and Julia Lester, respectively) and where Kate, Jack and Danny were students. Winter finds them in a chalet up a snowy mountain, with a return to the lake house for circular closure.Dramatically, Carell’s storyline is dominant, and he’s sympathetic in a part that doesn’t hesitate to make him look silly. But Fey, being Fey — “SNL” headwriter, winner of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, named the best comedian of the 21st century by the Guardian, twice listed on the Time 100, four times chosen one of People magazine’s most beautiful people, and the series’ designated Least Quirky character — comes across as its hub, its central intelligence. (Which puts Forte’s definitely quirky character at something of a disadvantage.)If one is as aware of watching famous faces like Fey and Carell and Forte and Domingo at work as following the people they’re playing, of course it’s nice to see them, and knowing them as actors doesn’t relieve the tension their characters create as they scrape against each other. (Everybody’s got problems.) Across the course of the show we will learn that marriage is work, that not everybody believes in soulmates, that people in a new relationship might have more and noisier sex than those who have been together for many years, and that humans have the capacity to drive one another crazy, perhaps especially on vacation — a sad irony. There will be tension within and between the couples; some of their annoyance may in turn annoy the viewer.But that, I suppose, is the desired effect, and when the characters do wake up to one another, “The Four Seasons” can be quite moving.', 'location': 'N/A', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Netflix's 'The Four Seasons' Explores Midlife Marriage\\nENTITIES: Tina Fey, Lang Fisher, Tracey Wigfield, Alan Alda, Steve Carell, Kerri Kenney-Silver, Netflix\\nEVENT: Netflix releases 'The Four Seasons,' a comedy series remaking the 1981 film, focusing on three couples navigating midlife challenges and relationship dynamics through seasonal vacations.\\nCONTEXT: The show explores the complexities of marriage and relationships at midlife, offering relatable and moving moments.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-02T16:09:34.237Z'}, {'id': 44081, 'sourceId': 12655, 'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74zexgkg7wo', 'title': 'Cash has benefits, say Wiltshire small businesses', 'publishDate': '2025-05-02T05:40:56.000Z', 'content': '11 hours agoBBCBradley Buechel runs a coffee shop and a tyre business and has no issue with accepting cashSome small business owners in Wiltshire have said trading in cash has benefits - after the government said that, for now, firms will not be forced to accept it.

Today, it was announced that it will transfer to London’s West End in May, after short runs at London’s Old Vic in 2024 and Toronto earlier this year.But Ure argues that the day-long Live Aid could never happen today, because of the seductive pull of social media feeds. “Have [audiences] got the attention span? I’m not sure,” he says.Live Aid was held to raise money for famine relief in Ethiopia, and Ure says that he and the team behind it were powered by a cocktail of naivety and rock-star arrogance – logistical hurdles were deemed immaterial. “We hadn’t figured out just what a task this was going to be,” he says. “Just get the show done. Sparkle, guys!”They had had major success with Band Aid’s Do They Know It’s Christmas? single in December 1984, written by Ultravox frontman Ure alongside Bob Geldof, but it had ended up exposing bottlenecks that were stopping the money getting to where it was most needed. A concert was conceived to swiftly raise the funds to eradicate those problems.“There was a trucking cartel in situ in Ethiopia that all the aid agencies were using and had to pay for,” says Ure. “We wanted to break the cartel by buying a fleet of trucks, but we didn’t have the money to do it. So Live Aid was born.”George Harrison’s 1971 Concert for Bangladesh charity show and album were used to show how good intentions can be dashed by mismanagement: millions of dollars raised by the concert were trapped in IRS tax escrow accounts for years. “The first advice we were given was from George,” says Ure of the early planning stages for Live Aid. “He said to Bob, ‘Don’t do what we did. Don’t spend any of the money. No overheads.’”Ure and Bob Geldof at the Wembley launch. Photograph: Gareth Cattermole/Getty ImagesFrugality became the Band Aid Charitable Trust’s mantra – it has never had an office and all trustees still work for free, with expenses forbidden. Money continues to come in from licensing, streams (of the Band Aid single at Christmas and YouTube footage of Live Aid) and donations, and 10% of proceeds from Just for One Day will support it. Total funds raised in the trust’s lifetime have reached £150m. “We have people leaving money to us in their wills,” says Ure. “Our job as trustees is to generate as much money as we possibly can for the cause.”The 71-year-old Ure accepts that the social context of Live Aid in 1985 can be knotty to explain in 2025. The Band Aid lyrics – such as Bono’s line “tonight thank God it’s them instead of you” – have prompted accusations of white saviourhood, and African artists such as Fuse ODG have argued it created a patronising and flattened view of a whole continent. “We wrote it in an afternoon as a simple pop song and it’s not there to be analysed,” counters Ure. “It was there to do something. Was it done with good intent? Yes, it was. Did it make a difference? Yes, it did.”He feels, in retrospect, Live Aid marked the end of the old world, where music was the epicentre of culture, and the start of something less monolithic. Having a whole day of TV programming devoted to a concert raising money for a single cause could not work in today’s oversaturated and media-fragmented world, he feels.Speaking at the musical’s launch event on Thursday, Geldof made a similar point. “The problem is, do people have the bandwidth?” he said. “They’re so exhausted with the horror of Gaza and the terror of Ukraine and the American political situation that it’s hard to draw attention to those who through no fault of their own are dying right now.”For Ure, what was a unifying media spectacle then would not cohere now. “I think Charlie Brooker will be writing the next Black Mirror [about this],” he jokes. “Fans in the audience would be filming it and then they’d swipe their screens and the artists would disappear after 30 seconds. It’s a different world.”', 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Midge Ure reflects on Live Aid legacy\\nENTITIES: Midge Ure, Live Aid, Bob Geldof, Band Aid, U2, Queen, David Bowie, Ethiopia\\nEVENT: Midge Ure reflects on the legacy of Live Aid as a stage musical, Just for One Day, prepares to transfer to London's West End.

Critics described it as an ideological statement.The report relied on scientific evidence reviews of such treatments as hormone therapy and puberty blockers that were published when these treatments were first made available to transgender adolescents.Credit...Carolyn Kaster/Associated PressMay 1, 2025Federal health officials published a report on Thursday declaring that the use of hormonal and surgical treatments in young people with gender dysphoria lacked scientific evidence and expressing concern about long-term harms, a stark reversal from previous agency recommendations and the advice of top U.S. medical groups.The report instead prioritized the role of psychotherapy, a divisive intervention to treat gender dysphoria that many advocates and physicians have equated with so-called conversion therapy.Other parts of the review seemed to call into question the very notion that some people have a gender identity that does not align with their sex at birth.In January, President Trump signed an executive order titled “Protecting Children From Chemical and Surgical Mutilation” giving the Department of Health and Human Services 90 days to produce a report on the best practices for treating young people who say their gender does not align with their birth sex.But the order made it clear that the administration had already reached its own conclusion about gender transition treatments for minors, characterizing the “blatant harm done to children” as a “stain on our nation’s history.”The 400-page report took a more sober tone but reached a similar conclusion. In a remarkable departure from the standard for medical evidence reviews, the authors were not identified pending a post-publication review process that would begin in “the coming days.”Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

After all, seltzer is little more than plain water infused with carbon dioxide gas to make it fizzy.“Seltzer or carbonated water is generally beneficial because we are all underhydrated, and most people do not hydrate sufficiently during the day,” says Dr. David Poppers, a professor of medicine and director of GI quality and strategy initiatives at NYU Langone Health. “It’s hydrating, and it doesn’t have the calories that are associated with other drinks.”So for those who prefer seltzer over still, it’s fine for most people to drink it regularly. But there are some caveats. Here’s what you need to know before you start subsisting off of seltzer.It may irritate your bladderFor most people, it won’t have this effect. But if you have interstitial cystitis (a chronic condition that causes pain and pressure in the bladder area), or an overactive or sensitive bladder, “the carbonation in seltzer can potentially irritate the bladder lining and exacerbate symptoms like urgency or discomfort,” says Dr. Dana Cohen, a physician specializing in integrative medicine in New York City and co-author of the book Quench: Beat Fatigue, Drop Weight, and Heal Your Body Through the New Science of Optimum Hydration.The best way to tell if this is happening to you is to pay attention to your urinary symptoms after drinking seltzer.It could improve your digestionDrinking seltzer “is beneficial for helping with regular bowel movements and constipation,” Poppers says. “Like regular water, carbonated water is important for gut health and motility.” Read More: What to Eat When You're SickSome research has found that carbonated water can help people who have chronic indigestion, and a study from Japan found that drinking carbonated water even increases short-term feelings of fullness more than drinking regular water does.Seltzer might give you gas or heartburn“For people who are prone to acid reflux, bloating, or gas, the bubbles [in seltzer] can increase intra-abdominal pressure and trigger or worsen symptoms,” Cohen says. Those excess bubbles have to come out somewhere, so don’t be surprised if you experience burping or farting after drinking seltzer.When it comes to heartburn, “the carbonation can relax the lower esophageal sphincter, making it easier for stomach contents and acid to travel upward and cause heartburn,” Cohen explains. This is especially true if you drink it rapidly. Her advice is to pair seltzer with food, rather than drinking it on an empty stomach, to help reduce its impact on reflux.\\xa0\\xa0It could take a toll on your teethFor anyone who consumes seltzer frequently throughout the day, be aware that it may damage your teeth because it’s slightly acidic—though not nearly as acidic as soda. “Sipping on it for hours prolongs the low pH [a marker of acid] in your mouth, causing enamel to break down and demineralize,” explains Lilya Horowitz, a general and cosmetic dentist and owner of Domino Dental in Brooklyn. This can make the teeth susceptible to cavities and small fractures, she adds.She recommends sipping seltzer for 15 to 20 minutes at a time, rather than all day long, and to alternate seltzer with less acidic drinks like herbal tea, coconut water, or plain water.Read More: What’s the Most Refreshing Drink That’s Not Water?Drinking seltzer through a straw can also help protect your teeth from the acid, though drinking any liquid through a straw may add to gassiness (because you’re likely to swallow air) and wrinkles around the mouth, says Dawn Jackson Blatner, a registered dietitian nutritionist in Chicago. It’s a good idea to “rinse your mouth with plain water after sipping seltzer so it’s not sitting on your teeth,” she says.Keep in mind that in many parts of the U.S., tap water contains added fluoride to protect your teeth—so if you’re relying exclusively on canned or bottled carbonated water, you won’t get the benefits. But if you use tap water to make fizzy water at home with a carbonation machine, you will.The good news for your bonesA concern to cross off the worry list: It was once believed that consumption of any bubbly beverage, including seltzer, is bad for bone health—but that’s not true of seltzer. It is, however, true of colas, which contain phosphoric acid that interferes with calcium absorption.The bottom line on bubbly water“The key is moderation—drinking one to three cans of plain seltzer per day will be safe for most people, especially if it helps them meet their hydration goals,” says registered dietitian Eric Williamson, director of nutrition at Canyon Ranch Tucson. “Just be mindful of added ingredients, your own digestive comfort, and how it fits into your overall dietary pattern.”It’s best to steer clear of fizzy waters that contain added sugars or artificial sweeteners, Cohen says. These ingredients can irritate the digestive tract, the bladder, or the teeth for people who are sensitive to them.If a carbonated water contains “natural flavors” that are derived from fruits (like oranges or berries), vegetables (like cucumber), herbs (like mint), or spices (like ginger), that’s unlikely to cause problems. The only way to know what’s in the can or bottle is to read the label.\", 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Seltzer water: benefits, risks, and moderation\\nENTITIES: Dr. David Poppers, Dr. Dana Cohen, Lilya Horowitz, Dawn Jackson Blatner, Eric Williamson\\nEVENT: The article discusses the pros and cons of drinking seltzer water, including its effects on hydration, digestion, bladder irritation, teeth, and bones, advising moderation and awareness of individual sensitivities.\\nCONTEXT: Seltzer can be a healthy alternative to sugary drinks, but moderation is key to avoid potential side effects.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-02T16:09:34.237Z'}, {'id': 41343, 'sourceId': 12432, 'url': 'https://www.nasa.gov/learning-resources/nasa-invests-in-future-stem-workforce-through-space-grant-awards/', 'title': 'NASA Invests in Future STEM Workforce Through Space Grant Awards\\xa0 - NASA', 'publishDate': '2025-05-01T16:19:40.000Z', 'content': '3 Min Read\\nNASA STEM TeamMay 01, 2025 Article\\nNASA is awarding up to $870,000 annually to 52 institutions across the United States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico over the next four years.

This page will be regularly updated so you can track who is polling up, how the independents are faring and how the parties stand with different demographics.This first chart is based on a poll averaging model developed by political scientists at the University of Sydney. It factors in sample sizes, previous results and “house effects” (bias towards a party) of each pollster.There is a lot of uncertainty in political polling and modelling and these charts show a range that likely contains the support for each party. You can read more in our methodology at the end of the page.The next shows a timeline of the two-party preferred (2pp) vote since 2022: Tracking the two party preferred support for Labor and the Coalition Circles show the two party preferred support for each political group in individual polls. The shaded area indicates the credibility interval* for the averaged 2pp. Events labelled are to provide context only, and do not necessarily indicate events that resulted in change in support. Last updated undefined Looking at two-party support alone can obscure one of the biggest stories of the last election: almost a third of votes were for independents and other parties.The 68.5% primary votes share for Labor and the Coalition is an all time low and the continuation of a steady decline since the two parties claimed 98% of votes in 1951.The chart below shows the primary votes for Labor, the Coalition, Greens and others/independents. It is based on the same model as our main tracker, starting with the vote share at the last election. Use the drop-down menu to see what has changed over different periods since the election.To get a sample that reflects the nation at large, pollsters collect a lot of demographic information, including age, sex, location and education.Polling companies occasionally release two-party preferred measures for these sub-demographics.The following charts use simple rolling averages to try to find the underlying trend in two-party support. There has been no adjustment for sample size, house effects, weighting or release date.The first shows support by the age group of the respondent.The next chart groups respondents by education – those with no tertiary education, those with a Tafe or technical education, and those with university education.The chart below groups respondents by sex – male or female. As the numbers are rolling averages, they will not always add up to 100.The final demographic category is state. Data is not available for all states, largely because of their size. Tasmania, for instance, makes up about 2% of the population. A representative sample of 1,000 Australians would have far too few Tasmanians to provide a robust estimate.The final table shows the two-party preferred share for all of the polls that feed into our models.table showing pollsPoll Tracker FAQ: Notes and methodsWhat does Guardian Australia’s poll tracker actually do?Most Australian political polls have a sample size of a little over 1,000 respondents. There’s only so much any one of these polls can tell you. And the fluctuations between polls and for the same pollster across time can often just be statistical noise.The poll tracker pools all of the polls using a model developed by political scientists at the University of Sydney. It assumes political intentions yesterday are similar to today and today is like tomorrow, but with small random changes.The model starts, and is anchored to, the actual 2022 election results. And it assumes polling organisations’ bias is fixed. This is what was observed in previous elections, such as in 2019.Why does the polling model draw a line below Labor’s actual poll numbers (the circles) while the Coalition’s line goes right through their polling numbers?As noted above - the model begins with the last election results and assumes voting intentions evolve over time. The model indicates the polls are overestimating the Labor vote. This pattern was also observed between the 2016 and 2019 elections. In that period the model was correcting for the pollsters’ systematic bias between those elections.Is the Guardian Australia tracker a prediction of who is going to win the election?No. It is simply an aggregation of the public polls. It is a snapshot in time of people’s stated voting intentions, which can change.Why have we changed the poll tracker format/What is the range we are showing?Every time we update the poll tracker the model runs thousands of simulations. The first version of this page only showed the average of these simulations – a single number. Our charts did include a credibility interval - sometimes also known as a margin of error. But highlighting just one number implied greater certainty than the data warranted.The refresh to the page puts the emphasis on the credibility interval. We are using a 95% credibility interval - there is a 95% chance that the actual support for each party is inside this range. We are aiming to emphasise that there is a degree of uncertainty to both the results of any one poll and an aggregate of polls.Why are we using a rolling average for some things instead of the same poll average model?The demographic data is not consistent. Not every pollster releases demographic breakdowns, and the ones that do don’t necessarily release it with each poll. There can be months in between releases for some demographic variables, such as voting intention by level of education.But this data is still useful and should be included in some form. Given we can’t model the data in the same way, we are instead using a simple rolling average to track it over time.Notes and methods\\nThe main poll tracker is based on work by Dr Luke Mansillo and Prof Simon Jackman. You can find their paper here.\\nThe model in different disciplines is called a hidden Markov model or a state space model and employs a Kalman filter algorithm that uses a series of measurements over time, including statistical noise and other inaccuracies, to produce estimates.\\nThese types of models are often used in fields such as robotics, economics and medicine to create estimates from noisy measurements.\\nEach newly published poll is treated as a new measurement, with the model factoring in new data in the context of what has come before.\\nThe model begins with (is anchored to) the vote share for each party at the last federal election.\\nOnly polls with a defined sampling procedure, reported sample size and fielding dates have been included in our dataset. Polls are sliced over the days that they are in the field.\\nSample sizes are adjusted to account for non-response, with effective sample size fed into the model.\\nThe model calculates house effects for each pollster dynamically, by finding systematic differences to what would be expected, given the current average.\\nThe two-party preferred vote is adjusted to remove unknowns or nonresponses, leaving only Labor and Coalition shares.\\nThe model is run 1,000 times for each update', 'location': 'AUS', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Australian Election 2025: Polls Track Party Support\\nENTITIES: Labor, Coalition, University of Sydney\\nEVENT: Australian election polls are tracked and averaged to show support for Labor, Coalition, Greens, and independents, including demographic breakdowns.\\nCONTEXT: Poll averaging model tracks Australian federal election support.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-02T16:09:34.237Z'}, {'id': 41100, 'sourceId': 927, 'url': 'https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/netanyahus-campaign-irans-nuclear-program-muted-trump-power-121387220', 'title': \"Netanyahu's campaign against Iran's nuclear program is muted with Trump in power\", 'publishDate': '2025-05-02T05:50:32.000Z', 'content': 'JERUSALEM -- When the U.S. and Iran met for nuclear talks a decade ago, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu railed against an emerging deal from the world’s most public stages, including in a fiery speech to Congress seen as a direct challenge to the Obama administration as it was wrapping up the talks.Now, as the sides sit down to discuss a new deal, Netanyahu has fallen silent.Netanyahu sees an Iran with nuclear weapons as an existential threat to Israel, and he is just as wary of any new U.S. agreement with its archenemy that may not meet his standards. Yet he finds himself shackled with Donald Trump in the White House. Netanyahu is unwilling to publicly criticize a president who has shown broad support for Israel, whom he deems to be Israel\\'s greatest friend, and who doesn\\'t take well to criticism.He “can\\'t do anything that goes against Trump. He\\'s paralyzed,” said Yoel Guzansky, an Iran expert at the Institute for National Security Studies, a Tel Aviv-based think tank. Israel is in a position of power against Iran after a series of strategic achievements over the past 18 months in the wars that have shaken the Middle East. It thrashed Iran’s allies in Lebanon, Gaza and Syria, and directly attacked Iran last year, neutralizing some of its key air defenses. Experts say Israel now has a window of opportunity for what could be an effective strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities, with possibly less regional blowback.Yet Israel’s leader was recently unable to galvanize Trump to prioritize a strike against Iran’s nuclear facilities — which would likely hinge on U.S. military assistance to be successful. With the U.S. negotiating with Iran, Israel has little legitimacy to pursue a military option on its own.“Netanyahu is trapped,” said Eytan Gilboa, an expert on U.S.-Israel relations at Bar-Ilan University near Tel Aviv. “He was banking on Israel’s position relative to Iran to improve under Trump. In practice, it’s the opposite.” Netanyahu and his nationalist supporters hoped Trump’s return to the White House would be advantageous because of his history of support for Israel. They thought that, under Trump, the U.S. might back a strike on Iranian nuclear facilities. But Trump’s approach to Iran — as well as on other issues, such as tariffs — has shown the relationship is more complicated, and that Trump’s interests don’t entirely align with Netanyahu’s.Netanyahu has long accused Iran of developing a nuclear weapon and went on a global campaign against the Obama deal. He painted the nuclear program as an existential threat to Israel and the world, and said the agreement was too weak to contain it. Israel remains the Mideast\\'s only nuclear-armed state, an advantage it would like to keep.With Netanyahu\\'s strong encouragement, Trump backed out of the deal struck by Obama. And since returning to the White House, Trump has given Israel free rein in its war against Hamas in Gaza, been soft on the worsening humanitarian crisis in the territory and launched strikes against the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have attacked Israel since the start of the war.But now that the U.S. has returned to the negotiating table with Iran, Netanyahu would risk jeopardizing his good ties with the president if he were to publicly oppose one of his administration’s key foreign policy initiatives.The last time Netanyahu crossed the temperamental Trump was when he congratulated Joe Biden for his election win in 2020. Trump was apparently offended by the perceived disloyalty, and their ties went into deep freeze.Israel is communicating to Washington its priorities for any deal. As part of that, it understood that should Israel choose to carry out a strike on Iran, it would likely be doing so alone — so long as negotiations were underway, according to an Israeli official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy.In a speech in Jerusalem this week, Netanyahu said he had discussed his terms for a deal with Trump. He explained that it would need to dismantle all the infrastructure of Iran\\'s nuclear program and that it should work to prevent Iran from developing ballistic missiles capable of delivering a bomb.\"I said to President Trump that I hope that this is what the negotiators will do. We’re in close contact with the United States. But I said one way or the other – Iran will not have nuclear weapons,” he said. Netanyahu has said he would favor a strict diplomatic agreement similar to Libya’s deal in 2003 to destroy its nuclear facilities and allow inspectors unfettered access. However, it is not clear if Trump will set such strict conditions — and Iran has rejected giving up its right to enrich. The Trump-led talks with Iran began earlier this month and have advanced to expert discussions over how to rein in Iran\\'s nuclear program and prevent it from being able to obtain atomic weapons, should it choose to pursue them. Iran says its program is for peaceful purposes, though some officials increasingly threaten to pursue the bomb. While Trump has said a military option remains on the table, and has moved military assets to the region, he says he prefers a diplomatic solution. Planned talks between Iran and the United States this weekend were postponed on Thursday.Since Trump scrapped the Obama-era agreement in 2018, Iran has ramped up its nuclear enrichment and increased its uranium stockpile.Netanyahu\\'s 2015 speech to Congress against Obama\\'s deal — at the invitation of Republicans — was made without consulting the White House. Obama did not attend.That was just one of many instances in which Netanyahu was seen as cozying up to Republicans, driving a wedge in what has traditionally been bipartisan support for Israel. That, coupled with Netanyahu\\'s strained relationship with the Biden administration over Israel\\'s conduct in Gaza, has meant that Netanyahu can\\'t rely on Democratic allies to take up his cause. Still, Netanyahu would struggle to find any Republicans willing to publicly confront the president on this issue. And he himself will struggle to criticize a deal if one is clinched; instead, he might send surrogates like his far-right allies to do so, said Gilboa of Bar-Ilan University.But until then, Gilboa said, Netanyahu\\'s best hope is that the talks fail.“That, for him, will be the best case scenario.”', 'location': 'ISR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Netanyahu muted on Iran deal due to Trump\\nENTITIES: Benjamin Netanyahu, Donald Trump, Iran, Israel\\nEVENT: Netanyahu is muted in his criticism of Iran's nuclear program due to his reliance on Trump's support, despite concerns about a new US-Iran deal.\\nCONTEXT: Netanyahu's silence reflects his dependence on Trump's support.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-02T16:09:34.237Z'}, {'id': 43129, 'sourceId': 12590, 'url': 'https://www.destructoid.com/all-high-art-event-pass-rewards-and-how-to-unlock-them-in-black-ops-6-and-warzone/#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=all-high-art-event-pass-rewards-and-how-to-unlock-them-in-black-ops-6-and-warzone', 'title': 'All High Art Event Pass rewards and how to unlock them in Black Ops 6 and Warzone', 'publishDate': '2025-05-01T21:40:00.000Z', 'content': \"Image via Activision\\nCategory:\\nWe're soaring and flying.\\nKristina Ebanez\\n|\\nPublished: May 1, 2025 04:40 pm\\nIf you loved Call of Duty’s entertaining High Trip mode, prepare for 2025’s take with High Art.

Given the celebration’s laid-back vibe, the delay feels pretty on-brand. The High Art event will start things off on May 1\\xa0with a wonderfully colorful extravaganza and a familiar face at the helm. The goal here is simple: rack up loads of XP to climb higher in High Art’s tiers—any mode works, whether you’re diving into Black Ops 6 Multiplayer, Zombies, or Warzone. As with most recent Event Pass systems, this celebration is split into two tracks: Free and Premium. The Premium Track is basically a dream come true for Seth Rogen fans, while the Free Track stays true to the 4/20 theme. Image via Activision You might want to break out those Double XP Tokens to blast through the event’s tiers at lightning speed. If we’re lucky, we could even get a whole weekend of leveling boosts. Some modes, like Kill Confirmed, Domination, and Hardpoint, are known for dishing out more XP than others. But if you’re craving something fresh, check out Season 3 Reloaded‘s limited-time modes, from BO6‘s Joint Operations to Warzone‘s Massive Resurgence.

The build removes the barrel, muzzle, and magazine to make room for its unique attachments. The result is increased splash damage, although it comes with a nerf to bullet velocity and fire rate. Image via Activision I’m also curious how the upcoming SMG, the Ladra, will change the meta. If it performs well, my trusty PP-919 loadout might finally be put to rest. But, out of all the event’s content, the Mastery reward is the real prize here. Operator skins usually come with a price tag, but this time you can earn one without spending a single COD Point. When does the High Art event end in BO6 and Warzone? You’ll have to earn all of High Art’s rewards before the event’s conclusion on May 15. That gives you more than two weeks to farm tons of XP, getting you closer to the Mastery rewards.

The announcement said that the Phitsanulok provincial prosecutor will request the provincial court to drop the charges and forward the case file and nonprosecution order to the commissioner of Provincial Police Region 6, covering Phitsanulok, who may review and contest the decision.Chambers, a 58-year-old Oklahoma native with a doctorate in political science from Northern Illinois University, was arrested in early April on a complaint made by the northern regional office of the army’s Internal Security Operations Command.He has studied the power and influence of the Thai military, which plays a major role in politics. It has staged 13 coups since Thailand became a constitutional monarchy in 1932, most recently 11 years ago.The army’s Internal Security Operations Command told a parliamentary inquiry that it filed the complaint based on a Facebook post that translated words from a website operated by ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute, a think tank in Singapore, about a webinar on Thai politics that included Chambers as a participant.Chambers’ supporters said that the blurb for the webinar, which was cited in his charge sheet as evidence, wasn't written by him.He had been jailed in April for two nights after reporting himself to the Phitsanulok police, and then granted release on bail, with several conditions, including wearing an ankle monitor. A court on Tuesday allowed him to take off the device.Chambers’ visa was revoked at the time of his arrest on the basis of an immigration law barring entry to foreigners who are deemed likely to engage in activities contrary to public order or good morals, prostitution, people smuggling and drug trafficking. It wasn't immediately clear whether the revocation will stand.“This case reinforces our longstanding concerns about the use of lèse majesté laws in Thailand,” a U.S. State Department statement said after Chambers' arrest. ”We continue to urge Thai authorities to respect freedom of expression and to ensure that laws are not used to stifle permitted expression.”Thailand’s lèse majesté law calls for three to 15 years imprisonment for anyone who defames, insults or threatens the king, the queen, the heir apparent or the regent. Critics say it's among the harshest such laws anywhere and also has been used to punish critics of the government and the military.The monarchy has long been considered a pillar of Thai society and criticizing it used to be strictly taboo. Conservative Thais, especially in the military and courts, still consider it untouchable.However, public debate on the topic has grown louder in the past decade, particularly among young people, and student-led pro-democracy protests starting in 2020 began openly criticizing the institution.That led to vigorous prosecutions under the previously little-used law. The legal aid group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights has said that since early 2020, more than 270 people — many of them student activists — have been charged with violating the law.\", 'location': 'THA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Thailand drops royal defamation case against scholar\\nENTITIES: Paul Chambers, Thailand, U.S. State Department, Thai Lawyers for Human Rights\\nEVENT: Thai prosecutors decided not to pursue royal defamation charges against U.S. scholar Paul Chambers, who was arrested for allegedly insulting the monarchy, but the case may still be reviewed by police.\\nCONTEXT: The case highlights concerns about Thailand's lèse majesté laws and their impact on freedom of expression.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-02T16:09:34.237Z'}, {'id': 40436, 'sourceId': 913, 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/02/climate-crisis-australia-federal-election-2025-coalition-labor', 'title': 'A climate election? The Coalition wants to take Australia backwards, while Labor is standing still', 'publishDate': '2025-05-02T04:12:21.000Z', 'content': 'If further confirmation was needed that the Peter Dutton-led Coalition would take Australia aggressively backwards on dealing with the climate crisis, his final election costings released on Thursday tell the story in black and white.The Liberal and National parties plan to gut programs designed to cut emissions and help create green industries to give the country an industrial future as demand for fossil fuels falls. They also plan to ignore advice that Australian nature is in poor and deteriorating health and strip back already limited funding for environment programs.On the evidence we have, they propose nothing to take their place. The sole climate-related idea on the table is a widely mocked plan to boost coal and gas-fired power for the next two decades and eventually build taxpayer-funded nuclear plants.\\nSign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter\\nThe Coalition optimistically claims two reactors could be in operation by the mid-2030s – an assertion based on a series of heroic assumptions, including that Dutton could pass legislation to lift a ban on nuclear energy in Australia and that reactors could be built faster and cheaper than has been possible in any comparable democracy. It’s a fantasy. Don’t believe me? Listen to the senior Coalition figures who have said so.Party’s climate and energy proposalsDutton’s argument that the country should have a serious discussion about whether nuclear energy should be part of Australia’s zero emissions arsenal might have carried more weight if he were not so determined to kill off all programs designed to set up a future climate response.The Coalition has promised to abolish tax credit programs to support the development of critical minerals, green hydrogen and green aluminium. It would cut tax breaks for electric vehicles and scrap a vehicle efficiency standard that requires auto companies to sell progressively cleaner cars. It would strip $1.7bn funding over the next four years from the Australian renewable energy agency, which provides grant funding for prospective clean technology. It would not back a Labor promise to drive a shift in electrification by subsidising home batteries.It would also slow the rollout of large-scale solar and windfarms and batteries, in part by axing the rewiring the nation program to fund new and strengthened electricity transmission connections. It would abolish the Net Zero Economy Agency created to help communities – particularly in areas that are home to fossil fuel industries – adjust to changes ahead.It’s possible some of these changes could be justified – not every government program is well targeted and rolled out. But to plan to dump them all, and offer nothing meaningful in their place, gives the game away.The Coalition claims to want Australia to reach net zero emissions by 2050, but you can’t get there by just building a few nuclear reactors after 2040 – assuming that is even possible. It will be a challenging task, socially, politically and logistically, and demands a holistic plan to drive and harness changing practices across the economy and country.Dutton pretends it will just happen. There is no evidence-based world in which this should be taken seriously.It is not a given that Liberal-National governments have an anti-climate action platform. In NSW, a Coalition government introduced a nation-leading policy to underwrite and expand renewable energy that passed in 2020 with support from Labor and the Greens and was widely applauded. We can only imagine what might be possible if this cooperation happened nationally.The federal Coalition’s position – backed by some of the country’s biggest media companies – has many side effects. Probably the biggest is that it keeps the centre of national debate away from the serious conversations that need to be had about the future.Labor, still scarred by years of largely baseless scare campaigns suggesting doing anything on climate would wreck the economy, has done little more than stand still on climate at this election. It has released only one policy of note – the 30% subsidy for batteries for households and small businesses. Anthony Albanese also announced that if re-elected he hoped to host a “Pacific Cop” climate summit in Adelaide next year.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionBut the big questions it will need to grapple with if re-elected have been ignored in campaign debate.Labor plans to set a 2035 emissions reduction target by September. Preliminary advice from the Climate Change Authority, now chaired by former NSW Liberal minister Matt Kean, has suggested a range of 65%-75% below 2005 levels would be achievable.The target’s announcement will be a big moment in setting the course of the economy for the next decade, and will demand new policies to meet it. The debate is likely to also lead to more thorny conversations about the future of Australia’s fossil fuel exports, which continue to increase. That these issues were not considered worthy of discussion in four televised leaders’ debates during the campaign is pretty extraordinary, to put it mildly.While it hasn’t said much about it, the Albanese government was working before the election on a net zero plan, sector-by-sector economy decarbonisation plans and a domestically focused national climate risk assessment and an adaptation plan. It is also sitting on a long-finished report assessing the security risks related to the climate crisis.These issues cannot be pushed aside for ever. Depending on where things end up after Saturday, a big part of the push for them to be properly addressed is likely to come from the parliamentary cross bench – the Greens and community-backed independents.Having surprised nearly everyone with its historic surge at the 2022 election, famously increasing from 6 to 16 lower house MPs, it’s possible the cross bench doesn’t expand much this time, or even goes backwards. Many of the seats are tight contests.But with the Climate 200 fundraising body having identified 35 campaigns as worthy of support, including in regional electorates where independents came from nowhere to nearly win last time, there is also a scenario in which a shift away from the established big parties becomes even more entrenched.If that happens, it will mostly be towards individuals who want more focus on the issue, not less.

Kennedy Jr. In addition, it directs a search of communications for a long list of keywords, including “Pepe the Frog,” “incel,” “q-anon,” “Black Lives Matter,” “great replacement theory,” “far-right,” and “infodemic.” For several people who received or saw the document, the broad requests for unredacted information felt like a “witch hunt,” one official says—one that could put the privacy and security of numerous individuals and organizations at risk.\\nBeattie, whom Trump appointed in February to be the acting undersecretary for public diplomacy, told State Department officials that his goal in seeking these records was a “Twitter files”-like release of internal State Department documents “to rebuild trust with the American public,” according to a State Department employee who heard the remarks. (Beattie was referring to the internal Twitter documents that were released after Elon Musk bought the platform, in an attempt to prove that the company had previously silenced conservatives. While the effort provided more detail on the challenges and mistakes Twitter had already admitted to, it failed to produce a smoking gun.) “What would be the innocent reason for doing that?” Bill Kristol The document, dated March 11, 2025, focuses specifically on records and communications from the Counter Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (R/FIMI) Hub, a small office in the State Department’s Office of Public Diplomacy that tracked and countered foreign disinformation campaigns; it was created after the Global Engagement Center (GEC), which had the same mission, shut down at the end of 2024. MIT Technology Review broke the news earlier this month that R/FIMI would be shuttered.\\nSome R/FIMI staff were at the meeting where the document was initially shared, as were State Department lawyers and staff from the department’s Bureau of Administration, who are responsible for conducting searches to fulfill public records requests.\\xa0 Also included among the nearly 60 individuals and organizations caught up in Beattie’s information dragnet are Bill Gates; the open-source journalism outlet Bellingcat; former FBI special agent Clint Watts; Nancy Faeser, the German interior minister; Daniel Fried, a career State Department official and former US ambassador to Poland; Renée DiResta, an expert in online disinformation who led research at Stanford Internet Observatory; and Nina Jankowicz, a disinformation researcher who briefly led the Disinformation Governance Board at the US Department of Homeland Security.

When told of their inclusion in the records request, multiple people expressed alarm that such a list exists at all in an American institution. “When I was in government I’d never done anything like that,” Kristol, a former chief of staff to Vice President Dan Quayle, says. “What would be the innocent reason for doing that?” Fried echoes this sentiment. “I spent 40 years in the State Department, and you didn’t collect names or demand email records,” says Fried. “I’ve never heard of such a thing”—at least not in the American context, he clarifies. It did remind him of Eastern European “Communist Party minder[s] watching over the untrusted bureaucracy.”\\xa0 He adds: “It also approaches the compilation of an enemies list.”\\xa0 Targeting the “censorship industrial complex” Both GEC and R/FIMI, its pared-down successor office, focused on tracking and countering foreign disinformation efforts from Russia, China, and Iran, among others, but GEC was frequently accused—and was even sued—by conservative critics who claimed that it enabled censorship of conservative Americans’ views. A judge threw out one of those claims against GEC in 2022 (while finding that other parts of the Biden administration did exert undue pressure on tech platforms).\\xa0 Beattie has also personally promoted these views. Before joining the State Department, he started Revolver News, a website that espouses far-right talking points that often gain traction in certain conservative circles. Among the ideas promoted in Revolver News is that GEC was part of a “censorship industrial complex” aimed at suppressing American conservative voices, even though GEC’s mission was foreign disinformation. This idea has taken hold more broadly; the House Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing titled the “Censorship-Industrial Complex: The Need for First Amendment Safeguards at the State Department,” on April 1 focused on GEC.\\xa0 Most people on the list appear to have focused at some point on tracking or challenging disinformation broadly, or on countering specific false claims, including those related to the 2020 election. A few of the individuals appear primarily to be critics of Trump, Beattie, or others in the right-wing media ecosystem. Many have been the subject of Trump’s public grievances for years. (Trump called Krebs, for instance, a “significant bad-faith actor” in an executive order targeting him earlier this month.)\\nBeattie specifically asked for “all documents, emails, correspondence, or other records of communications amongst/between employees, contractors, subcontractors or consultants at the GEC or R/FIMI” since 2017 with all the named individuals, as well as communications that merely referenced them. He sought communications that referenced any of the listed organizations.\\xa0\\xa0 Finally, he sought a list of additional unredacted agency records—including all GEC grants and contracts, as well as subgrants, which are particularly sensitive due to the risks of retaliation to subgrantees, who often work in local journalism, fact-checking, or pro-democracy organizations under repressive regimes. It also asked for “all documents mentioning” the Election Integrity Partnership, a research collaboration between academics and tech companies that has been a target of right-wing criticism.\\xa0 Several State Department staffers call the records requests “unusual” and “improper” in their scope. MIT Technology Review spoke to three people who had personally seen the document, as well as two others who were aware of it; we agreed to allow them to speak anonymously due to their fears of retaliation.\\xa0 While they acknowledge that previous political appointees have, on occasion, made information requests through the records management system, Beattie’s request was something wholly different.\\xa0 Never had “an incoming political appointee” sought to “search through seven years’ worth of all staff emails to see whether anything negative had been said about his friends,” says one staffer.\\xa0 Another staffer calls it a “pet project” for Beattie.\\xa0 Selective transparency Beattie delivered the request, which he framed as a “transparency” initiative, to the State Department officials in a conference room at its Washington, D.C., headquarters on a Tuesday afternoon in early March, in the form of an 11-page packet titled, “SO [Senior Official] Beattie Inquiry for GEC/R/FIMI Records.” The documents were printed out, rather than emailed. Labeled “sensitive but unclassified,” the document lays out Beattie’s requests in 12 separate, but sometimes repetitive, bullet points. In total, he sought communications about 16 organizations, including Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center and the US Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), as well as with and about 39 individuals.\\nNotably, this includes several journalists: In addition to Bellingcat and Applebaum, the document also asks for communications with NBC News senior reporter Brandy Zadrozny.\\xa0 Press-freedom advocates expressed alarm about the inclusion of journalists on the list, as well as the possibility of their communications being released to the public, which goes “considerably well beyond the scope of what … leak investigations in the past have typically focused on,” says Grayson Clary, a staff attorney at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. Rather, the effort seems like “a tactic designed to … make it much harder for journalists to strike up those source relationships in the first instance.”\\nBeattie also requested a search for communications that mentioned Trump and more than a dozen other prominent right-leaning figures. In addition to Jones, Greenwald, and “RFK Jr.,” the list includes “Don Jr.,” Elon Musk, Joe Rogan, Charlie Kirk, Marine Le Pen, “Bolsonaro” (which could cover either Jair Bolsonaro, the former Brazilian president, or his son Eduardo, who is seeking political asylum in the US), and Beattie himself. It also asked for a search for 32 right-wing buzzwords related to abortion, immigration, election denial, and January 6, suggesting a determined effort to find State Department staff who even just discussed such matters.\\xa0 (Staffers say they doubt that Beattie will find much, unless, one says, it’s “previous [FOIA] queries from people like Beattie” or discussions about “some Russian or PRC [Chinese] narrative that includes some of this stuff.”) Multiple sources say State Department employees raised alarms internally about the records requests. They worried about the sensitivity and impropriety of the broad scope of the information requested, particularly because records would be unredacted, as well as about how the search would be conducted: through the eRecords file management system, which makes it easy for administrative staff to search through and retrieve State Department employees’ emails, typically in response to FOIA requests.\\xa0 This felt, they say, like a powerful misuse of the public records system—or as Jankowicz, the disinformation researcher and former DHS official, put it, “weaponizing the access [Beattie] has to internal communications in order to upend people’s lives.” “It stank to high heaven,” one staffer says. “This could be used for retaliation. This could be used for any kind of improper purposes, and our oversight committees should be informed of this.” Another employee expressed concerns about the request for information on the agency’s subgrantees—who were often on the ground in repressive countries and whose information was closely guarded and not shared digitally, unlike the public lists of contractors and grantees typically available on websites like Grants.gov or USAspending.gov. “Making it known that [they] took money from the United States would put a target on them,” this individual explains. “We kept that information very secure. We wouldn’t even email subgrant names back and forth.”\\nSeveral people familiar with the matter say that by early April, Beattie had received many of the documents he’d requested, retrieved through eRecords, as well as a list of grantees. One source says the more sensitive list of subgrantees was not shared.\\xa0\\xa0 Neither the State Department nor Beattie responded to requests for comment. A CISA spokesperson emailed, “We do not comment on intergovernmental documents and would refer you back to the State Department.” We reached out to all individuals whose communications were requested and are named here; many declined to comment on the record. A “chilling effect” Five weeks after Beattie made his requests for information, the State Department shut down R/FIMI.\\xa0 An hour after staff members were informed, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio published a blog post announcing the news on the Federalist, one of the outlets that sued the GEC over allegations of censorship. He then discussed in an interview with the influential right-wing Internet personality Mike Benz plans for Beattie to lead a “transparency effort.”\\n“What we have to do now—and Darren will be big involved in that as well—is sort of document what happened … because I think people who were harmed deserve to know that, and be able to prove that they were harmed,” Rubio told Benz. This is what Beattie—and Benz—have long called for. Many of the names and keywords he included in his request reflect conspiracy theories and grievances promoted by Revolver News—which Beattie founded after being fired from his job as a speechwriter during the first Trump administration when CNN reported that he had spoken at a conference with white nationalists.\\xa0 Ultimately, the State Department staffers say they fear that a selective disclosure of documents, taken out of context, could be distorted to fit any kind of narrative Beattie, Rubio, or others create.\\xa0 Weaponizing any speech they consider to be critical by deeming it disinformation is not only ironic, says Jankowicz—it will also have “chilling effects” on anyone who conducts disinformation research, and it will result in “less oversight and transparency over tech platforms, over adversarial activities, over, frankly, people who are legitimately trying to disenfranchise US voters.”\\xa0 That, she warns, “is something we should all be alarmed about.”', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: State Dept.

We’ll say things in the dressing room and that is in the dressing room. It should stay there.“Then we come out in the press and we’ll say an off-the-cuff one-liner that maybe a group of lads have been talking about, it’s in the press, then it looks like we’re ‘Billy Big Boots’, above our station.“I don’t particularly like that. We’ve got to be respectful. (But) I’m not kicking off at the other players.” England cricketers have also faced criticism for being more concerned about their golf game than the day job, with former captain Kevin Pietersen unhappy with the side’s approach during a woeful white-ball tour of India where they won once in eight games.But Wood hit back at suggestions England are not training hard enough. “One thing that does bother me is this narrative of ‘Golf, golf, golf’,” said the 35-year-old.“I don’t play golf. I don’t like it. It’s not a game for me. I know the lads enjoy it and that’s their time off. At times it’s as if the golf is more important, and that is not true at all.

Zepbound will be excluded.This could complicate access to a drug that many patients cannot afford to pay for on their own. The formulary is maintained by CVS Health’s pharmacy benefits management business, which runs prescription drug coverage for millions of people. Employers and insurers — who pay most of the prescription bill — use the formulary to decide which drugs get coverage.They can customize their coverage plans to include Zepbound. But CVS Health spokesman David Whitrap said most employers wind up using the standard formulary because of the discounts negotiated for them.Patients taking Zepbound will be able to switch to Wegovy if the Lilly drug is excluded from their coverage, Whitrap said.CVS Health also said Thursday that it will start selling Wegovy at a discounted price of about $500 monthly at thousands of drugstores for people without coverage. Novo had announced its new lower price last month.Wegovy and Zepbound are part of a wave of obesity medications known as GLP-1 receptor agonists that have soared in popularity due to the amount of weight people lose while taking the injections. Coverage of these drugs has been patchy due to in part to their cost and the wide swath of patients who could take them.Shortages of the drugs also have made access challenging, but those have eased recently. That allows pharmacy benefit managers to pit the products against each other to negotiate lower prices in exchange for inclusion on a formulary.Lilly may have to make some price cuts to restore formulary access, said Daniel Barasa, who follows the company for Gabelli Funds. But he said he thinks big employers will still include both treatments on their lists of covered drugs, leaving the choice on what to use up to patients and doctors.Lilly said late last year that a head-to-head study of the two drugs showed that Zepbound helped patients drop more pounds.Zepbound has emerged as one of Lilly's top sellers. Its sales jumped to $2.3 billion in the recently completed first quarter. That’s up from $517 million a year ago, during the drug’s first full quarter on the market.Lilly shares shed more than $90 in value, falling nearly 11% to $804.06 Thursday afternoon.

The two major parties are more fearful of the results tonight than we are.”Early results showed Reform making inroads at the expense of Labour in Northumberland, the only council counting in full overnight.Reform’s deputy leader Richard Tice said the party was also “absolutely smashing it” in traditionally Conservative Lincolnshire, where Dame Andrea Jenkyns – a former Tory minister – is on course to win the regional mayoral contest.He said the Runcorn and Helsby by-election was “very, very close, nip-and-tuck, way too close to call”, but underlined how remarkable that was in a formerly safe Labour seat.He told Sky News there was a “seismic shift going on tonight in British politics, where Reform is is taking huge chunks of votes and seats from both the two main parties”.Labour Party chairwoman Ellie Reeves said the elections “were always going to be a challenge” for her party because they were largely in areas “dominated by the Conservatives, often for decades”.She acknowledged voters “aren’t yet fully feeling the benefit” of changes brought in since Sir Keir took office.“However the results turn out this evening, this Labour government will go further and faster in turning our country around and giving Britain the future it deserves,” she said.But there was some good news for Labour as the party held the North Tyneside mayoralty, although with a majority of just 444 ahead of Reform in second place.Conservative frontbencher Helen Whately said “we know we’re going to have a really hard night” because 2021 was a “high watermark” for the Conservatives.The shadow work and pensions secretary told BBC’s Newsnight: “We’re going to get a real battering in these elections.”(PA Graphics)PA GraphicsLib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said Mrs Badenoch faced “a reckoning at the ballot box”.He said: “We are expecting to see big gains against the Conservatives in their former Middle England heartlands.”The Green Party was also hoping for success in local contests, with co-leader Carla Denyer saying: “We are taking seats from both the Conservatives and Labour up and down the country as voters, understandably, move away from the tired old parties that have let us all down.”', 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: UK elections test two-party system; Reform surge\\nENTITIES: Nigel Farage, Reform UK, Labour, Conservatives, Liberal Democrats, Greens, Keir Starmer, Kemi Badenoch\\nEVENT: Votes are being counted in UK local and mayoral elections, including a by-election in Runcorn and Helsby.

A man working on a laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)INSURANCE DATA BREACH EXPOSES SENSITIVE INFO OF 1.6 MILLION PEOPLEThe reality check: Why manual removal becomes overwhelming fastIf you want to remove your information from all (or most) of the data brokers that have it, here’s what you’ll have to do.Find the brokers that have your data. There are hundreds out there. You can find the public-facing data brokers, or people-search sites, by doing a quick Google search. However, private data brokers that sell datasets B2B (business-to-business) require a little more digging. You may have to just figure out which ones operate in your area and send removal requests to them all.Submit opt-out requests to each one. Read through their opt-out instructions (some of which are intentionally vague or buried) and go through the process one by one.Repeat the process periodically. Data brokers often re-collect your info unless you keep checking in and submitting new requests. It’s not a one-and-done situation. If you’re committed to keeping your data private, you’ll need to keep monitoring and removing it.It’s definitely doable, but not painless. Some sites make it easier, but others require you to upload your ID (not recommended), ask you to send snail mail or outright reject your request unless you use a specific email domain, not to mention all the CAPTCHAs that feel like they were designed to break your spirit.WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? A woman working on her laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)HOW TO GET RID OF ROBOCALLS WITH APPS AND DATA REMOVAL SERVICES\\xa0Data removal services automate this processI’ve since tried using a data removal service that automates the opt-out process, handling the complexities on your behalf. See below for what this gives you.Comprehensive coverage: They maintain updated lists of data brokers and their opt-out procedures, so your information is removed from more sources than you’d manage on your own.Time efficiency: Because most of them use automation, you don’t really have to do anything beyond signing up and monitoring the progress. This saves you significant time and effort.\\u200bOngoing removals: As long as you’re subscribed, these services continue to monitor and remove your information from data broker sites, so you know it won’t pop up again.\\u200bI didn’t have to babysit the process, and I didn’t have to guess whether it was working. I just got updates when the removals were confirmed.GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERELet’s break it downIf you’re still weighing your options, here’s how the two approaches stack up.Manual opt-outs demand a significant time investment, requiring you to personally navigate each data broker’s unique removal process. While free, this approach offers variable coverage depending on how diligently you track down brokers, and consistency is challenging; you’ll need to repeat the process regularly to keep your data private. Success also depends heavily on your ability to decipher vague opt-out instructions and adapt to each broker’s requirements.In contrast, data removal services save time by handling the legwork for you. They provide broad coverage by targeting numerous brokers simultaneously and maintain consistency through ongoing monitoring. While these services come with subscription fees, they eliminate the need for personal expertise, offering a hands-off solution to data privacy.The bottom line: Why personal data removal services win the privacy battleAfter testing both manual opt-outs and automated services, using a personal data removal service emerges as the clear solution for reclaiming your data. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\\xa0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.Kurt’s key takeawaysIf you’ve got the time and patience, you can absolutely take the DIY route. But if you’re looking for a way to protect your privacy without sinking hours into research, filling out forms and monitoring, a data removal service makes things a lot quicker and more convenient. For most people, this is likely the better option. Many states have privacy laws that give you the right to request that data brokers remove your personal information, but the system seems to be rigged to make exercising those rights unreasonably difficult.\\xa0While it shouldn’t be necessary, data removal services offer a way to cheat that system.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPDo you think stronger protections are needed to shield you from the challenges and risks posed by data brokers and their handling of your personal information?

They can be decided by differences in proportion so small that, if the election had been held in a crowded barn and people had shouted out a voice vote, you would have had no idea who won, and yet even the tiniest margins become signals of historical inevitability. As with our most recent Presidential election, a small squeeze is amplified into an immense triumph. This is, of course, why we have elections not by voice vote but by voting booth—and, in Canada, by secure, old-fashioned paper ballots. In the Canadian federal election on Monday, the Liberal Party, led by the economist and banker Mark Carney—who had taken over the Prime Ministership in March, following the resignation, after a decade in power, of Justin Trudeau—won about forty-four per cent of the popular vote. The Conservatives, led by the right-wing populist Pierre Poilievre, came in second, with about forty-one per cent, and so Carney and his party will form a minority government in Canada’s British-style Parliament, needing help from the third and fourth parties—the Francophone nationalist Bloc Québécois and the social-democratic New Democratic Party—to pass legislation, but with a clear edge in seats.It was a close election, but, for once, an uncomplicated result with real meaning. As recently as January, the Liberals trailed the Conservatives by almost twenty points in the polls, owing to a wave of severe, if sometimes incoherent, dissatisfaction with Trudeau. Carney, a ridiculously accomplished technocrat, who has been the head of both the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada, turned this around, and he did it exclusively because Donald Trump had threatened Canada, and Carney seemed a better barrier—in plain English, a better general to rally the country—than the unduly Trumpite Poilievre.Poilievre can point to a better result for the Conservatives than in the previous election, and might therefore keep his leadership; on the other hand, he lost his own seat in Parliament, in a usually reliably Conservative riding in Ottawa, a personal repudiation that suggests that he is simply not a seductive politician. Originally from Alberta, he has led the Party only since 2022, and his public support for the truckers’ occupation of Ottawa to protest COVID restrictions, though popular with a part of his base, frightened many Canadians with its implicit Trumpian extremism. As a Conservative political lieutenant in Quebec and ex-M.P. who recently quit the Party remarked, Poilievre, when it seemed advantageous, adopted a very Trumpy and, for Canada, very atypical brand. “The party uses the same recipes as Trump: The anger, the rage that people have against the system, it feeds it and uses intellectual shortcuts that, in my eyes, do no honor to the [political] profession. The attacks on social media, the half-truths,” he noted, “We’re looking at all costs for the 30-second extract that will go viral, to feed the base.”One can look around and find Canadian peculiarities in the election results: the Western provinces are still hostile to the Liberal Party, but Quebec, its historic base, has, after some electoral flirtations elsewhere, once again embraced it. (The historic role of the Liberal Party, particularly under the Prime Ministership of Justin Trudeau’s imposing father, Pierre Trudeau, has been to keep Quebec within confederation—a role at which it has been astonishingly successful.) Meanwhile, the N.D.P., the social-democratic party, which has deep and distinguished roots in Western Canada, was almost extinguished, in part because the progressive vote migrated to the Liberals. Like Poilievre, Jagmeet Singh, the N.D.P.’s leader, was defeated in his own riding; he has since stepped down from his party’s leadership. And, of course, Canada being Canada, the CBC, in the midst of its election-night coverage, headlined the sad news that the curling team of Peterman and Gallant had been defeated, in the strangest of all national sports, in a bonspiel at the mixed-doubles world championships—right there, alongside the election.But the election was won and lost on Trumpism and its perils. Many Americans don’t take Trump’s threats to Canada seriously—or seriously enough—and dismiss them with the same exhausted shrug that too many of Trump’s words inspire. We hear the repetitive ribbon of talk about annexation and the fifty-first state, and when we do we hear clownish trolling. In Canada, he doesn’t sound like a troll. He sounds like a threat. Trump’s interest in annexation, and his claim of some right to do it—the Canadian border is “just an artificial line”—is clear, and, though he does not (yet) use the language of military conquest, what other form could annexation of a neighboring country that doesn’t want to be annexed take? It is significant, as with Greenland, that, though the threat is only implicit, it is always implicit. In his rants about annexing Canada, Trump does not add “if they want it” or “if only they would hold a referendum on joining our union,” or use language showing respect for the country’s history and sovereignty, or say anything that would suggest, to not overly paranoid Canadian ears, that he intends a courtship, not a conflict. Instead he speaks the language of power and domination, the Putinist language directed at Ukraine before the war: your land should be ours and will be soon. It seems absurd to have to recall, but we should, that conducting aggressive warfare against unoffending states is what the United States, after the Second World War, defined as a crime during the Nuremberg Trials, stating that to initiate a war of aggression “is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime.”One also hardly needs to illustrate, as the last in a long line of more expert explainers, why the whole notion of Canada treating the U.S. “unfairly” in trade, the ostensible reason for the assaults on what used to be our beloved neighbor to the north, is also absurd. One can cite and correct particular details about this fiction: for instance, essentially the sole cause of the trade deficit is Canadian crude oil sent from Canada to fuel the United States, something that is clearly in America’s interest. But even to make this argument is to get trapped in the absurdity of the belief that trade deficits are noxious, when they are not—no more, to use a standard but helpful analogy, than the fact that I spend more at the supermarket across the street than it spends on me shows that the supermarket is exploiting my family. The deficit is in my interest: I give them money; they give me onions. We could grow our own onions, but it seems simpler to buy them across the street. And, in any case, Canada couldn’t become the “Fifty First State” even if it wanted to, because Canada isn’t one “state” but many provinces and regions and peoples, each with passionate histories and interests of their own.Canada’s history is a beautiful one of decisive compromise and coalition building, those distinct if unglamorous liberal virtues. This is why Carney’s acceptance speech on Monday night—“victory speech” would be an inopportune phrase, as it didn’t have that tone—was in so many ways ominous and foreboding and unprecedented in Canadian history. One would have expected him to tiptoe around the issue of Trump’s aggression or, on a night of triumph, to paint a happier or conciliatory face on it. He didn’t. “As I’ve been warning for months, America wants our land, our resources, our water, our country,” Carney said, bluntly. “These are not idle threats. President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us.\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0. That will never, ever happen.” Immediately, Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission, congratulated Carney and said, pointedly, that “the bond between Europe and Canada is strong—and growing stronger.\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0. We’ll defend our shared democratic values.”It would be one of the stranger, if in a way more inspiring, ironies of our time if what is happening in America ends by stiffening the sinews and strengthening the ties between the remaining liberal democracies. It feels absurd to have to write that sentence.

It is toward the end of Mr. Bhatt’s nearly 40-second ride down the zip line that he starts to look around, realizing something is wrong.“For about 20 seconds I did not realize; I was deep in my fun in the zip line,” he said in an interview with India Today, a leading mainstream Indian news channel. “Then I realized that firing was going on and people were dying below, and I saw five or six people had been shot.” After he got off the zip line, Mr. Bhatt said he found his family, and they fled, managing to escape the attack unharmed.A lot remains unclear about last week’s terror attack that took more than 26 lives and injured 17 people. It has escalated tensions between India and Pakistan, the neighbor that India accuses of supporting terrorism, to the verge of military confrontation.Mr. Bhatt’s video has gone viral in India, becoming one piece of evidence as investigators piece together the details of the security lapse and what happened as a picturesque day turned into one of horror.Suhasini Raj is a reporter based in New Delhi who has covered India for The Times since 2014.Mujib Mashal is the South Asia bureau chief for The Times, helping to lead coverage of India and the diverse region around it, including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bhutan.Jiawei Wang is\\xa0a video journalist for The New York Times based in Seoul.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT', 'location': 'IND', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Tourist video captures Kashmir terror attack\\nENTITIES: Rishi Bhatt, Kashmir, India, Pakistan\\nEVENT: Militants opened fire on tourists in Kashmir's Baisaran Valley, killing over two dozen people.

Gavin Newsom signed a law in 2022 removing a requirement for police, highway patrol, and corrections officers in the state to be U.S. citizens or permanent residents.\\nNow, a foreign national Felipe Gomes, who was hired by the Belmont Police Department after the law went into effect in 2023, was arrested last week on suspicion of rape, The Blaze reported. The Brazilian national was reportedly hired despite a previous arrest in 2017 for domestic violence.\\nRedwood City Police arrested Gomes at the Belmont Police Department headquarters on April 22, RCPD Sgt. Victor Figueroa said. Gomes is accused of violating penal code 261 (a)(1), which is “knowingly having sexual intercourse with an\\xa0individual incapable of giving consent because of a mental disorder or developmental or physical disability,” according to the report.\\nGomes was subsequently booked into the San Mateo County Office Main Jail and released on $100,000 bond. Belmont Police Lt. Pete Lotti said Gomes was terminated the day after his arrest, the report states.\\nGomes was sworn in on Dec. 10 at a Belmont City Council ceremony. At the ceremony, Belmont Police Chief Ken Stenquist said Gomes was in the Brazilian Air Force and worked as air force police.\\n“He was a full-time police soldier and left that position when he moved to the United States. He enjoys practicing jiu jitsu and attending church when he’s not working,” Stenquist added.\\nThe San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office and the East Palo Alto Police Department allegedly warned Chief Stenquist about Gomes before he was hired. Both law enforcement agencies said they had rejected his application due to a 2017 domestic violence arrest, KGO-TV reported.\\n“The charging affidavit reviewed by KGO alleged that one year into his marriage, Gomes — who is not an American citizen but apparently has a U.S. work permit — brutally beat his wife, striking her repeatedly in the face and stomach. Gomes had allegedly done so after seeing text messages on his wife’s phone from her ex-boyfriend,” according to the report.\\nAn officer at the time said he saw a “large bruise that covered most of (his wife’s) left cheek and scratches to her right cheek.”\\n“The state attorney reportedly factored in Gomes’ claims that his wife hit and scratched him first, charged both husband and wife with battery/domestic violence, and ultimately dropped the charges,” the report details.\\nChief Stenquist told the outlet that “past law enforcement contact that does not result in charges are not disqualifying in of itself under policies or applicable law.”\\nFormer San Francisco Police Department commander and head of recruitment Rich Corriea countered that while charges are often dropped in such cases, the incident should still disqualify Gomes from being a police officer.\\n“You don’t want someone who in a family setting, you know, violence is a place they can escalate to,” Corriea told the outlet. “You want just the opposite. You want natural de-escalators.”\\nCorreia also suggested that hiring foreign nationals for law enforcement work can be risky because such individuals may not completely understand how the American justice system works.\\n“You better make sure that you… are hiring people that get the many nuances of the role of a police officer,” Corriea said. “There’s no one else, as far as I know, in our entire society that carries a gun and has the authority to shoot you under certain circumstances.”\\nGomes is expected to appear at the San Mateo County Superior Court on May 21 for an arraignment.', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Non-citizen cop arrested after law change\\nENTITIES: Gavin Newsom, Felipe Gomes, Belmont Police Department, Ken Stenquist, Rich Corriea, San Mateo County\\nEVENT: Non-citizen police officer arrested for rape after prior domestic violence arrest.

From now on, you’ll be able to see when image Pins that appear in your feed have been either generated or modified using AI. When users click on an image Pin in close-up they’ll see an “AI modified” label in the bottom left-hand corner.In a blog post published this week, Pinterest says it has been testing the new feature for several months, which involves analysing the metadata of an image to assess its source. It says it’s also developing classifiers that can automatically detect the whiff of generative AI even when metadata markers are absent. How successful it is in doing so will become clear as the new features roll out globally, and creators who suspect their content has been mislabelled will be able to appeal.Such mislabelling has been an ongoing issue for Meta, which was forced to adjust the wording of the AI labels it applied to uploaded photos on Facebook and Instagram after photographers complained they were being added to images that hadn’t been created using AI. Apparently, even minimal use of the generative fill tool in Photoshop was enough to trigger a label. That’s something that Pinterest will likely want to look out for as it hones this new algorithm.In addition to the new labels, Pinterest says it’s experimenting with a feature that would allow users to filter out categories where AI modification or generation is particularly prevalent, such as beauty and art.

More than 100 people had been taken into custody by federal immigration agents, and Colorado Springs’s mayor, Yemi Mobolade, had a decision to make.Law enforcement officials said their operation in the Sunday morning darkness cleared out a club that was rife with drugs, guns and prostitution. Liberal voters who helped elect Mr. Mobolade, a Nigerian-born pastor and political independent, to lead their historically conservative city were disturbed by the mass arrest of so many immigrants.Mr. Mobolade made his choice.“This immigrant mayor says, if you’re here illegally and you’re committing a crime, there should be consequences,” he said in an interview. “You should be deported.”The raid, led by the Drug Enforcement Administration, came the week after a large-scale operation in Florida that led to the arrests of more than 1,100 people. But this one was conducted in Democratic Colorado, in an increasingly purple city, Colorado’s second largest. The aftermath of the raid reflects the deep divisions over President Trump’s mass deportation efforts.Mr. Mobolade and other mayors in Colorado, New York and Massachusetts have faced frustration and criticism from voters over their response to record-breaking migrant arrivals under President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Now they face a backlash from the left, as the Trump administration steps up its immigration crackdown and presses local officials to cooperate.Some of Mr. Mobolade’s left-leaning voters felt betrayed by the raid. The arrests and a lack of information about what had become of the detainees unnerved many immigrants. What’s more, the city of Colorado Springs had participated by sending about 50 police officers to assist federal agents.On Tuesday, about 30 people protested outside the local sheriff’s office, waving banners that condemned Immigration and Customs Enforcement and shouting, “Immigrants are welcome here!”“These raids are not about public safety,” said Brandon Rincon, an organizer with the Colorado Springs Peoples Coalition. “These are terror attacks on our community.”ImageThe Colorado Springs nightclub that was raided operated after midnight on weekends in a mostly vacant strip mall. Credit...Daniel Brenner for The New York TimesBut Mr. Mobolade, who first came to the United States on a student visa, said he saw a clear difference between immigrants who came to the United States to work and the people who were scooped up and put on buses Sunday.“I know there’s a bigger immigration story going on, but this is about criminal behavior,” he said.Mr. Mobolade’s election as mayor in 2023 captured the changing character of Colorado Springs, a city of 490,000 at the base of Pikes Peak, where large military bases and the headquarters of the Christian conservative organization Focus on the Family helped forge a culture on the political right.An influx of liberal and moderate voters who have been priced out of Denver and Boulder has nudged the city toward the center, while the rest of Colorado has moved sharply left. Mr. Mobolade, a political newcomer, beat an establishment Republican to become the first Black mayor of a city whose population is roughly two-thirds white, and its first non-Republican mayor in more than 40 years.His winning message: unity.Still, the 46-year-old mayor has found it hard to escape the country’s culture wars, as he tried to help Colorado Springs recover from a 2022 mass shooting at an L.G.B.T.Q. nightclub, and to focus on bread-and-butter issues such as reducing homelessness and keeping the U.S. Space Command headquarters in town.Mr. Trump’s political comeback has had an impact. Mr. Mobolade said he had stopped describing the city as “inclusive” because of the battles over diversity, equity and inclusion. In the interview in his sixth-floor office, between meetings on public safety and summertime parks events, he wondered whether it was now polarizing even to call his city “welcoming.” “We’re forced to deal with the national chaos and conversation around identity politics,” he said. Some neighbors living near the raided nightclub praised law enforcement for helping to clean up what they called a rough corner of town. Several of them called the D.E.A.’s Denver field office to leave grateful voice mail messages, officials said. “Does my heart good to know somebody’s looking after my safety,” one man is heard to say.Jonathan Pullen, the special agent in charge of the D.E.A.’s Rocky Mountain Field Division, described the nightclub, known as Warike, as a “den of iniquity.” It opened at 2 a.m. on weekends and drew a largely Latino clientele who learned of the club through Spanish-language posts on social media and word of mouth.“Everything about it is illegal,” Mr. Pullen said in an interview.ImageProtesters outside the El Paso County sheriff’s office in Colorado Springs said the nightclub raid was intended to terrorize immigrants.Credit...Daniel Brenner for The New York TimesAt the time of the raid, the club was operating in a mostly vacant strip mall, near a Mexican restaurant and a Hispanic market. The club had bounced from location to location, law enforcement officers said. A man who appeared to be the club’s landlord declined on Thursday to comment, and the club’s management could not be reached.The D.E.A. began investigating the club earlier this year, and determined through undercover operations and surveillance that dealers inside were selling drugs. The raid found meth and a pink-dyed recreational drug known as tusi that often contains a mix of ketamine and other drugs, officials said. In mid-April, agents saw two patrons pointing guns out of their car windows and shooting into the air as they drove around outside the club, Mr. Pullen said.Early on Sunday, agents from the D.E.A. and 10 other federal agencies surrounded the building and issued a bilingual order for the roughly 200 people inside to come out with their hands up. Photos and video posted online by the D.E.A. show patrons in sheer shirts, high-heel boots, and in one case a hot-pink suit, surrendering to agents in helmets and tactical vests.Federal officials said they had detained 114 people from countries including Mexico, Cuba, El Salvador and Venezuela. An ICE spokesman did not respond to a message asking how many of the detainees remained in custody on Thursday, or whether they would face deportation proceedings.Mr. Pullen said the raid was primarily part of a drug investigation, not an immigration raid, and that the investigation was continuing. But he said federal agents had a duty to apprehend undocumented immigrants when they encountered them during an investigation.“We didn’t ask these illegal immigrants to come to this club,” he said. “They want to be involved where criminality is involved? Then this is the result.\"Federal agents detained 17 active-duty members of the U.S. military inside the club. Some of them had been working there as armed security, officials said. The service members were handed over to the Army’s criminal investigations division.On Thursday, the F.B.I. announced what appear to be the first criminal charges stemming from the raid, with the arrest of a soldier based at Fort Carson on charges of cocaine distribution. The Colorado Springs police said two people caught up in the raid were arrested on outstanding warrants.Some people in Colorado Springs questioned why more than 100 immigrants were detained during the raid while most other patrons had been allowed to go home.“They just went to a party,” said Sarah Myers, the daughter of an undocumented Mexican father, who joined the protest criticizing the raid. “Now their family doesn’t know where they are.”The Colorado Springs officers who assisted in the raid largely stayed on the edges to secure the area, according to Adrian Vasquez, the city’s police chief. He said city officers were not involved in detaining anyone on immigration charges.Last year, Colorado Springs passed a resolution declaring that it is not a sanctuary city. Even so, the police are bound by state laws that limit how law enforcement can cooperate with federal immigration agents.About 20 percent of Colorado Springs residents are Latino, and the city celebrates local Hispanic figures with a Hispanic Heritage Month. Still, Nayda Benitez, whose mother is undocumented and who is protected by an Obama-era rule that shields immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, said her family sometimes felt uncomfortable speaking Spanish in the city. She worried that the raid would drive even more immigrants into the shadows.“They don’t want to be targeted,” said Ms. Benitez, the organizing director of the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition.Outside the nightclub site, which has been boarded up, a food truck that sells barbecued chicken has lost much of its Spanish-speaking clientele since the raid. As he dished out thighs and drumsticks from the truck this week, Luis Perez, 21, said his Mexican American family had little sympathy for anyone who was arrested that night, regardless of their immigration status.He said he and his family had no plans to leave.“We feel that Colorado is the safest state,” he said.Jack Healy is a Phoenix-based national correspondent who focuses on the fast-changing politics and climate of the Southwest.

So all I can do is turn up.”The concert, titled Back to the Beginning and held at the band’s beloved Villa Park in Birmingham, features an all-star supporting lineup of metal greats including Metallica, Slayer and Anthrax. But this week, the frontman of another supporting act, Tool, voiced doubt about Osbourne’s ability to perform.“I’m cautious about saying, ‘Yeah! All in, he’s gonna do it’,” Maynard James Keenan said. “I don’t know what kind of modern miracles we’ll come up with to get him on stage to do the songs, but this is gonna be a challenge for them. So, I’m honoured to be a part of it, but I’m kinda preparing for the worst, but hoping for the best.”Osbourne has experienced an extraordinary run of bad luck with his health in recent years, including a 2019 fall that exacerbated an earlier spinal injury, requiring numerous surgeries. He has also suffered pneumonia and a longstanding infection, and has been diagnosed with a form of Parkinson’s.Speaking to the Guardian, he acknowledged the psychological toll: “You wake up the next morning and find that something else has gone wrong. You begin to think this is never going to end.” He said the reunion concert was conceived by his wife, Sharon, as “something to give me a reason to get up in the morning”.The original lineup of Black Sabbath: Tony Iommi, Ozzy Osbourne, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward. Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyBack to the Beginning will reunite Osbourne with his original Black Sabbath bandmates for the first time in 20 years: guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Geezer Butler and drummer Bill Ward. After forming in 1968 in Birmingham, the almighty weight of their sound, topped with Osbourne’s penetrating holler, ushered in an entire genre of heavy metal and resulted in classic albums such as Paranoid and Master of Reality. Osbourne left in 1979, then returned in 1997. The classic lineup played together until 2005, continuing without Ward for further tours and a final studio album, 2013’s 13.Osbourne detailed his preparation for the reunion concert to the Guardian. “I do weights, bike riding, I’ve got a guy living at my house who’s working with me. It’s tough – I’ve been laid up for such a long time. I’ve been lying on my back doing nothing and the first thing to go is your strength. It’s like starting all over again. I’ve got a vocal coach coming round four days a week to keep my voice going. I have problems walking. I also get blood pressure issues, from blood clots on my legs. I’m used to doing two hours on stage, jumping and running around. I don’t think I’ll be doing much jumping or running around this time. I may be sitting down.”He said he won’t be performing a full set. “We’re only playing a couple of songs each. I don’t want people thinking ‘we’re getting ripped off’, because it’s just going to be … what’s the word? … a sample, you’re going to get a few songs each by Ozzy and Sabbath.”Elsewhere in the Guardian interview, the other band members speak about their own reasons for returning, and Sharon details her and Ozzy’s plans for retirement.The concert, on 5 July, will raise funds for three charities: Cure Parkinson’s, Birmingham Children’s Hospital and the Birmingham-based Acorns Children’s Hospice.', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Ozzy Osbourne to perform final concert\\nENTITIES: Ozzy Osbourne, Black Sabbath, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Bill Ward, Sharon Osbourne, Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax, Tool, Maynard James Keenan\\nEVENT: Ozzy Osbourne confirms he will perform at Black Sabbath's final concert in Birmingham despite health issues, including Parkinson's and previous injuries.

McKinney, anybody. We’ll get there.‘I was scheduled to fight Terrance a while ago but my visa fell through, so we couldn’t get that in time. We had to cancel that fight and re-book it. I want that fight because I believe I can beat him in every facet of MMA. It’s just one of those things, I want it back not just for myself but for him too. I want him to know that I’m ready to fight any time.’Now with successive wins under his belt in the promotion, the Scot is 4-1 since joining the UFC and holds an impressive 13-2 overall record in professional MMA. Duncan lands a blow in his latest victory over English rival Jordan Vucenic The Problem poses for photos after March's victory in London In the build-up to his bout with Vucenic, the American Top Team fighter perhaps felt as though he had a lot of doubters, particularly following his loss to Manuel Torres back in February 2024, though now well on the winning trail again, he’s pleased to have been able to prove a lot of people wrong.‘Every fight is really important,’ he says. ‘I was a +400 underdog, the media were heavily pushing Jordan Vucenic throughout the process and fight week. Deep down inside, I was a little aggravated by that but it was motivation, it was never personal. But it was good to throw pie in their face!‘I always knew my potential. It’s a 50/50 sport, there’s always a winner and a loser. Your stars need to align on the night for it to happen.‘Unfortunately, without coming up with too many excuses, but going into that fight in Mexico and losing there was a lot of stuff going on - I could go on for days about it. It’s a loss, I want to take it under my belt, use it as motivation to get better. The stars need to align, you’re under the deep dark lights of the UFC, so it doesn’t matter how you feel on the night and what happens afterwards; you just need to keep pushing forward.‘I’m just looking forward to every fight I have. Win, lose or draw, I’m going to get better every single time.‘This is a lifestyle, it’s not a game. This isn’t football. Unfortunately, due to the nature of MMA, you don’t get to practise your sport every week. You have to simulate it through training because the fight itself is so traumatic on the body, so we need to make sure we’re getting as much time on the mats and in the cage as possible without injuring ourselves. That’s where I feel I grow, play and learn. It’s the most exciting part, it keeps you disciplined.’Through discipline and hard work, the improvement is clear to see in Duncan. The former shepherd has come a long way since his days in lesser-known promotions, including victories in his last two fights inside the first two rounds via submission. Now 13-2 overall, Duncan is already eyeing his next bout against Terrance McKinney The former shepherd is one of the Scottish stars in the UFC The lightweight has been fighting professionally for seven years now, just over two of them spent within the UFC, and though he is not lacking confidence in his own ability, Duncan is savvy enough to admit that he still has a long way to go before he’s recognised as one of the best in the world by the wider audience.‘In terms of top 10/15, I’m miles away from that,’ he admits. ‘The way the UFC works, with how they run their rankings, its favoured for their more exciting fighters and I believe I have that.

This is due in part to the mischaracterization of such approaches as ‘conversion therapy,’ the report said. “Psychotherapy is a noninvasive alternative to endocrine and surgical interventions for the treatment of pediatric gender dysphoria.”Though the report argues that this “exploratory therapy” is not the same as the long practice of “conversion therapy”—which is a practice of attempting to change someone’s sexual orientation or gender identity—advocates see little difference.“This report not only rejects health care best practices for transgender people, it goes a step further by recommending conversion therapy, though under a new, rebranded name, ‘exploratory therapy,’” said Casey Pick, director of law and policy at the LGBTQ+ advocacy group the Trevor Project, in an emailed statement. “Despite the report’s claims, this is, in fact, the same harmful practice of conversion therapy, just using friendlier language. We urge this Administration to respect and support people for who they are—and to let families and doctors make decisions based on what keeps people healthy, not government ideology.”Read More: Is Conversion Therapy the New Frontier for Anti-LGBTQ+ Groups?\\xa0The report arrives following a Trump Executive Order, titled “Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,” which threatens to cut federal funding to hospitals and medical providers that provide gender-affirming-care to people ages 19 or younger. The Executive Order directed HHS to release a report on the existing literature for treatment for children with gender dysphoria in 90 days, which fell on April 28.The language used in the report expresses a shift in policy and in sentiments regarding gender-affirming care—referring to the practice only as “Pediatric Medical Transition” and referring to “gender confirmation surgery” as “sex reassignment surgery.” This shift is in line with language brought about by Trump’s Jan. 20 Executive Order which proclaimed that there are only two sexes and that gender identity is “disconnected from biological reality,” calling for an erasure of the term.Read More: The Implications of Trump’s Executive Order on SexA federal judge issued a preliminary injunction against the order—and though the order hasn’t fully been enforced, some federal offices, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, issued notices stating that they will change their practices to comply with Trump\\'s restrictions on gender-affirming-care.Conversion therapy aims to alter someone’s sexual orientation or gender identity. It has been proven to be ineffective and harmful to LGBTQ+ people, and it can include a wide variety of practices.\"Endorsing this kind of therapy is devastating,” says Shannon Minter, vice president of legal of the National Center for Lesbian Rights. “Being gay, being transgender is not a choice. No amount of talking or persuasion or any kind of counseling can change that.”Gender-affirming-care is supported by the major medical associations in the U.S., including the American Academy of Pediatrics and American Medical Association. Meanwhile, conversion therapy has been discredited by numerous medical associations.As the Trump Administration ushers in an era of anti-trans policy at the federal level, Supreme Court cases could also dictate LGBTQ+ rights. In March, the nation’s highest court announced it would be hearing oral arguments for Chiles v. Salazar, which challenges Colorado’s conversion therapy ban under the premise that it infringes on free speech. A decision for U.S. v. Skrmetti—expected in June—will decide whether gender-affirming-care bans for minors are unconstitutional.“Those cases just raise the stakes of the issue even higher and create really maximum danger for transgender young people,” says Minter. “Worst-case scenario would be for the Supreme Court to uphold state laws banning essential medical care for these young people, and then turn around and strike down state laws protecting LGBTQ+ youth from conversion therapy. That would be a devastating double blow.”A 2022 report estimated that there were some 300,000 transgender youth ages 13 to 17 in the U.S., according to UCLA School of Law’s Williams Institute.Trump’s Executive Order on gender-affirming-care also called for investigations into this type of health care in sanctuary states, stating that medical professionals were “maiming… impressionable children.” Trump also declared April as “National Child Abuse Prevention Month,” and in his proclamation stated that he is “taking action to cut off all taxpayer funding to any institution that engages in the sexual mutilation of our youth.”More than 500 anti-LGBTQ+ bills were introduced on the state level for the 2025 legislative session, per the ACLU’s legislative tracker. In Kentucky, legislators voted to overturn their existing conversion therapy ban, legalizing the practice in the state. Attacks on gender-affirming-care have been much more rampant in recent years, as 26 states have passed laws limiting access to such care for trans and nonbinary people, according to the Human Rights Campaign.“This isn\\'t about us as doctors. This is about our patients and ensuring that they continue to get the science-based, evidence-based, standard-of-care medicine that really keeps them whole and healthy,” says Dr. Morissa Ladinsky, an academic general pediatrician at Stanford Medicine who treats children with gender dysphoria. Ladinsky was named as a plaintiff in Ladinsky v. Ivey, a 2022 lawsuit against an Alabama law that criminalizes parents for allowing their children to access gender-affirming-care. (The case was later taken down and another lawsuit against the Alabama law was filed.)Experts and advocacy organizations warn of the detrimental effects of conversion therapy. A peer-reviewed study conducted by the Trevor Project in 2020 found that young LGBTQ+ people who underwent conversion therapy were more than twice as likely to report attempting suicide compared to those who did not.Nearly half of all U.S. states ban the controversial practice, though attempts to ban it at the federal level have never proven fruitful. A 2023 Trevor Project report found that conversion therapy still happens across the country. Two years ago, there were at least 1,300 practitioners believed to be still offering the practice in the U.S.', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: HHS promotes 'exploratory therapy' for trans youth\\nENTITIES: HHS, Trump Administration, The Trevor Project, ACLU, Dr. Morissa Ladinsky\\nEVENT: HHS report promotes 'exploratory therapy' for transgender youth, sparking controversy and concerns about conversion therapy under a new name.\\nCONTEXT: Report encourages 'exploratory therapy' over gender-affirming care.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-02T16:09:34.237Z'}, {'id': 42841, 'sourceId': 12576, 'url': 'https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ratopia-is-a-city-builder-take-on-terraria-with-well-rats-and-it-just-launched-into-10-today', 'title': 'Ratopia is a city builder take on Terraria with, well, rats, and it just launched into 1.0 today', 'publishDate': '2025-05-01T17:10:56.000Z', 'content': 'Now you get to be the giant rat that makes all of the rules\\nImage credit: Cassel Games\\nI really quite like how simple a title Ratopia has.

It can cause chronic pain, heavy periods, extreme tiredness and fertility problems.According to the World Health Organization, endometriosis affects about 190 million women and girls globally. In the UK, approximately 1.5 million are estimated to have the condition.In final draft guidance published on Thursday, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) approved a daily tablet for adult patients of reproductive age who have had unsuccessful previous treatment for endometriosis.Linzagolix, also known as Yselty, works by blocking the hormones that contribute to the symptoms of endometriosis. It is taken once a day alongside “add-back” low-dose hormonal therapy to help manage potential menopausal symptoms and bone loss.In clinical trials, linzagolix was shown to reduce painful periods and non-menstrual pelvic pain, compared with a placebo drug, and is already approved for treating moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids.It is the second take-at-home pill for endometriosis to be made available on the NHS, after Nice approved relugolix combination therapy in March. It is estimated that more than 1,000 women a year will be eligible for the new treatment.Helen Knight, the director of medicines evaluation at Nice, said she was “pleased” to recommend linzagolix and that it offered “a convenient way for people with endometriosis to manage their condition and helps to ease pressure on NHS services”.Welcoming the announcement, the women’s health minister, Gillian Merron, said: “This could be a gamechanger for thousands of women battling endometriosis, which can be a debilitating and life-limiting condition.”Dr Sue Mann, the national clinical director in women’s health at NHS England, said: “This is welcome news for women with endometriosis who haven’t found relief from previous therapies or surgery – it’s another treatment option which will help women take control of their health and better manage the symptoms of this often painful and debilitating condition.”Emma Cox, the chief executive of Endometriosis UK, said: “Everyone with endometriosis should be able to choose the most appropriate management and treatment for them. But there are far too few options due to historic lack of research into the disease.“We welcome the approval of linzagolix for NHS use in England, however as it results in ‘medical menopause’ it will be suitable for only some with endometriosis.

He was from the US, where the company had no distributors or resellers, so the enquiry was forwarded to Herdman, who emailed across a technical brochure.\\n“This guy, Oleg, requested a meeting in LA,” said Kawai Herdman. “It was strange, as everything was outlined in the brochure. But Grant was adamant that the US market was important, so my dad set up a meeting for October 2019.”\\nWhen Herdman met Oleg and his colleague, it became clear that they weren’t looking to become resellers. They simply wanted a few devices.\\n“My dad wasn’t keen on selling direct to users without a reseller for tech support, as the app often crashed, requiring specialist support,” said Kawai Herdman.\\nNo business was done that day.\\nOleg phoned Herdman in December 2019 to request three Sky ECC devices. At the time, Herdman was in Lisbon pitching an on-premise privacy solution to the Serbian Embassy, which was already testing 10 Sky ECC devices supplied by another distributor.\\nThis distributor, also from Vancouver, joined Herdman at the meeting with the Serbian official in Lisbon.\\xa0“My father tried to talk Oleg out of the order. It was too much hassle to get three devices, load them and ship them to LA. But Oleg kept begging him.”\\nIn the end, Persall sourced and paid for three iPhones, set them up and mailed them to California. Oleg paid in bitcoin.\\nCriminal investigation\\nDutch and Belgian authorities infiltrated the Sky ECC network from 15 February 2021 to 9 March 2021, raiding 200 properties, arresting 48 people and seizing €1.2m in cash and 17 tonnes of cocaine.\\nOn 12 March 2021, Herdman and Jean-François Eap were indicted – in the Southern District of California – under the RICO Act, which targets the “professional enablers” of organised crime. In the indictment, prosecutors argued that Herdman was a top Sky ECC executive and that he sold software to criminals.\\n“When he saw the indictment, my father guessed that the LA businessmen were undercover cops. He still didn’t think he did anything illegal though,” said Kawai Herdman.\\nShe said Herdman’s links to the Southern District of California, where he was indicted, were at best tenuous. “The only tie to Southern California was this meeting. He only made one sale in the US, and it was to those guys.”\\nHerdman cooperated with the US Department of Justice and San Diego prosecutors. He attended a three-day meeting in Madrid with defence lawyers – at a cost of over $100,000 to himself – and representatives from the US Marshals Office and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).\\nUS officials interrogated him about his involvement with Sky ECC. They confirmed his suspicions about the LA meeting. His sales pitch, where he claimed he was Eap’s “right-hand man”, had been audio-recorded and used as evidence.\\n“A vague conversation about my dad’s colleagues at well-known crypto exchanges was seen as an offer to help launder the proceeds of crime. US marshall John Shindledecker commented that every BTC [bitcoin] exchange is money laundering,” said Kawai Herdman.\\nIn April 2021, Herdman was collaborating with US officials investigating Sky ECC. US prosecutor Meghan Heesch requested that Herdman relocate to Madrid to work with the DEA. They signed a proffer agreement stating that Herdman would provide information about Sky ECC, but it wouldn’t be used against him legally.\\nHerdman moved to the city. Yet in June 2021, Spanish police, acting on a French-European warrant, arrested him. He spent 14 days in Prisión de Estremera in Madrid, before being extradited to France and remanded in Maison d’arrêt de Fleury-Mérogis in Paris.\\nIt wasn’t until 20 March 2025 that Herdman received an English copy of the evidence against him. “But the recording of this LA meeting – the main evidence against him – hasn’t been disclosed. Instead, the French cited a US letter stating that it exists,” said Kawai Herdman.\\n“While my dad can only view the evidence against him in a secure part of the prison, after being strip-searched, 4,000 documents from his case were leaked to the media.”\\nSerbian links\\nOrganised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) journalists revealed that Herdman was accused of using Miodrag Kostić, son of a late Serbian politician, as a reseller. Kostić was on the run in Spain, with partner Sanja Petkovic, after a 2010 bank robbery in Niš, Serbia. He was extradited to Serbia in 2020 and sentenced to five years in prison.\\nIn January 2023, Serbian police, at the request of French prosecutors, searched the pair’s house in Niš and questioned Petkovic, asking her to give evidence against Herdman. She denied selling Sky ECC devices and refused to testify, while Kostić denied involvement when questioned three months later.The couple remain uncharged.\\nKnowledge of criminality\\nIn August 2017, WhatsApp messages between Herdman and Persall hinted that they knew that Sky ECC phones were used by criminals. Herdman complained about a competitor linked to “HA” – believed to be Hells Angels. He also mentioned “African mafia” clients and raised concerns that Serbian “gangs” could be tracked via IMEI.\\n“The mafia comment was a joke to describe some rude family friends,” said Kawai Herdman. “And it’s a bit of a stretch to say the Hells Angels are criminals. They’re a biker club. Harley-Davidson even did a brand partnership with them in the 1990s.”\\nShe added: “Though OCCRP reported on the alleged conversation about Serbian gangs, prosecutors were unable to verify whether the messages were sent by my father, so they aren’t being used in the case against him.”\\nBut for now, with the trial of Herdman and his co-defendants still pending, the case remains a contentious point in the global crackdown on encrypted communications.\\nRead more on Mobile software\\nSignalgate: Learnings for CISOs securing enterprise data\\nBy: Todd\\xa0Thiemann\\nCanadian businessman remains in French jail, accused of distributing Sky ECC cryptophones\\nBy: Bill\\xa0Goodwin\\nPolice swoop on Sky ECC cryptophone distributors in Spain and Holland\\nBy: Bill\\xa0Goodwin\\nTop 10 surveillance, journalism and encryption stories of 2024\\nBy: Bill\\xa0Goodwin', 'location': 'FRA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Sky ECC distributor's legal battle continues\\nENTITIES: Thomas Herdman, Sky ECC, Jean-François Eap, France, US Department of Justice\\nEVENT: Thomas Herdman awaits trial in France for allegedly distributing Sky ECC encrypted phones, despite cooperating with US investigators.\\nCONTEXT: Herdman's case highlights tensions between law enforcement and encrypted communication providers.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-02T16:09:34.237Z'}, {'id': 44868, 'sourceId': 12729, 'url': 'https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/showbiz-news/coronation-street-star-jude-riordan-31553260', 'title': \"Coronation Street star Jude Riordan issues two-word message after character 'change'\", 'publishDate': '2025-05-01T15:50:14.000Z', 'content': 'Manchester Evening News IconNewsCelebsCoronation StreetThe Sam Blakeman actor revealed a change for his character after confirming his future on the ITV soap16:50, 01 May 2025Coronation Street star Jude Riordan(Image: Jude Riordan Instagram)Coronation Street star Jude Riordan has issued a two-word message to a concerned fan about his soap future as he revealed a change for his character.The young actor is best known for playing Sam Blakeman in the ITV soap.

He first arrived as a backpacker, returned to do a master’s thesis on ayahuasca songs, and eventually did a PhD on the music of eight Indigenous peoples in the region. Along the way, he married a woman of the local Shipibo tribe and settled down.“I did not have a lot of money,” he told me, “so I had to make my living there.” He became a teacher. He built a house. He and his wife had children. That rare experience of joining the community, he said, forced him to realise that many of the assumptions he had picked up as an anthropologist were wrong.Like most outsiders, Brabec de Mori arrived in Peru thinking that ayahuasca had been used in the western Amazon for thousands of years. This is the standard narrative; look up resources on ayahuasca, and you’re bound to run into it. “Ayahuasca has been used in the Peruvian Amazon for millennia, long before the Spanish came to Peru, before the Incan empire was formed, before history,” states the website of the Ayahuasca Foundation, an organisation founded by a US citizen that offers ayahuasca retreats.Yet with time, Brabec de Mori came to see just how flimsy this narrative was. He discovered “a double discourse, which happens in all societies where there is tourism”, he said. “People start to tell the tourists – and I found that most Shipibo people did not distinguish tourists from researchers – the stories they think are interesting for them and not what they really live with.”His research showed just how large the discrepancy was. He discovered that, in their traditional stories about ayahuasca’s origins, many Shipibo-Konibo people said the brew came from the Kukama, one of the first peoples to be missionised and resettled during the Spanish conquest. Other peoples from the region remembered adopting it in the last 50 years. When he examined old reports of travellers, Brabec de Mori found that he could connect the historic diffusion of ayahuasca to the movements of missionaries and the spread of the rubber industry through the western Amazon.Then there was the linguistic evidence. Peoples in the Peruvian Amazon speak a dazzling variety of languages, but their words for ayahuasca and related activities are notably alike. The same goes for their music: lullabies, love songs and festive songs are varied, yet ayahuasca songs are very similar and often sung in non-Amazonian languages, like Quechua or Spanish. These patterns led him to conclude that ayahuasca hasn’t been in the western Amazon for millennia. Rather, it seems to have arrived and spread much more recently.Based on this and other evidence, Brabec de Mori argues that ayahuasca diffused through the Peruvian Amazon in the past 300 years. It is likely older among Tukanoan peoples further north, who, he suspects, transmitted the practice to populations missionised early in the lowlands. Yet in the regions most frequented by tourists, it seems to be a relative novelty. Brabec de Mori isn’t the first to make the argument – the anthropologist Peter Gow proposed something similar in 1994 – but he, more than anyone else, has found the anthropological data to support it.Brabec de Mori’s findings represent one of many cracks in the stories we tell about the history of psychedelics. As these substances become the mainstream, so do narratives about their role in human societies, narratives that often bind them to shamanism. Just look at the media coverage. In 2020, a journalist for the Washington Post wrote that consciousness-altering substances “have been used by Indigenous cultures for physical and psychological healing for thousands of years”. Michael Pollan endorsed a similar narrative throughout his bestselling 2018 book, How to Change Your Mind, writing that “elements of shamanism might have a role to play in psychedelic therapy – as indeed it has probably done for several thousand years”.These quotes all subscribe to what I call the global archaic psychedelic shamanism (Gaps) hypothesis. It consists of three claims. First, that psychedelics have long been widespread. Second, that use of psychedelics goes back to the ancient past. Third, that psychedelics have long been used by shamans for therapeutic healing.Like so many of the stories we tell about human history, the Gaps hypothesis is rooted in glimmers of truth. Yet much of what passes as psychedelic history has been distorted by a seductive mixture of flimsy archaeological evidence, outdated anthropological approaches and economically expedient ideology. “It’s a romantic image that Indigenous people have been using everything they do for thousands of years,” Brabec de Mori said. “If we change the picture, it’s kind of unromantic, and it seems that people like romanticism.”In June 1955, the vice-president of public relations at JP Morgan arrived in a remote village in the Mexican highlands. He was accompanied by Allan Richardson, a photographer and teacher at an elite girls’ school in Manhattan. They had come to eat fungus.The PR man, Robert Gordon Wasson, was a mycophile. For decades, he and his wife Valentina Pavlovna Wasson had studied humanity’s relationship with mushrooms; Mexico would be the most promising place to explore it. Four centuries earlier, Spanish chroniclers had recorded how the Aztecs consumed a powerful psychoactive substance called teonanacatl, or “flesh of the gods”. Botanists and anthropologists had bickered over its identity until the 1920s and 1930s, when they discovered that communities in the Oaxacan mountains swallowed psychotropic mushrooms in night-time ceremonies.A Peruvian shaman of the Amazon Shipibo-Konibo people, Lauro Hinostroza, performs a ritual. Photograph: Carl de Souza/AFP/Getty ImagesWasson learned about the ceremonies in 1952. The next year, he and Valentina travelled to the town of Huautla de Jiménez, where they observed, but did not participate in, a mushroom ritual. He returned to Mexico again in 1954 and collected ethnographic data. In 1955, he travelled down a third time, this time with his photographer friend, and was lucky enough to meet a Mazatec shaman named María Sabina. Valentina and their daughter joined a day or two later. María Sabina “had presence”, Wasson later wrote. He and Valentina considered her “a woman of rare moral and spiritual power, dedicated in her vocation”. He met her through a local town official under the pretence of determining the health of his son Peter.It was the ideal introduction. Not only had she spent her life exploring the psychic worlds accessed through mushrooms, but she was willing to let the foreigners try them, too. Wasson wrote up his experience for Life magazine in an article headlined Seeking the Magic Mushroom. Over two nights, he ate mushrooms under María Sabina’s guidance. When Valentina and their 18-year-old daughter arrived, he gave them batches to enjoy as well.Published in the issue of 13 May 1957, the article popularised the term “magic mushrooms” and introduced millions of westerners to the fungi’s mind-melding effects. Six days later, Valentina told her story in the Week, a magazine included in 37 newspapers and circulated to 14 million readers.The impacts of the accounts were immediate and far-reaching. They sparked a surge of interest in Indigenous practices and the spiritual and therapeutic applications of hallucinogens. For many readers, the tales of otherworldly visions – of camel caravans, resplendent palaces, a mythological beast in a chariot and the 18th-century court of Louis XV, to name a few – promised gateways to new realms. Writers, academics and everyday adventurers started to make pilgrimages to Mexico, eager to taste the flesh of the gods.The Wassons helped establish two tenets of the Gaps hypothesis: the ancientness of psychedelic use and its ubiquity. After decades spent studying mushrooms, Wasson wrote, he and Valentina found that peoples everywhere, from “the Arabs of the desert” to “the Māori of New Zealand”, regarded mushrooms as supernaturally powerful. This discovery led them to “hazard a bold surmise: was it not probable that, long ago, long before the beginnings of written history, our ancestors had worshipped a divine mushroom?”Like a fungal mycelium colonising new terrain, the threads of the Gaps hypothesis had taken root.In the decades since the Wassons’ articles, assertions of widespread archaic psychedelic use have diversified. They’ve inspired theories that religion broadly and Christianity, in particular, began with psychedelics or other hallucinogens. The American mystic and psychonaut Terence McKenna proposed that human cognitive evolution was catalysed by a prehistoric psychedelic and that some of our modern issues, including myopia, might reflect our alienation from regular psychedelic use. With the rise of two industries, psychedelic tourism and clinical medicinal use, these stories have become commonplace mantras, often tinged with a therapeutic flair.It makes sense why these claims are so popular. As psychedelics prove effective for treating disorders like addiction and anxiety, scientists and enthusiasts push for their broader societal acceptance. Connecting psychedelics – and particularly, psychedelic therapy – to ancient worldwide traditions makes them, according to historian Erika Dyck, “more natural, more wholesome, perhaps more spiritual”.But is there any truth to these stories? In 2018, I met a man who set out to answer that question. Martin Fortier was a young anthropologist, philosopher and cognitive scientist based at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris. Like Brabec de Mori, he worked with Shipibo-Konibo communities in the Peruvian Amazon. His interests were wide-ranging, but the project I found most exciting was a database he called Huthac, or “Hallucinogenic Use Through History and Across Cultures”. It was, he said, “the first academic source exhaustively documenting hallucinogenic use”.It was a gloriously ambitious undertaking, meant to include more than a thousand cultures. To build it, Fortier scoured hundreds of sources, including academic books, historical chronicles, and the diaries of explorers. For every mention of hallucinogens, he noted who used them, how they were used, whether they were used in hallucinogenic doses and how reliable the evidence was.A drawing of Piltzintecuhtli, one of the deities described in the Codex Borgia Español. Photograph: AlamyThe project promised to be the largest, most systematic survey of drug use across human societies. Unfortunately, it was never finished. In April 2020, at the age of 30, he died of cancer. Before his death, he published his preliminary findings in a series of posts on his Facebook page, sparking a small academic firestorm. He found that reliable evidence for early psychedelic usage was limited to the Rio Grande area (the modern-day border between the US and Mexico) and southward. And even in those regions, usage was rare. In pre-Columbian times, Fortier estimated, only 5% of Indigenous American groups used psychedelics – and this, he wrote, “is probably a very liberal estimate”. By these counts, 1% or less of the world’s cultures consumed psychedelics at this time.Fortier’s tally was limited to classic, or serotonergic, psychedelics: substances like DMT, mescaline, psilocybin and anything else whose effects mostly come from activating serotonin 2A receptors. But even if we expand to a broader usage – including drugs like ibogaine, deliriants and dissociatives – hallucinogenic use remains marginal by his count. “These findings deeply challenge the view that hallucinogenic use is very ancient and belongs to an ancestral shamanic tradition that would have migrated from Siberia to the New World,” he wrote. “More broadly, they also challenge the view that most archaic cultures used hallucinogens.”Other research has echoed Martin’s findings. In his 2006 book Shroom, the ecologist Andy Letcher investigated every presumed case of traditional hallucinogenic mushroom consumption in history. He confirmed only two: the use of psilocybin mushrooms in pre-Columbian Mexico and the use of Amanita muscaria mushrooms by scattered groups in northern Eurasia.Last year, a team of researchers published a paper that suggested that Basotho healers in Lesotho add psilocybin mushrooms to psychoactive brews that are fed to patients. As of this writing, ethnographic research has yet to be conducted, but, if confirmed, this would be the only direct evidence of the hallucinogenic use of serotonergic psychedelics in traditional contexts outside the Americas.If Fortier and Letcher are right, psychedelics have been the exception in the history of humanity, not the rule. Yes, some peoples used them before a couple of hundred years ago, but they aren’t nearly as common as we’ve come to believe, and various popular examples seem relatively recent.Still, some scholars disagree. Of the holdouts, most point to art and literature. They cite shroomy figures in cave paintings and descriptions of lost rituals involving mind-altering substances. To be fair, compelling symbolic evidence exists for some cases recognised by Fortier and Letcher. Pre-Hispanic manuscripts from Mexico, for example, depicted mythological figures holding and even eating mushrooms. The Codex Vindobonensis, a 52-page document made of tanned deer hide in the early 1500s, has one such scene. Near the bottom right, we find the solar deity Piltzintecuhtli, the “Prince of Flowers”, holding a pair of mushrooms and crying, which some scholars take as a sign of trance. Nearby, seven gods are shown sitting and holding mushrooms, possibly representing a night-time mushroom ceremony. Along with other codices, the Codex Vindobonensis suggests that mushroom use was ritualised, mythologised and ensconced into Mesoamerican societies when the Spanish arrived.A separate set of discoveries, however, raises the possibility that mushroom consumption extends earlier and spans much more of the globe than Fortier and Letcher concede. In 2019, Michael Winkelman published “Evidence for entheogen use in prehistory and world religions” in the Journal of Psychedelic Studies. The article is a smorgasbord of supposed artistic and literary indications of ancient hallucinogens, listing sculptures, cave art and passages of mythology. Yet, as Letcher warned more than a decade earlier, “none of these inferences is unequivocal, and each is open to a range of alternative explanations”.Let’s review a couple of examples. Winkelman presents what he calls “the mushroom stones of Chucuito”, large sculptures with domed caps and elongated stems discovered in highland Peru. It’s certainly possible that these were made to resemble mushrooms. Yet Winkelman fails to acknowledge the leading interpretation of these statues – that they’re penises. In fact, the site’s local name – Inka Uyo – might come from the Quechua word for penis. Winkelman includes a picture of some “mushroom stones” yet does not present the most prominent statue, which towers above the others and has a large groove resembling the external opening of the urethra.Or take what might be the best-known example of ancient psychedelic iconography: the mushroom shaman, first popularised in Terence McKenna’s book Food of the Gods (1992). McKenna’s image is of Algerian rock art dated to between 7,000 and 9,000 years ago. It shows a bee-faced figure in a sumo squat, feathers poking out of its head and a chequerboard of dots covering its body and spilling out from its legs. Most notably, it holds batches of mushrooms, another 50 or so sprouting from its limbs and torso.The mushroom shaman is an icon of the psychedelic community. You can find it printed on shirts, mugs, paintings and face masks. But as Letcher discovered, the popular image “is not a photo of the original, but a copy” made by McKenna’s wife at the time, Kat Harrison. In fact, Harrison never saw the original painting, but instead deciphered a photograph in a book. And rather than copying the photo, she filled in features she thought were damaged or incomplete. Harrison’s drawing clearly shows a supernatural figure blossoming with mushrooms, but “whether that was the intention of the original artist[s] is far from settled,” wrote Letcher. An earlier archaeologist thought it was a sheep-man.“The role of psilocybin mushrooms in the ancient evolution of human religions is attested to [in] fungiform petroglyphs, rock artefacts and mythologies from all major regions of the world,” asserts Winkelman. We’ve seen that at least some of the petroglyphs and artifacts are open to alternative interpretations. But what do we make of mushrooms starring in the world’s mythologies? The Wassons, remember, had made a similar claim. Does it hold up?I conducted a simple test using the electronic Human Relations Area Files, a repository based at Yale that contains nearly 7,000 digitised books and articles by anthropologists, missionaries and others, covering hundreds of human societies. The topics of each paragraph in the files have been manually tagged. As of August 2023, 51,025 paragraphs, covering 325 cultural groups, were about mythology. How many of those include the words “mushroom” or “mushrooms”? Just 22. Those appeared in 19 cultures. For the most part, these mentions do not ascribe mushrooms any supernatural power, with fungi instead appearing as asides or scenery. Mushrooms appear very little in this collection of mythology, even compared to culturally important psychoactive plants with far smaller ranges, like peyote and kava.An image representing a local woman smoking cigarettes with ‘magic mushrooms’ seen at the entrance to the Cenote Canunchen in Homun, Mexico. Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty ImagesThis was a preliminary search. I invite others to do larger and more careful versions. But it is an attempt to probe the world’s mythology using methods that are systematic and unbiased.Rather than cherrypicking a couple of ambiguous examples and forcing a once-universal fungus cult on to them, I searched for mushrooms in possibly the most comprehensive resource on the world’s mythology. And I found squat.People don’t just claim that psychedelics are old and widespread; they also believe that the modern therapeutic use echoes ancient shamanic traditions. As UCLA psychiatry professor Charles Grob explained in an interview with Gwyneth Paltrow’s wellness brand Goop, “The shaman would administer these compounds only for very clear circumscribed reasons, such as an initiation rite or a healing ceremony to address individuals with severe medical or psychological problems.”Reasonable, right? A patient comes to the shaman with a psychological problem, like depression or existential angst. The shaman administers the psychedelic, and the patient is healed. It’s like visiting a psychiatrist, except with more ritual.But this is a misleading characterisation of how shamans have traditionally used psychedelics. The best way to appreciate this is to simply watch them taking the substances. An easily accessible depiction of shamans using psychedelics is anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon’s 1973 short documentary Magical Death, which portrays shamanism among the Yanomami of Venezuela. The film’s beginning shows the shaman Dedeheiwa healing illness. He snorts a psychedelic snuff powder and calls spirits, which he experiences as entering his feet and climbing through his body. He draws on their power to remove illness and battle evil spirits. No patients consume psychedelics, and there’s no mention of treating mental disorders.If the beginning represents a slight divergence from the popular story, the next part of the film is a total overhaul. Intent on killing babies in an enemy village, a squad of shamans snorts the snuff. Some shamans act like helpless babies. Others bend over the ashes and imitate murderous spirits devouring the babies’ souls. As proof of their success, Dedeheiwa and another shaman act like dying babies, writhing “in agony in the ashes”.Psychedelic shamanism here is nothing like the view endorsed on Goop. Anthropological research conducted since the mid-20th century shows that, among the Yanomami and many other groups, shamans use psychedelics to tap into the supernatural and provide services like weather change, divination, physical healing and aggressive sorcery. They might confront heinous sorcerers. They might purge patients of treacherous ghosts. They might become supernatural beings themselves.Psychedelics – like dancing, drumming, darkness and other psychotropic drugs – push shamans into states where they and their communities believe them to access otherworldly powers. This contrasts with the western clinical application, where psychedelics are administered like medicine and used to break down patients’ harmful patterns of thought.This misconception seems to stem partly from biased interpretations of anthropological data. When I asked Charles Grob for sources describing the psychotherapeutic use of psychedelics, he pointed me to Marlene Dobkin de Rios, who conducted research on ayahuasca use among Peruvian mestizos in the 1960s and 1970s – groups that have been subjected to the influence of Christian missionaries for the last four centuries. There are obvious limitations with making inferences about “typical” psychedelic shamanism using religious and medicinal practices so profoundly shaped by European colonialism. As Dobkin de Rios herself has written, throughout the Peruvian Amazon, “influences of Roman Catholic proselytisation, mixed with medieval metaphysical beliefs, and influenced by evangelical Protestantism, are widespread”.Putting those issues aside, Dobkin de Rios’s work is still much less a confirmation of the Goop view than a demonstration of its Euro-American flair. Consider her book A Hallucinogenic Tea, Laced with Controversy (2008), co-authored with the Peruvian journalist Roger Rumrrill. She and Rumrrill compared Amazonian shamans who treat western tourists with those who work with locals. The tourist healers charge sums usually impossible for locals to pay. And they embody the Goop view: they treat psychological distress by administering ayahuasca to patients.“These tourists come to try to resolve personal problems,” said healer Guillermo Arévalo in an interview published in the book. According to the authors, Arévalo had a university degree in pharmacology and was the owner of Espíritu de Anaconda, a healing centre that charged foreigners 40 to 50 dollars per day at the time of the interview. “They suffer a type of psychosis and psychological upheaval. They suffer from fear, paranoia and other problems. These patients are ones that I treat with ayahuasca.”The authors contrasted these tourist shamans with those who treated locals. “Ayahuasca played an important role in this worldview where evil men and women would be able to bewitch their enemies and cause them illness, bad luck and even death,” they wrote. Shamans used ayahuasca to contact supernatural realms and identify and battle witches causing misfortune. Insofar as ayahuasca was used to treat distress, this meant combating evil.“What a difference,” they wrote, “from the psychodynamic worldview of Freud and contemporary western psychology.”For Erika Dyck, who has studied the history of attitudes about psychedelics, stories about traditional psychedelic use are rooted in financial and ideological goals. “A lot of the enthusiasm for investing in psychedelic drugs,” she said, stems from an expectation that they will bring “a paradigm shift in the way we think about mental disorders.” Our stories reflect that goal.

(I sat in on a pentesting session during the RSAC’s cybersecurity conference this week, and I don’t envy them their jobs.) But not all of it is—especially when it comes to big wins for us everyday users.\\nSo, see this?\\nThis account type is a security problem.PCWorld\\nThat is what David Weston, CVP of Enterprise and OS Security\\xa0at Microsoft, says is the biggest security threat to your PC.\\nThe reason: Admin permissions are a major opportunity for hackers. Think of it like your house—once someone’s inside, they can go into any part of it and mess around. In particular, if you use an Administrator account daily, then remote access to your PC is possible—and those two things combined can enable real damage. Hackers can not only slip into your PC, but they can also spy on you, add software to your system, run malicious code, change software settings, and more.\\nThe solution: In your Windows settings (“Accounts”), create a separate local Administrator account with a strong, unique password. Whenever you need higher-level permissions, you’ll be prompted for your admin account’s password. (You won’t need to log out of your normal account, so it’s pretty seamless.)\\nNext, downgrade your existing account to a Standard user. It’s a quick change and easy to do.\\nCreate additional users on this screen. Once done, you must elevate the account’s permissions from Standard User to Administrator.PCWorld\\nYou can reference our past guide on how to create the new Administrator account and downgrade your existing account to a standard user for step-by-step instructions. While it refers to Windows 10, I’ve verified the instructions apply to Windows 11, too.\\nOnce you complete these tasks, you’re good to go.

He wants to go out a winner, not a first round loser.'The Lakers have more than half of the projected 2025-26 cap tied to James and Luka Doncic, who are due $52million (player option) and $46million respectively, per Spotrac. LeBron James wants the LA Lakers to make a big splash this offseason after their playoff exit The 40-year-old has no plans to walk away from the sport despite his underwhelming form Thus, adding Antetokounmpo (who will have a cap hit north of $54million) or Durant ($51million) would require the team to go well into the luxury tax and likely handicap the rest of their roster.That is, unless James declines his player option and signs a more team-friendly deal.The source told DailyMail.com that such a scenario is indeed a possibility, while reiterating the four-time MVP's desire to keep playing.\\xa0'LeBron will not retire. If that is the talk in the next few weeks, it is not going to happen,' they said.'He might choose to not take his player option and end up signing a new contract to allow the Lakers to go after a few free agents, but he isn't going to retire, he is going to give it another chance as he would like to have a full season with Luka and see what they can do with a revamped team.'Durant is widely expected to ask for a trade this summer after the Suns missed the play-in, while the chatter of a potential Antetokounmpo exit from Milwaukee continues to get louder.The Bucks were comfortably beaten in five games in their first-round playoff series to the Pacers, and the outlook looks bleak moving forward for Milwaukee after Damian Lillard ruptured his Achilles in the playoffs.Nonetheless, the Lakers are considered one of the\\xa0most likely landing spots for the 'Greek Freak' if he does ask out. James averaged 25.4 points per night in the Lakers first-round series vs. Minnesota James wants the Lakers to go for Giannis Antetokounmpo (left) or Kevin Durant (center) He will return next season so that his partnership with Luka Doncic will get a full year to thrive Any such trade for Durant or Antetokounmpo would likely have to involve some combination of Austin Reaves, Rui Hachimura and/or Dorian-Finney Smith (the Lakers' other three starters in Game 5) to make the finances work.Regardless, Lakers and NBA fans should expect James back next year for his 23rd season. The 40-year-old did show some of his wear and tear at times in the Minnesota series, as he shot just nine-of-21 in the series-clinching Game 5 loss.Durant, 36, and Antetokounmpo, 30, would certainly give James and Doncic an added boost in a loaded Western Conference.\", 'location': 'N/A', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: LeBron wants Durant or Giannis on Lakers\\nENTITIES: LeBron James, Luka Doncic, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, LA Lakers, Rob Pelinka\\nEVENT: LeBron James wants the Lakers to acquire Kevin Durant or Giannis Antetokounmpo to form a super-team with him and Luka Doncic, even if it means taking a team-friendly deal.\\nCONTEXT: LeBron wants another championship before retiring, pushing for a super-team.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-02T16:09:34.237Z'}, {'id': 42371, 'sourceId': 12520, 'url': 'https://www.techspot.com/news/107755-fcc-moves-ban-chinese-labs-testing-electronics-sold.html', 'title': 'FCC moves to ban Chinese labs from testing electronics sold in the US', 'publishDate': '2025-05-01T12:01:00.000Z', 'content': 'Serving tech enthusiasts for over 25 years.\\nTechSpot means tech analysis and advice you\\xa0can\\xa0trust.\\nCutting corners: Not content with banning sales of high-end AI chips to China and imposing 145% tariffs on many imports from the country, the US government is now trying to stop companies from using Chinese labs to test electronic devices available in the United States.\\nFCC chairman Brendan Carr writes that before any electronic devices, such as smartphones or computers, can be imported or sold in the US, they must be tested at a lab to ensure compliance with FCC regulations.

In her most extensive public remarks since leaving office in January following her defeat to Trump, Harris said she’s inspired by Americans fighting Trump’s agenda despite threats to their freedom or livelihood. “Instead of an administration working to advance America’s highest ideals, we are witnessing the wholesale abandonment of those ideals,” Harris said a day after Trump reached 100 days in office.Before Wednesday, Harris had barely mentioned Trump by name since she conceded defeat to him in November.In a 15-minute speech, she spoke to the anxiety and confusion that have gripped many of her supporters since Trump took office but discouraged despair. “They are counting on the notion that if they can make some people afraid, it will have a chilling effect on others. But what they have overlooked is that fear is not the only thing that’s contagious,” Harris said. “Courage is contagious.”Trump went after Harris in a campaign-style rally Tuesday marking his 100th day in office. He sarcastically called her a “great border czar\" and a “great candidate,\" and repeated some of the applause lines he routinely delivered during the campaign. Until Harris replaced Joe Biden atop the Democratic ticket last summer, Trump said, “I knew nothing about her.\"Harris cautioned Americans against viewing Trump’s administration as merely chaotic, casting it instead as a “high-velocity event,” the culmination of extensive work on the right to remake government.“A vessel is being used for the swift implementation of an agenda that has been decades in the making,\" Harris said. “An agenda to slash public education. An agenda to shrink government and then privatize its services. All while giving tax breaks to the wealthiest among us.”Harris chose a friendly audience for her return to the political arena, addressing the 20th anniversary gala for Emerge America, an organization that recruits and trains Democratic women to run for office. It grew in part from Harris’ run for San Francisco district attorney in the early 2000s.The speech was delivered below luminous chandeliers in a gold-trimmed ballroom in the landmark Palace Hotel.Harris is ramping up her public presence as Democrats nationally search for a path forward after November\\'s election, in which Republicans also won control of Congress. While a slate of high-profile Democrats — from governors to businessmen — seek leadership roles within the party, the former vice president retains unique influence and would reshape any future race she chooses to enter. She praised Democrats who have been especially prolific in criticizing Trump, name-dropping lawmakers diverse in their ideology and style: Sens. Cory Booker, Chris Van Hollen, Chris Murphy and Bernie Sanders along with Reps. Jasmine Crockett, Maxwell Frost and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. But she did not take a stand in one of her party\\'s central divides, neither calling for mass mobilization like Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker or questioning Democratic positioning on key issues like California Gov. Gavin Newsom. “I’m not here tonight to offer all the answers,” Harris said. “But I am here to say this: You are not alone and we are all in this together.”But she warned that things will probably get worse before they get better.“The one check, the one balance, the one power that must not fail is the voice of the people,” she said. Harris, a former state attorney general and U.S. senator from California, has not discouraged speculation that she might enter the race to replace the term-limited Newsom, himself a potential contender for president. And she has not ruled out another run for the White House. She did not address her future Wednesday. She continues to fundraise, using a joint committee that includes Harris for President, the Democratic National Committee and state Democratic parties. The committee, the Harris Victory Fund, reported having about $4.5 million on hand at the end of March, according to federal records. In recent fundraising emails, Harris has been blunt about the need for Democrats to unify ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.Democrats need to “organize and stop Trump’s agenda while electing Democrats everywhere,” she wrote in recent emails. “There has never been a more important time for a strong Democratic Party — one that is willing to stand up to Donald Trump, Elon Musk and what they are doing to this country.”The event marks a homecoming of sorts. Harris lives in Los Angeles but she is from the San Francisco Bay Area, where her political career is rooted. For her first major speech since the election, she chose familiar terrain and a friendly, in some ways familial, crowd.Lisa Gotbhi, a health care executive in San Francisco, said Harris\\' loss last year was a “shock,\" but “she’s a voice we need and a leader we need. Let’s get back in the fight.”', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Harris criticizes Trump, hints at future plans\\nENTITIES: Kamala Harris, Donald Trump, Emerge America, Democratic Party\\nEVENT: Kamala Harris criticized Donald Trump's policies in a speech at the Emerge America gala, accusing him of abandoning American ideals.\\nCONTEXT: Harris's speech fuels speculation about future political ambitions.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-02T16:09:34.237Z'}, {'id': 44392, 'sourceId': 12679, 'url': 'https://www.ok.co.uk/celebrity-news/bake-offs-paul-hollywood-unexpected-35152842', 'title': \"Bake Off's Paul Hollywood unexpected hero after plane crash\", 'publishDate': '2025-05-01T13:54:36.000Z', 'content': 'A pilot has shared the terrifying moment he \\'couldn\\'t breathe or see\\' as his plane plummeted into a field - only to be rescued by none other than TV star Paul Hollywood.

Their care can be expensive given complex health needs.According to the complaint, originally brought by a whistle-blower and joined by the Justice Department, three of the nation’s largest health insurance companies — Aetna; Elevance Health, formerly known as Anthem; and Humana — are accused of paying kickbacks to three large brokers, eHealth, GoHealth and SelectQuote, to increase enrollment in their Medicare Advantage plans. Those brokerage firms are also charged with misconduct.The complaint, filed in a federal court in Boston, asserted that the kickbacks occurred from at least 2016 through 2021, and it accused Aetna and Humana of discriminating against people with disabilities.Aetna, Elevance, GoHealth and Humana denied the allegations, while the others did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The lawsuit is one of the first indications by the Trump administration that some Medicare Advantage plans will continue to be subject to federal scrutiny. Critics of these plans, including congressional lawmakers, have faulted the incredibly popular policies for using overly aggressive marketing tactics and overcharging the federal government. Medicare Advantage plans now cover more than half of all individuals enrolled in the federal program.During the Senate confirmation hearing for Dr. Mehmet Oz, now the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, he replied to senators concerned about excess in the private plans that there was a “new sheriff” in town.Brokers often play a pivotal role in helping older and disabled Americans eligible for Medicare to decide which private plan to choose. In the complaint, the brokers are accused of steering an individual into the plan that paid them the most rather than the one best suited to that person’s needs. In recent years, small local brokerages have given way to large national organizations employing many agents and using call centers and websites, like the companies named in the suit. They now tend to rely on computer programs to help brokers identify the best plan for each caller, a technology that could make the kind of steering described in the lawsuit easier.Last year, the Biden administration finalized a regulation designed to lower the fees insurers could pay these companies to enroll patients, after congressional testimony and consumer complaints that insurers were awarding bonuses for enrolling more people in particular plans, regardless of their individual needs. But a lawsuit has put the rule on hold.In referring to cases involving people with disabilities, federal prosecutors were blunt: “The alleged efforts to drive beneficiaries away specifically because their disabilities might make them less profitable to health insurance companies are even more unconscionable,” U.S. Attorney Leah B. Foley said. “Profit and greed over beneficiary interest is something we will continue to investigate and prosecute aggressively.”Reed Abelson covers the business of health care, focusing on how financial incentives are affecting the delivery of care, from the costs to consumers to the profits to providers.Margot Sanger-Katz is a reporter covering health care policy and public health for the Upshot section of The Times.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Insurers accused of Medicare kickbacks, discrimination\\nENTITIES: Justice Department, Aetna, Elevance Health, Humana, eHealth, GoHealth, SelectQuote\\nEVENT: The Justice Department accused three large health insurers of paying illegal kickbacks to brokers for steering people into private Medicare plans and discriminating against people with disabilities.\\nCONTEXT: The lawsuit is one of the first indications that Medicare Advantage plans will continue to be subject to federal scrutiny.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-02T16:09:34.237Z'}, {'id': 44248, 'sourceId': 12673, 'url': 'https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/2049288/dog-trainer-keep-dog-cool-summer-heat', 'title': 'Keep your dog cool in hot weather using vet’s ‘best’ method which requires 1 item', 'publishDate': '2025-05-01T12:32:00.000Z', 'content': 'A dog trainer at South End Dog Training has shared \\'the best\\' ways to keep your dogs and pets cool during hot summer days, and warned against doing one thing. 13:32, Thu, May 1, 2025 | UPDATED: 13:37, Thu, May 1, 2025 A dog expert has shared the best ways to help keep your dogs cool in summer (stock image) (Image: Getty)As the weather is getting warmer, a dog trainer has urged pet owners to look after their furry friends and make sure they stay nice and cool during the hot sunny days.While it\\'s important for us humans to stay hydrated and keep ourselves from overheating during the summer, we also have to make sure that our four-legged friends do the same, but it may be easier said than done.According to the Blue Cross, dogs rely on panting and releasing heat through their paw pads and nose to regulate their body temperature. If they cannot cool down, they can quickly develop heatstroke, which can be fatal.To help, Adam Spivey, director and head trainer at Southend Dog Training, has answered a follower\\'s question about what the best ways to help keep our dogs cool are, and he went on to share a long list of ideas.At the start of the video. Adam said: \"The best way to cool your dog down on a hot day, provided your dog is fit and healthy is you can use things like cooling mats, you can use things like cool jackets, which is a coat that you put on your dog. You put it in water and you bring it out. [...] And the dog wears it and it keeps them nice and cool.\"He then continued with his list, and shared the importance of keeping lots of water around for your dogs to drink, even on walks, as they can get dehydrated.“Make sure there’s plenty of water for them to drink,\" Adam said. \"Make sure there’s plenty of shade, you can use fans, you can use air con. And what you do is you get up earlier and take him out for a walk, or you go out much later when it’s not so hot and overbearing.\"As for giving them cold food, he said: \"You can also give them frozen treats. You can also get a little paddling pool for the dogs. There’s lots of ways you can keep your dog nice and cool.\"He then went on to say: \"Just think of all the ways that you like to keep yourself nice and cool.

Read our Privacy PolicyLastly, Adam went on to urge dog owners to keep their dogs inside if they weather gets too hot, as it can be fatal for them to be outside in that heat.\"But most importantly, if it’s too hot and it’s heat stroke weather, do not take the dogs out on a walk. That will kill it,\" Adam said.According to the Blue Cross, to prevent your dogs from getting heatstroke, they recommend always keeping bowls filled to the brim with water around the house. You can also add ice cubes to the water to make it even colder, as well as offering cold treats such as ice licks and dog-friendly smoothies.You should also limit walks and exercise to early morning when temperatures are lower.

The solution to that security utopia is passkeys, which are essentially digital keys that turn your trusted devices into a login key.\\nRecommended Videos\\nThese digital keys are also protected behind a biometric lock.\\xa0The next time you try to log in, you will get a prompt on your phone or PC. You simply have to agree to it by verifying your identity via a face unlock, fingerprint scan, or entering the device password.\\nWhat is changing?\\n“New users will have several passwordless options for signing into their account and they’ll never need to enroll a password,” the company says in a security update. For users with an existing Microsoft account, they can go ahead and delete the saved passwords from the account dashboard, and switch entirely to passkeys.\\nMicrosoft\\nUsers with two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled will no longer be asked to enter their password. Instead, they will be directly asked to enter the 2FA code sent as an SMS or email. The next time they try to access their account, they won’t even have to access the 2FA code, and will switch entirely to access through passkeys.\\nGoogle, Apple, and Microsoft have all joined the passkey revolution. Passkeys are created using cryptography techniques that follow the FIDO security protocols. The key to enable login for any service is stored privately on the user’s device.\\nHow to use a passkey?\\nThese private keys can only be used once users verify their identity using a fingerprint or face scan, or unlock their device with a PIN or password. If you are in the Windows ecosystem and want to enable passkeys for your Microsoft account, the best way forward is using the Authenticator app.\\nMicrosoft\\nThe app is available for both Android and iOS devices. After registering the passkey, users only have to enable it within the settings app. On Android phones, they can flick the Authenticator toggle in the Passwords & accounts dashboard in the Settings app.\\nOn an Apple device, you need to enable it from within the Autofill & Passwords section in the Settings app. Passkeys are supported across Windows 10 and 11, macOS Ventura and later versions, iOS 16, Android 9, Chrome OS 109, Microsoft Edge (version 109), Safari (version 16), and Chrome on mobile devices.\\nIf you don’t like Microsoft’s authenticator app, you can choose to save passkeys in third-party apps, as well, such as 1Password.

Kennedy Jr. in the Oval Office on April 18, 2025.(Andrew Harnik / Getty Images)\\nThe first 100 days of Donald Trump’s second administration ended this week. Many, including me, have written about the devastation these few months have caused to important programs across the federal government, and the ways that science and public health have been undermined in both word and deed.\\nThese attacks have not gone unanswered. There has been a flurry of lawsuits to stop the cuts at NIH, NSF, CDC, and other agencies. Universities are standing up to the administration, and thousands are organizing to defend America’s health and the health of people around the globe. But the wreckage is still vast.\\nAs the scope of the damage the president has done becomes clear, scientists are also starting to document and estimate the toll of death and suffering that will now be a part of Trump’s legacy. Several new papers have underscored what is at stake.\\nCurrent Issue\\nIn a paper in one of The Lancet’s family of journals, Jan Hontelez, from Erasmus University Medical College in Rotterdam, and colleagues from around the world estimated the short-term effects of a 90-day interruption in funding for the US’s flagship global HIV/AIDS program, the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Three months might not seem like a long time, but it’s enough to cause tremendous harm. The excess deaths the study predicts under various scenarios in seven sub-Saharan African countries range from 64,000 to 70,000 over the next five years. Given that most PEPFAR sites are now in limbo, we will soon be able to put these predictions to the test.\\nLonger-term estimates of the effects of the cessation of PEPFAR funding are even more grim. Debra ten Brink at the Burnet Institute in Australia and colleagues in The Lancet HIV suggest that anticipated international aid reductions, including the cessation of PEPFAR funding, may lead to 4.4 million to 10.8 million additional new HIV infections by 2030 and between 770,000 to 2.9 million HIV-related deaths in children and adults by 2030.\\nThese estimates are for HIV only. The impact on tuberculosis, malaria, and other health conditions is similarly grisly. Mathematical modeler Brooke Nichols from Boston University has estimates for these additional effects of Trump’s policies at impactcounter.com.\\nBack here in the US, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s secretary of health and human services, continues to play fast and loose with the science of infectious disease and vaccination, undermining key immunization programs and tapping key anti-vaxxers to do his bidding. Most recently, he named David Geier—who does not have a medical degree and has been practicing medicine without a license—to lead a study on vaccines and autism, a supposed relationship that has already been exhaustively debunked. This is in the midst of a large set of measles outbreaks in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana, totaling 819 cases, with another 97 isolated cases in other states across the country.\\nThe implications of the administration’s anti-vaxx agenda could not be more worrying. Last week, a paper Mathew Kiang from Stanford and colleagues published in JAMA warned that even with current vaccination rates, measles is likely to become endemic again, with 851,300 cases of measles occurring over the next 25 years, and with cases of other disease rising as well—such as 190 new cases of rubella, 18 of polio, and eight of diphtheria.\\nIn their study, Kiang and colleagues projected 851 cases of post-measles neurological complications, 170,200 hospitalizations, and 2,550 deaths. This is the status quo. With further reductions in vaccination rates, cases would rise even higher. For instance, a 10 percent reduction in MMR vaccination could lead to 11.1 million new cases of measles. More substantial decreases in vaccination rates risk pushing other childhood infections, such as rubella and polio, back to endemicity. These are diseases we conquered decades ago in this country. Now, we are inviting them back, not through some failure of science or medicine ut through willful mendacity and neglect.\\nTrump and his henchmen—Secretary Kennedy, Secretary of State Marco Rubio (who oversees PEPFAR), Elon Musk, and Project 2025 mastermind and current Office of Management and Budget chief Russell Vought—have blood on their hands. There is a direct line from their decisions to the deaths of men, women, and children by the tens of thousands, and likely into the millions as they continue their long march through the institutions.\\nThe late Bob Rafsky, a comrade from ACT UP, once said this at a political funeral for Mark Fisher, who died of AIDS in 1992. I’ve quoted his words before, and they are, once again, better than those I can muster:\\n[W]hen the living can no longer speak, the dead may speak for them. Mark’s voice is here with us, as is the voice of Pericles, who two millennia ago mourned the Athenian soldiers who didn’t have to die and in whose death he was complicit, but who had the nobility to say that their memorial was the whole earth.\\nLet the whole earth hear us now: We beg, we pray, we DEMAND that this epidemic END.\\nNot just so that we may live, but so that Mark’s soul may rest in peace at last.\\nIn anger and in grief, this fight is not over ‘til all of us are safe.\\nPopular\\n“swipe left below to view more authors”Swipe →\\nAs I write this, I am thinking of Bob, of Mark, of the dead I have mourned over the years. The thousands, the millions who will die because of this administration’s policies have lives; they have names; they have friends and family who love them. Let them not just be figures in scientific papers—let their memorial be the whole earth.\\nHold the powerful to account by supporting The Nation\\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\\nTrump’s catastrophic “Liberation Day” has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called “enemy aliens” are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump’s intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\\nIn just the last month, we’ve published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration’s appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections—like Wisconsin’s recent state Supreme Court race—that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can’t buy our democracy.\\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

A onetime secretary, Brown became homeless in 1986 and began camping on a heating grate on Second Avenue and 65th Street in Manhattan.A year or so passed before she was picked up by city officials, involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital — where she was declared mentally ill — and forcibly given medication. Brown, who was better known as Billie Boggs, was the first homeless person to become the focus of Mayor Edward I. Koch’s newly expanded initiative to address the increasing visibility of homelessness and untreated mental illness on the streets.But, as she would later say in interviews, the city chose “the wrong one.” Unlike the dozen or so other people who would face similar fates, she said she knew her rights, and she would begin exercising them the very next day.What followed was a landmark lawsuit centered on mental health, civil liberties and the involuntary psychiatric treatment of homeless people. “I’m not insane,” Brown would say. “Just homeless.”Before long, Brown was lofted from the pavement to prominence, with a whirlwind of interviews on talk and news programs.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

At Boro, Carrick has overseen a play-off campaign, taken his side to an EFL Cup semi-final, narrowly missed out on the top six last time out, and is making a late play-off push this season Club sources were effusive in their praise for Carrick when asked by Mail Sport, with one labelling him as ¿a true gentleman¿ His personality is something that comes up in conversations and Carrick is extremely popular among Middlesbrough's squad They face a crunch trip to the Sky Blues on Saturday where Carrick, one of the best young managers in the EFL, will be pitted against another Golden Generation midfielder in Frank Lampard.Club sources were effusive in their praise for Carrick when asked by Mail Sport, with one labelling him as ‘a true gentleman’, while his humble nature and general character was hailed.Carrick’s initial impact in the 2022-23 campaign was special given he took over a side that was 21st in the Championship and looking like relegation candidates after Chris Wilder’s sacking.But Carrick guided Boro to 18 wins in 30 games as they rose to fourth until a 1-0 aggregate defeat by Coventry in the play-offs extinguished their promotion hopes.Mail Sport understands Carrick lifted the mood significantly upon his arrival and his demeanour enabled him to get the best out of a struggling side.His personality is something that comes up in conversations and Carrick is extremely popular among Middlesbrough's squad. His own playing record demands instant respect, but the 43-year-old’s way of operating is well-regarded too.Carrick’s innate composure and ability to read the game has been transferred into coaching where he is a calm presence on the touchline.He is now Boro's longest-serving boss since Aitor Karanka and has also implemented an attractive style of play, with one figure claiming the football is among the best they have ever watched at times. He has also implemented an attractive style of play, with one figure claiming the football is among the best they have ever watched at times Sources at Old Trafford are not surprised by Carrick's progress given the impression he made during three-and-a-half-years coaching United¿s first team Several stars, including Bruno Fernandes, still speak fondly of Carrick and loved working with him Sources at Old Trafford are not surprised by Carrick's progress given the impression he made during three-and-a-half-years coaching United’s first team.Several stars, including Bruno Fernandes, still speak fondly of Carrick and loved working with him. He was also known for giving up a significant portion of time to help younger players like Everton's James Garner, who was on the fringes of the first team.The roles of Carrick and Kieran McKenna supporting Solskjaer were often maligned externally, but Mail Sport understands that perception couldn’t be further from the truth and the pair leaned on each other to become more rounded coaches.But it was Carrick’s three-game interim stint that really left an impression amid a turbulent time. During that short tenure which preceded Ralf Rangnick's disastrous spell, United beat Villarreal to secure their place in the Champions League knockout stages, drew with Chelsea, before a 3-2 win over Arsenal concluded his reign.One source labelled it as the most stable period of what was a chaotic season and Carrick's ability to galvanise the squad, show leadership, while also empowering people to work under him left onlookers impressed.The way he handled the media was commendable too and the same source insists they expect Carrick to go to the very top of management one day.In fact, shortly after the Arsenal game, Fernandes told the media: ‘Michael can be a really good manager in the future if he gets that chance. He knows how to speak, he knows a lot of football. For what I have seen he can be a top coach.’Carrick’s managerial record is in stark contrast to the likes of Gary Neville, Paul Scholes and Wayne Rooney - former team-mates who have struggled in the dugout. He has been backed by Fernandes, who said: ¿Michael can be a really good manager in the future if he gets that chance' Carrick¿s managerial record is in stark contrast to the likes of Gary Neville, Paul Scholes and Wayne Rooney - former team-mates who have struggled in the dugout Sources insist it is hard to compare Carrick’s record to those individuals, but he is still spoken of highly at Old Trafford and may return one day.His time at Middlesbrough has been characterised by the development of young players and Morgan Rogers is the standout name.Signed as a talented but raw 21-year-old from Man City for £1.5million in the summer of 2023, Rogers shone under Carrick and is said to view him as an inspiration to his career. Rogers was sold to Aston Villa for £15m within six months and the rest is history.Loan signings like Aaron Ramsey, Cameron Archer, Ben Doak and Ryan Giles have also thrived, while homegrown star Hayden Hackney seems destined for a Premier League move in the near future.But sources are at pains to point out that Carrick is not a one-trick pony, rather he has improved all of the players at his disposal.Jonny Howson is viewed as an example, with the veteran midfielder, 36, shining after being reinvented as a centre back in recent times.There is also the case of Chuba Akpom, once an Arsenal wonderkid tipped for stardom, but he had undergone a nomadic career before Carrick turned up at Middlesbrough.Twenty eight league goals followed in 2022-23 and the 29-year-old was sold to Ajax for £12.2m. Now at Lille, his next best season goal tally is 11. Chuba Akpom was having a nomadic career before he shone under Carrick and earned a move to Ajax Morgan Rogers also shot upwards in his development when playing for Carrick Jonny Howson, 36, is shining after being reinvented as a centre back in recent times There have been some difficult moments for Carrick, not least a tricky start to the 2023-24 season that left Middlesbrough bottom after two points from seven games.A five-game losing streak earlier this year frustrated fans, while four points in their past five matches has been a significant setback for Boro’s play-off push. But popular owner and chairman Steve Gibson has remained steadfast in backing him.Club sources admit a lack of consistency has let Carrick’s side down this season, evidenced by 18 wins and 17 defeats. Yet, given Middlesbrough’s financial situation, his work shouldn't be knocked.The top three in the Championship are described as being in a ‘different stratosphere’ financially, while Sunderland have the benefit of crowds of more than 40,000.Gibson is one of the most loyal chairmen out there, but his financial power means Boro often have to sell to compete. Akpom was a prime example and top scorer Emmanuel Latte Lath was poached by Atlanta United for £22.5m in the winter window. Isaiah Jones and Matt Clarke were similarly sold and there are questions whether that period hindered Carrick.There is also a feeling in some quarters that Boro’s lack of experience hasn’t helped. Howson, alongside Luke Ayling, has spent large spells unavailable while seasoned centre back Darragh Lenihan hasn’t featured since September 2023 due to injury.For now, full attention turns to Coventry, the side Carrick scored his first Premier League goal against, while the lingering feeling of the 2023 play-off defeat remains.Middlesbrough's goal difference is the best out of the five teams battling for the final two play-off spots, but they must beat Coventry and hope Millwall and Blackburn don’t win to secure a top six place. For now, full attention turns to Coventry, the side who ended Boro's play-off dreams in 2023 The crucial clash this weekend is a match-up of the two West Ham academy products Carrick insisted it won¿t be a failure if Middlesbrough miss out, but he has urged his side to have 'belief and hope' Carrick insisted it won’t be a failure if Middlesbrough miss out, but he has urged his side to have 'belief and hope'.‘It's difficult to get in the play-offs,' he said last week. 'It's tough to be there. We were close; we've been stable and consistent. Over the last two years, one was in, one we just missed and now we’re still in with a big chance of getting in there.‘Historically we've seen it and it's there for all of us to know that anything can happen on the last day. We've got to go there believing that we can get what we want from the day never mind the game.’Warnock’s message to promoted teamsThere are few managers quite as iconic as Neil Warnock and we caught up with the 76-year-old shortly after he was recognised at the EFL awards on Sunday night for his ‘Contribution to League Football’.Warnock was in great form and as a veteran of eight promotions in the dugout and stints in the Premier League at four clubs, we asked what Leeds and Burnley can do to avoid following in the footsteps of the previous six promoted teams in coming straight back down to the Championship.‘I think they’ve just got to spend wisely,’ he told us. ‘When Daniel Farke went up with Norwich, they spent £5million. That's all they spent. You can't expect somebody to keep a side up.‘They said, “Look, we can't afford it, we don't want to go into debt”. You can't (not support him), you’ve got to. And Leeds will support him and he’ll show what a good manager he is.’ Neil Warnock insisted Burnley and Leeds must spend wisely to stay up in the Premier League Warnock, who revealed he has relished his advisory role with Torquay United in the National League South this season, also had some simple advice for up and coming managers Warnock, who revealed he has relished his advisory role with Torquay United in the National League South this season, also had some simple advice for up and coming managers in the modern game.‘Make sure you get a good chairman,’ he added with a smile.The EFL’s set piece kingsLincoln City’s final game of the League One season this Saturday may not have much riding on it given they sit in 11th place, but the Imps are hoping to take one accolade from 2024-25.Michael Skubala’s side top the EFL table for the most goals scored from set-pieces with an impressive 30, five clear of Exeter in second.— ITV Football (@itvfootball) April 22, 2025 Reeco Hackett-Fairchild spots Bolton goalkeeper Nathan Baxter well outside his goal and goes for it, sneaking the ball in off the near post Mail Sport has previously reported how Lincoln have tapped into AI to analyse set pieces and see where they can improve.But another factor showing why their record is no surprise comes after what we learned following Reeco Hackett-Fairchild’s audacious 40–yard free kick against Bolton on Easter Monday when he caught Trotters keeper Nathan Baxter off guard. While it may have looked like a spur of the moment finish, we were told by a source close to the club that it was a pre-planned set piece after a junior analyst spotted Baxter’s aggressive positioning from free kicks ahead of the game.With in depth tips like that and a solid core, it would be no surprise to see Skubala’s men push on for the play-offs in 2025-26.\", 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Carrick thrives at Middlesbrough, praised for management\\nENTITIES: Michael Carrick, Middlesbrough, Manchester United, Sir Alex Ferguson, Frank Lampard, Bruno Fernandes, Morgan Rogers, Chuba Akpom\\nEVENT: Michael Carrick is praised for his managerial success at Middlesbrough, developing players and implementing an attractive style of play, contrasting with the struggles of other former Manchester United players in management.\\nCONTEXT: Carrick's success contrasts with struggles of other former United players.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-02T16:09:34.237Z'}, {'id': 46250, 'sourceId': 12706, 'url': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/college-football/article-14668767/Fans-slam-Charles-Barkley-concerns-Bill-Belichick-Jordon-Hudson.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490', 'title': 'Fans slam Charles Barkley for going public with concerns about Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson', 'publishDate': '2025-05-01T18:43:12.000Z', 'content': '19:43, 01 May 2025, updated\\n19:43, 01 May 2025\\nBy\\nERIC BLUM\\nREAD MORE: Belichick\\'s daughter-in-law slams Jordon Hudson after interview\\nNBA legend Charles Barkley inserting himself into the ongoing saga of Bill Belichick\\'s alarming CBS interview has fans blasting him amid his concerns about the football coach\\'s relationship with 49-year-younger Jordon Hudson.\\xa0Barkley appeared on \\'The Dan Patrick Show\\' on Wednesday and was directly asked about his friend of 30 years and his 24-year-old girlfriend, days after criticism reached a fever pitch about their relationship.\\xa0Since Sunday\\'s airing of the awkward interview, a string of alarming revelations have come out about Hudson.

Mostly, they just have to worry about screaming apparitions, glowing fluids and cursed rings. But each does arrive at Highrook manor with a past to unpack alongside the workings of the house - a life story you can further by completing optional sidequests. And while the premise is fantastical, the emotional arc of The Horror At Highrook does, I think, correspond to that of many family home clear-outs.\\nIt starts off mysterious, enveloping, haunting, but as the rooms empty of possibility, the wonder and torment subside. The task becomes practical and the practicalities recur, as the fundamental linearity of this chapter-based trawl tightens its grip on the impossible geometry. By the fourth time I pieced together a conjuring circle and pierced the veil, I was kind of ready for it to be over. And in the game.\\nSome belated nuts and bolts: The Horror At Highrook is a real-time worker placement RPG with a Victorian fantasy setting inspired by Poe and Lovecraft. The initial draw is the house, a cadaverous slice of masonry that bruises orange, purple and blue as day rolls relentlessly into night. Each room is themed around an upgradeable character attribute – the Machine Room is for Devices, “the ticking clockwork of souls and seasons”, while the Cellar is for Secrets, “that which glints in the shadows, that which hides in the heart”. Each room also contains a character and an activity slot, used to carry out tasks that range from defrosting a graven cartouche to operating a phonograph player. These tasks are always acts of combination: pair cards to unlock a new one, with another crunchy morsel of lore attached.\\nWatch on YouTube\\nThe four characters all have points in different attributes, though there’s some overlap. Doctor Caligar’s knack for Incantations allows her to perform rites in the Chapel, while burly Atticus Hawk’s knowledge of Paths empowers him to snare rabbits on the Clifftops and, perhaps, turn up a trinket or two. Each task requires a certain number of attribute points: if your character doesn’t have enough, you can place a maximum of two support cards in the same room to boost your numbers. These support cards include sheets of chemical formulae, enigmatic toys and magic eyeglasses: some are consumed on use, others are kept and upgraded using scavenged materials, once you unlock the Forge. Characters, meanwhile, level up by taking lessons in the Schoolroom.\\nThe character and item upgrades are carefully synched to the chapter-based story, which is the major way Highrook stands apart from Cultist Simulator. This is no open-ended quagmire of card relationships, spilling out through the quantum substructures, but a procession of tiered unlocks that follow a single core narrative. The relative focus makes the grind required to acquire or reacquire certain cards more prominent - and it’s this, for me, that drags the game down.\\nEach task has a completion time, which cultivates a sense of rhythm – half gacha reward loop and half dripping gutter - as you set characters to work on different aspects of the same objective. Time also passes in the shadowy world beyond the manor. There are regular letters and parcels from a variety of cryptic factions and pseudonyms, and a gazette detailing the wider effects of your occult delvings: shared dreams in the town beneath, and strange figures on the roads.\\nImage credit: Outersloth / Rock Paper Shotgun\\nEach character sheds light on different echelons of the setting, by means of scanty dialogue and occasional pop-up journal entries. Atticus is an orphan from the docks: he takes a dim view of Vitali, the group’s snobby arcane scholar, who perceives Atticus as a hunky lowborn idiot. Astor, your Mecanist, also disapproves of Vitali’s enthusiasm for the occult, though there’s a hidden kinship between her mec(h)anical materialism and Vitali’s understanding of circular dimensions that overlay like sheets of clockwork. Caligar is my favourite, a brash, melancholy figure motivated by her failure to prevent a plague.\\nThere’s a touch of survival sim to it all. Each investigator has a hunger, fatigue, injury and sanity gauge that must be periodically replenished. These material strains intensify as the story advances, but feeding and resting your gang of Gothic ghostbusters is rarely more than a pace-breaking formality, and a slight incentive to be efficient in the absence of an overall story time limit. At worse, it’s a nuisance, cluttering rooms and your card storage tray with slowly rotting consumables. Thankfully, you can make the survival simulation bits less demanding in the settings.\\nThe subsistence element usefully contrasts the cosmically horrible discoveries. There’s something satisfyingly eerie about the fact that the same, mundane combinatory mechanics for, say, brewing moonshine can be used to summon restless spirits. The suggestion is that every humble object has its otherworldly frequency or extension, which can be realised by means of simple yet crafty arithmetic. I like the game’s... unflatness, the depth that somehow crystalises within a two-dimensional playspace, as you transmute cards into cards.\\nI’m a little mixed on the writing, however. The irony of Lovecraft is that, for all his association with frightfully-angled forbidden lore hovering on the verge of comprehension, he is often as mysterious as a thrown brick. Many Lovecraft stories are pulpy popcorn-chewers that pretty much wheel on the Spaghetti Monster from the outset, then flashback to the deciphering of arcane designs on dessicated boxes of pasta. They engross by means of density, what we now call “world-building”, rather than deftness. Aside from confronting and critiquing the bigotry that informs his opus, I think a lot of the better “Lovecraftian” writing essentially resists Lovecraft’s tendency to ham it up, allowing the horrors to remain illegible or immaterial and fragmenting the cyclopean descriptions into loosely networked allusions.\\nImage credit: Outersloth / Rock Paper Shotgun\\nI haven’t read enough Poe to comment on how The Horror At Highrook responds to his stuff, beyond noting the erratic appearance of a raven card (which can be shooed from room to room to help with certain rituals). But I do think the game gives us Lovecraftian fiction at its most and least subtle. At times, the writing is pleasantly terse and fey. I love the Gift of the Bee card, for example, which signals “awe of the simple alchemies of the everyday\". It makes me think of the smaller, pungent finds I made around my own house during the clear-out: the anomalous pebble with “Create” written on it, the doorknob I couldn’t match to a door, the spare links from a lost watchchain, the envelope labelled “open me Ed!!!” with nothing inside.\\nThe game’s larger plot beats are less enticing, however. Partly this is because the characters are quite rickety, with cut-and-dried soap opera motivations, and partly it\\'s because the world-building is too prominent. Indeed, most chapters are about building. Each tends to involve a search for the pieces of a summoning circle or other artefact, which must be reassembled in your nine-square-grid Composer. Once complete, you deploy this Composition to breach the portals and encounter some inhuman being. They proceed to talk at you like, well, a character. Not a force from beyond, not an abyssal derangement, but a person with some colourful deformities, peering through a cloud of glyphs. You’re treated to an account of some arcane realm that may be enjoyably and imaginatively worded, but is also quite… additive. The otherworld is just another world. Sometimes, The Horror At Highrook casts a spell and sometimes, it just spells itself out.\\nAnd sometimes, it’s just about numbers. The game’s combinatory logic is least interesting when it comes to the entwining of plot and upgrade. Typically, you start each chapter without the attribute points you need to uncover or apply the next collection of eldritch McGuffins. Upgrading your characters and their tools often involves figuring out a fresh set of card alchemies, but there’s an element of just repeating what you know. More brazen fluid and shimmering fragments for the Forge. More inspiring books and condensed Insight for the Schoolroom. The more the game asks you to go through the motions, the more you notice the ways in which it keeps you on track, and stops you progressing too far per chapter. Many cards have a limit on how many you can draw. Certain useful tools disintegrate once they’ve served their purpose within the plot.\\nImage credit: Outersloth / Rock Paper Shotgun\\nVariety is created principally by threats. As you reconstruct the manor’s tragedy, re-enacting the grand ambitions and helpless curiosity that bred its downfall, the more you have to deal with meddlers from the Beyond. Spooks and anomalies take possession of activity slots, blocking progress and injuring or maddening characters nearby. The process of dealing with them is broadly the same as making soup in the Kitchen, however: match your character and support card stats to the number on the monster’s collar. Again, I like that the same card mechanics serve spiritual or temporal purposes, but there are definitely moments when this leads to bathos, rather than horror.\\nThe Horror At Highrook will please you if you like Cultist Simulator but find it too ambiguous, or if you don’t want to play it in light of the allegations about its creator. It will displease you if you liked Cultist Simulator and were hoping for something comparably elusive and bottomless. It might just about meet your needs if you\\'re keen on cosmic horror, and don\\'t mind a bit of flavourful drudgery.\\nGiven the torrid circumstances in which I started playing it, I’m quite glad that I’m cool on the game. If it had been some ravaging psychological journey with all sorts of unlikely combos to decipher, I think I would have had to play it in bursts, rather than cramming it into the first three days of this week. It’s certainly touched a few of the nerves exposed by my house clearout, but ultimately, it reminds me just as much of the closing day or two when I went from room to room mindlessly slapping Post-It notes on boxes, and having tiny meltdowns about bottles of shampoo I couldn’t rehome.', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Review: The Horror At Highrook, cosmic horror RPG\\nENTITIES: The Horror At Highrook, Poe, Lovecraft, Outersloth, Cultist Simulator\\nEVENT: A review of the cosmic horror tabletop RPG 'The Horror At Highrook' finds it enjoyable but somewhat repetitive, comparing it to 'Cultist Simulator' and noting its Lovecraftian influences.\\nCONTEXT: The game's mechanics and writing have both strengths and weaknesses.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-02T16:09:34.237Z'}, {'id': 46276, 'sourceId': 12709, 'url': 'https://metro.co.uk/2025/05/01/rio-ferdinand-singles-sensational-man-utd-star-win-athletic-bilbao-23011926/', 'title': \"Rio Ferdinand singles out 'sensational' Man Utd star after win over Athletic Bilbao\", 'publishDate': '2025-05-01T21:02:09.000Z', 'content': 'Casemiro shone in Manchester United’s victory over Athletic Bilbao (Picture: Getty)\\nRio Ferdinand singled out Casemiro for praise during Manchester United’s 3-0 win over ten-man Athletic Bilbao, applauding the midfielder for ‘coming to the fore’ when his club needed him most in the Europa League semi-final first leg.\\nCasemiro headed home on the half-hour mark after some superb wing-play from an unlikely source in Harry Maguire to break the deadlock at a shellshocked San Mames Barria.\\nThe visitors were much the better side in the first half and deservedly doubled their lead just seven minutes later, with Bruno Fernandes converting from the penalty spot after Dani Vivian’s sending off for a foul on Rasmus Hojlund.\\nFernandes finished cooly past Julen Agirrezabala to grab his second of the evening – and seventh in this year’s competition – on the stroke of half-time, capping off a dream opening 45 minutes for Ruben Amorim’s men.\\nThe Red Devils held firm in the second period to come away from Bilbao with an imperious three-goal advantage and put one foot in the final ahead of next week’s return leg at Old Trafford.\\nGet personalised updates on Manchester United every day\\nWake up to find news on your club in your inbox every morning with Metro’s Football Newsletter.\\nSign up to our newsletter and then select your team in the link so we can send you football news tailored to you.\\nCasemiro has blown hot and cold across his three-year spell with United but Ferdinand waxed lyrical about the Brazilian’s display, in what was his 112th game in European football.\\n‘I don’t think Casemiro has put a foot wrong.

You could imagine being Jonah or Pinocchio about to be swallowed by a whale.” (Eddy Frankel)Olafur Eliasson unveils a setting sun (2003)Olafur Eliasson, artist“When I was approached about doing something, I immediately thought about the relationship British people have with the weather. Someone can say ‘I like the rain’ and someone else can say ‘I prefer the sun’ and they can still be friends. Whereas if this was football teams, they couldn’t even be in the same pub! I was also interested in Turner and Constable and the tradition of depicting the weather in British watercolours. My idea was to recreate a setting sun, where you see half of it in the sky and the other half reflected in the sea. We used very thin aluminium mirrors to achieve this. Compared to some of my other projects, it wasn’t technically difficult. I did not anticipate the social spectacle it became. I thought people would be looking with their eyes but instead they looked with their bodies: lying down, rolling around, making shapes in the giant reflection. The BBC even reported the weather from Tate Modern!” (Tim Jonze)Doris Salcedo puts a long crack in the floor (2007) Doris Salcedo, artist“The memory of this work is painful. It was, and still is, a wound inflicted on the Turbine Hall. It was an excruciating gesture for all the parties involved – Tate director Nicholas Serota’s job was on the line because of the nature of the piece. As the first artist from the global south invited to do a Turbine Hall commission, it was essential to raise our voices and respond to colonial history – it felt as serious as life or death to me. It represents the division in our world, which unfortunately only keeps growing.” (Charlotte Jansen)An enormous salad is mixed with a rake (2008)Catherine Wood, curator“In the 1960s, Alison Knowles, who was a founding member of the Fluxus movement, had done an iteration of this piece at the ICA, tossing a salad in a pickle barrel. She proposed to supersize it. First there was a funny visit to nearby Borough Market, where Alison was like: “I’ll have all your lettuces.” Also tomatoes, cucumbers – she wanted it to taste good. During the event, she was quite performative, announcing what was happening. Chefs from the museum chopped the veg into crates on the bridge, then tossed it down on to a tarpaulin on the Turbine Hall floor and poured down the dressing from a jug. There was a big crowd, 500, maybe 1,000, people. Everyone cheered. She used a garden rake to mix it and people got little bowls to eat from. The museum was built on the principles of what those artists in the 1960s did with participation and access and play. So this was a thrill.” (DBS)Nan Goldin does The Ballad of Sexual Dependency (2008)Patrick Wolf, musician“I had just moved into a flat opposite the Tate Modern, when I got the call from Nan. She had given me a copy of her book, The Ballad of Sexual Dependency, four years earlier. It felt like such an honour to be asked to make the first ever soundtrack to this visual diary. Nan was very trusting. She knew I’d respect the work. And I knew where it was coming from. When I was a teenager, I was part of a crowd in London that was similarly disturbed by what they had experienced, either through addiction or death. At the beginning, Nan gave a speech. The piece started with a tubular bell and a double bass, and a sense of silence took over, a weight came over the room. We had orchestral timpani and a string quartet. I played the harpsichord. At the end, Nan was very emotional and crying. As with everything at the Tate, there’s a party afterwards, which felt quite strange after something so heavy. I remember walking with Nan outside at the back of the Tate and us just saying thank you to each other.” (DBS)Tania Bruguera kettles people with horses (2008)Catherine Wood, curator“Tania always said this performance piece – which was an idea she had never realised – would be like a gunshot, a surprise. Our health and safety and security officer at the time had a contact in the Met. Tania asked the officers to perform six crowd-control exercises normally used in riots. At first, they were friendly to the crowd but she asked them to stop. The horses’ hooves clacking on the concrete was echoing around the space and when the police got into their role, you heard them barking instructions. The crowd went quite quiet. I was there with my six-month-old son. People were both complying and marvelling at the strange, surreal spectacle. The horses dumped on the floor, which was great as well. There is a tradition in art of doing variations of Piero Manzoni’s Merde d’artiste.” (DBS)Picture of Brooke Shields naked removed by police (2009)Catherine Wood, curator“Richard Prince’s Spiritual America had been shown before and had become iconic and familiar in the art world. By reclaiming Gary Gross’s photograph of a naked, 10-year-old Brooke Shields, Prince was clearly referencing the way capitalism sexualises young women and girls. We didn’t question the acceptability of showing it. We had also been in touch with Brooke Shields. She had a conflicting relationship with the image, but after working with Prince on a follow-up had become reconciled to it. Nobody from the public lodged a complaint, but we were advised by the police that we had to take it down or our director could be liable for prosecution under the child protection act. At the time, we were shocked. We thought the police were being very literal. But it does all look very different today. The mass access that Tate Modern gives to art is different even to New York museums, where people have to pay to enter. When you step outside the protected zone of the art world, who read the artist’s “move” through his conceptual intent, the image looks very different. These days, we have a much more robust process of assessing sensitive content. Today, we would know what is and isn’t possible long before the work ended up on the gallery wall.” (TJ)Bodyspacemotionthings causes joy – and injuries (2009)Kathy Noble, former interdisciplinary curator“I’d come across these images of an installation Robert Morris made in Tate Britain in 1971. They were of people climbing and balancing on plywood sculptures and were really surprising. Back then, museums were a place of reverence, almost cathedral-like. When the public were invited to interact with the objects, they didn’t quite know how to go about it: there were some injuries and the show closed after four days. We wondered whether Tate Modern had changed the way people behaved around art. We worked closely with Robert to make it safer and he gave the 2009 version the title Bodyspacemotionsthings – the original used unfinished pieces of wood whereas we had plywood that had been treated and objects made of rubber. There were no splinters this time. The press did report that some people got injured but I think that was sensationalised. I only remember a couple of minor incidents. In general people were excited. It helped write a new narrative about how art can be playful and joyous. And it was so popular that this time around it was extended from four days to a whole month.” (TJ)Ai Weiwei’s Sunflower Seeds is halted (2010)Ai Weiwei, artist“Sunflower Seeds is one of the most complicated projects I have ever undertaken. It was created by 1,600 women artisans over a period of two full years. It reflects China’s history, culture and exceptional artisan skills. It also reflects the backdrop of globalisation – and China involving its entire population within this process. The artwork is not merely a visual piece highlighting quantity and complexity, but also represents the political reality and socialist society in which I grew up. I had hoped visitors could walk across 100m sunflower seeds, their physical contact reminiscent of walking on a beach. I did not anticipate that the dust produced by the seeds underfoot would be harmful to health. As a result, its participatory nature was halted, transforming it into a purely visual experience. This came as a shock to me. The impact was that my thinking about the relationship between artworks and sociopolitical movements intensified. I believe art arises from an individual’s personal reflection and cannot be separated from engagement with society.” (EM)Tacita Dean blows up celluloid (2011)Tacita Dean, artist“I thought a Turbine Hall commission was one thing I would never be asked to do, because my work is relatively small. Nothing I make is ever about the spectacular. The piece, titled FILM, was all done very quickly with a completely new experimental system, projecting images on to a 13-metre-tall monolith – exactly when the medium of film itself was under such threat. You have no idea of the drama. We worked all through the night. Steve Farman, the negative cutter, drove from London to Amsterdam and back to recut the film and handed it in at the back door, less than 48 hours before the opening. I remember saying in an event that film is not dead: it will only die if it gets murdered. My crew at the time were all under 25 and it blew their minds.”Yayoi Kusama brings Infinity Mirror Rooms to the UK (2012)Frances Morris, then curator“This was a very important show for Kusama, not only because of that glorious final moment – with the biggest Infinity Room she had made to date. She afforded us amazing access to her archive, and to her secret home in Tokyo. We made lots of discoveries. I have to say, though, that it was hard to persuade Kusama to do the show. I went to visit her in Tokyo and promised it would make her more famous than her old friend Donald Judd. I think it delivered!”Mark Rothko’s Black on Maroon is vandalised (2012)Patricia Smithen, repair project leader“When I heard the news, I was on site within the hour. Black ink had been drawn on the lower right corner of Rothko’s Black on Maroon and it had penetrated quickly. It turned out to be graffiti ink – designed to be quick drying, highly staining and permanent. The project took 18 months while conservation scientist Bronwyn Ormsby rallied expertise from across the field. The artwork is made up of very thin layers of paint and glazes: most solvents which could remove the ink would also affect Rothko’s paint. About 80 different solvent combinations were tried out on test surfaces over nine months. Rachel Barker, the painting conservator, did the actual treatment. She combined two solvents, layered, and applied them through absorbent fabric. When the ink was pulled out and we could see the original paint again, there were cheers! After a final retouching with reversible paint under the gallery lights, we asked staff if they could see the damage. Nobody was able to spot it. It was a wonderful moment, but bittersweet. The painting looks perfect in the gallery, but some black ink remains within the lower paint layers and stains the canvas on the reverse. This damage is for ever and it still haunts me.” (TJ)Mel Evans, founding member Liberate Tate“We wanted to highlight what BP had consistently failed at: clean renewables. A farmer in Wales gave us an old turbine blade: 16.5 metres long and 1.5 tonnes in weight. We had to cut it in three to transport it. We spent a couple of weeks polishing it. We wanted it to be beautiful, to lie on the floor of the gallery like a beached whale. There was a conversation in the group about standing it on its end, but a few of us said that was much too phallic. We walked with it from the Occupy camp at St Paul’s Cathedral, across the Millennium Bridge. One of the security guards laid down in front of it to stop us coming in, so I sat down with him and spoke very gently, saying: “This is happening.” He stood up. We assembled the blade. There were 75 performers. We held hands in a ring around it. All the gallery-goers stood and applauded. It felt incredible, electric.” (DBS)Tino Sehgal’s storytellers chat to visitors (2012)Tino Sehgal, artist“In 2012, London was having a great moment. And the Turbine Hall was the biggest and most unusual art space. I hadn’t worked with a large group of people before, so I was interested in what I could do with a crowd. In total, 300 people participated over three months. I created ‘human swarm patterns’ by having them follow sets of rules or games. They’d all move from one side to the next, or all walk backwards or sing a song together. I also gave them six questions – things like, ‘When did you have a sense of arrival?’ – and they chose one for their interactions with visitors. The anonymity made these interactions surprisingly intimate. They’d come to me afterwards if something special happened.” (DBS)Kraftwerk play eight live gigs (2013)Emil Schult, Kraftwerk’s artistic collaborator“To accompany these performances, we redid some of the early videos that had been made in the 1970s for the band’s stage show, but we also made new ones. The video for Autobahn was an animation, based on the painting I did for the sleeve of the original 1974 album. My input was on the artistic side: the colours, the shape of the industrial landscapes, the streamlining of the Trans Europe Express engine, the movement of waves and so on. For almost 50 years now, I have been interested in animation, artificial life and artificial intelligence. So to see my work come alive was very much appreciated.” (TJ)Matisse’s late works break Tate records (2014)Nicholas Cullinan, then curator of International Modern Art“When I proposed the show in 2009, Nicholas Serota and I had just curated the Cy Twombly exhibition and had been visiting Cy in his studio on a regular basis, in what turned out to be the last years of his life. That, and the fact that Tate Modern had never done a Matisse show, was our inspiration: often when artists have a sense of their mortality, they respond by making the best work they’ve ever made. We were pleasantly surprised at how many loans we got: people understood this was a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see all the works together. With over half a million visitors, it is still the most visited show the Tate, not just Tate Modern, has ever had.” (DBS)New viewing platform prompts legal battle (2016)John O’Mara, project architect of the Switch House for Herzog & de Meuron“Our idea for the top of the new Switch House was to create an elevated public space with thrilling 360-degree views across the city. A developer was planning to build towers of luxury flats next door, so we did these gymnastic moves with our design to protect their views of the river. They were very supportive of the project, so it was a real shock when residents started complaining about people looking into their flats from the terrace, about 30 metres away. No one had anticipated it being a problem, but they took Tate to court. The first ruling found in favour of Tate, but a subsequent supreme court ruling saw the southern side of the terrace closed off. It’s a real shame, as a lot of people really liked that view.” (Oliver Wainwright)Shoair Mavlian, curator of The Radical Eye: Modernist Photography from the Sir Elton John Collection“It was incredible to have access to Sir Elton John’s collection and put the vintage prints on public display – everything in the show was printed before 1950. Sir Elton has an encyclopaedic knowledge of the history of photography and a real highlight was when he recorded an audio guide, giving his perspective on dozens of the photos. You could really hear his passion for photography.” (CJ)Soul of a Nation starts something big (2017)Zoé Whitley, co-curator of Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power“This show was about the irreducibility of what it means to be Black. It exceeded all expectations in terms of people who came, who felt seen, who wanted to engage with it, including Jay-Z, Naomie Harris, John Legend and Sampha. All the works posed the question: what is Black art? It gave no single answer. This was the start of something that keeps getting bigger. And it was celebratory for so many artists, many of whom are no longer with us.” (CJ)Work by gallery staff goes on display (2018)Chris Daniels, artist“There had been talk about a staff exhibition for a while, and I applied after I saw it on Tatenet, the intranet for staff. Tate is full of artists who work there to pay the rent, but also spend all their spare time in the studio, and still produce incredible art despite the restrictions of a day job. I was a Tate Membership recruiter, walking up to people and trying to encourage them to join up, but I also made, and still make, paintings. It was a fantastic opportunity: the sheer numbers of people visiting Tate Modern meant the audience was much bigger than any standard exhibition. And it meant I could add “showing at Tate Modern” to my bio!” (EF)Kara Walker builds a fountain full of sharks (2019)Kara Walker, artist“The process began with not wanting to do Louise Bourgeois or Doris Salcedo wrong. I had those artists’ incredible Turbine Hall interventions in mind when I embarked on this piece. Then I spent six months or so ramming my head against the wall. That was until one visit to London, when I snapped a few pictures of the Queen Victoria memorial from the taxi on my way to Heathrow. I thought, ‘Wow, that’s the kind of pomposity I like!’ The symbolic language, the overblown figuration, a little too big for its britches. That’s my language. Fons Americanus, my fountain, was a commentary on empire and my place within it, which is as an outsider, a rebel. The American invader.” (EM)Anicka Yi’s robotic jellyfish take flight (2021)Anicka Yi, artist“In Love With the World reimagined the Turbine Hall as an aquarium of machines, where airborne lifeforms – “aerobes” – drift through the air like jellyfish through water. It was essential to me that these machines didn’t merely occupy the space, but sensed it, responded to it, and participated in it. A central concern was to challenge the cognitive hierarchy that places disembodied intelligence – the mind extracted from the body – at the top. Instead, I’m interested in artificial physical intelligence – intelligence as something rooted in corporeality, sensory perception and ecological embeddedness. I wanted the aerobes to be less robotic in the traditional sense and more like a new species, engaged in a multispecies symbiosis with us and the atmosphere we share. Each aerobe is kept aloft by helium envelopes and guided by a compact system of carbon-fibre actuators, 3D-printed components and custom-built control boards. Key to their long-term operation is the Battery Pond. Aerobes return there autonomously when their batteries run low, while technicians perform regular check-ins. If an aerobe were to experience a technical issue, its helium structure ensures a slow, controlled descent – not a crash, but a soft settling. They avoid one another, respond to heat signatures from the crowd below, and navigate invisible trails left by other aerobes – forming a choreography that prevents collisions and encourages responsive movement. Rather than building flawless machines, the aim was to create a self-regulating ecosystem.” (EM)Cézanne shows everyone how it’s done (2023)Peter Doig, painter“Picasso said, ‘He was my one and only master. It was the same for all of us. He was like our father. He was the one who protected us.’ That still seems to ring true for artists today, even after all the new territory that has seemingly been mined in painting since Cézanne’s death. The Tate show displayed all of his mastery as well as his awkwardness and irreverence. For painters today I think he still holds the secrets to everything one can learn – from bad to good painting and drawing, economy, restraint and his lack of flash. Cézanne never shows off. I am continually drawn to his details. You can learn everything you need to know about painting just from his flumes of smoke.” (EF)Tracey Emin given major retrospective (opens 2026)Tracey Emin, artist“I am really happy that I didn’t die and I am around to see this exhibition. I was there at the opening of the Tate Modern in 2000 – and at the time it felt like the most exciting thing that could ever possibly happen to London. You judge a city by its art.” (DBS)', 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Tate Modern marks 25 years with highlights\\nENTITIES: Louise Bourgeois, Anish Kapoor, Olafur Eliasson, Doris Salcedo, Alison Knowles, Nan Goldin, Tania Bruguera, Richard Prince, Robert Morris, Ai Weiwei, Tacita Dean, Yayoi Kusama, Mark Rothko, Mel Evans, Tino Sehgal, Kraftwerk, Emil Schult, Nicholas Cullinan, John O’Mara, Shoair Mavlian, Elton John, Zoé Whitley, Chris Daniels, Kara Walker, Anicka Yi, Peter Doig, Cézanne, Tracey Emin\\nEVENT: Tate Modern celebrates its 25th anniversary by revisiting memorable installations and exhibitions, including works by Louise Bourgeois, Anish Kapoor, Olafur Eliasson, and others, reflecting on the museum's impact on art and society.\\nCONTEXT: Tate Modern reflects on 25 years of iconic art.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-02T16:09:34.237Z'}, {'id': 41416, 'sourceId': 12436, 'url': 'https://www.popsci.com/science/what-makes-smoke-black-or-white/', 'title': 'What makes smoke black versus white?', 'publishDate': '2025-05-01T13:30:00.000Z', 'content': 'Get the Popular Science daily newsletter💡\\nBeginning on May 7, billions of people around they world will have their eyes fixed upon a single chimney. As per tradition, the 135 cardinal-electors gathering at the Vatican’s Sistine Chapel to select the next pope will use smoke signals to tell the world whether or not they have come to a decision. Black smoke indicates that votes have been cast, but no candidate has received the two-thirds majority required to be elected pope. White smoke means that a new pope has been selected.\\nThe color of smoke is also a key element to watch during a fire. Smoke’s hue can tell firefighters critical details about the properties of the fire itself and be used to better understand it’s behavior–and save lives.\\n“When reading smoke, the color matters,” Glenn Corbett, a fire protection engineer and associate professor of fire science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City tells Popular Science. “It tells you what is burning.”\\n[ Related: Pope Francis’ Climate Change Epiphany. ]\\nBlack smoke tends to be present if heavy fuels are being burned, such as during an oil spill or vehicle fire. It can also mean that plenty of synthetic materials burning, which can signal that the fumes are particularly toxic.\\n“When you see a lot of black smoke, you can guarantee that there’s a lot of carbon involved,” says Corbett. “That’s what gives you the black, opaqueness to a smoke. When you have particular types of fires where the smoke is really black, it’s really powerful in the sense that it’s ripping out of the building at a very fast rate.”\\nDuring the two-day-long conclave in 2013, a mixture of potassium perchlorate, anthracene (a component in coal tar), and sulfur was used to make the black smoke.\\nThis smoke signal system is also relatively new, in Catholic Church-terms. According to historian Frederic Baumgartner, the tradition only goes back to 1903.\\xa0Cardinals in 2013 also did not burn the ballots themselves to create the smoke seen from the chimney–which has been done in the past.\\nBlack smoke rises from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City, on March 13, 2013. CREDIT: Michael Kappeler/picture alliance via Getty Images. picture alliance\\nWhat makes smoke white?\\nWhen the chimney atop the Sistine Chapel spouts white smoke, it means that the Catholic Church officially has a new pope. White smoke tends to be a sign that a fire is creating gas or water vapor. It could be an indicator that a fire is either just starting to burn or dying out.\\n“The key ingredients are what oxidizers [are] in there. Oxidizers accelerate the combustion process,” says Corbett. “If you introduce oxygen into a fire, it accelerates it exponentially. That’s the key about an oxidizer. It speeds up the process and you get better combustion because of it.”\\nPreparing the conclave after the death of John XXIII and especially the famous stove in which are burned the ballot papers and whose smokes announce the election or not of a new Pope in Rome, Italy, on June 11, 1963.

The conclave that elected the late Pope Francis used a combination of potassium chlorate, lactose, and chloroform resin to create white smoke, which appears to have solved the visibility problem.\\nWhat can smoke tell firefighters?\\nSmoke itself is deadly and smoke inhalation is the leading cause of injury and death during fires. It is the byproduct produced when a material is burned, but not completely consumed by the fire. The three big components of smoke are aerosols, gases (like carbon monoxide), and particulates.\\nFirefighters have to learn to “read” smoke, in order to interpret what the fire is doing from as safe a distance as possible. This way, fire chiefs and incident safety officers can make the best decisions possible about when and where to send in their crew.\\n“We use color of smoke, velocity of smoke or how quickly it is being pumped out of a building, and angriness of smoke, to tell us what we’re going into,” says Corbett.\\nAngry smoke typically occurs before a flashover–a very rapid and often violent phase of fire development. The contents of an enclosed space can all ignite at the same time due to intense heat build-up. Monitoring the smoke’s anger can help keep firefighters out of harm’s way.\\n“We [also] use colors also to establish if we’re controlling a fire,” says Corbett. “We watch the colors of\\xa0smoke, which might relate back to the conclave because we’re [also] watching the color.”\\nWhat times should viewers look for smoke during the conclave?\\nAccording to America–a monthly magazine published by the Jesuits of the United States–just after 7 p.m. local time on May 7 isthe best time to be in St. Peter’s Square or tune into any livestreams. During the following days, 10:30 a.m., noon, 5:30 p.m., and just after 7 p.m. are also potential chances to see the smoke in real time.\\n“Predicting when the smoke will rise from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel is not an exact science, ” writes Cindy Wooden of Catholic News Service. “The time needed for the cardinals’ prayers, discussions and vote counting can vary.”\\nThis story is part of Popular Science’s Ask Us Anything series, where we answer your most outlandish, mind-burning questions, from the ordinary to the off-the-wall.

The artificial intelligence chatbot system was claiming that it was “waking up” and having inner experiences. This was not the first time AI chatbots have claimed to be conscious, and it will not be the last. While this may merely seem amusing, the concern is important. The conversational abilities of AI chatbots, including emulating human thoughts and feelings, are quite impressive, so much so that philosophers, AI experts and policy makers are investigating the question of whether chatbots could be conscious—whether it feels like something, from the inside, to be them.As the director of the Center for the Future Mind, a center that studies human and machine intelligence, and the former Blumberg NASA/Library of Congress Chair in Astrobiology, I have long studied the future of intelligence, especially by investigating what, if anything, might make alien forms of intelligence, including AIs, conscious, and what consciousness is in the first place. So it is natural for people to ask me whether the latest ChatGPT, Claude or Gemini chatbot models are conscious.My answer is that these chatbots’ claims of consciousness say nothing, one way or the other. Still, we must approach the issue with great care, taking the question of AI consciousness seriously, especially in the context of AIs with biological components. As we move forward, it will be crucial to separate intelligence from consciousness and to develop a richer understanding of how to detect consciousness in AIs.On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.AI chatbots have been trained on massive amounts of human data that includes scientific research on consciousness, Internet posts saturated with our hopes, dreams and anxieties, and even the discussions many of us are having about conscious AI. Having crawled so much human data, chatbots encode sophisticated conceptual maps that mirror our own. Concepts, from simple ones like “dog” to abstract ones like “consciousness,” are represented in AI chatbots through complex mathematical structures of weighted connections. These connections can mirror human belief systems, including those involving consciousness and emotion.Chatbots may sometimes act conscious, but are they? To appreciate how urgent this issue may become, fast-forward to a time in which AI grows so smart that it routinely makes scientific discoveries humans did not make, delivers accurate scientific predictions with reasoning that even teams of experts find hard to follow, and potentially displaces humans across a range of professions. If that happens, our uncertainty will come back to haunt us. We need to mull over this issue carefully now.Why not just simply say: “If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it’s a duck”? The trouble is that prematurely assuming a chatbot is conscious could lead to all sorts of problems. It could cause users of these AI systems to risk emotional engagement in a fundamentally one-sided relationship with something unable to reciprocate feelings. Worse, we could mistakenly grant chatbots moral and legal standing typically reserved for conscious beings. For instance, in situations in which we have to balance the moral value of an AI versus that of a human, we might in some cases balance them equally, for we have decided that they are both conscious. In other cases, we might even sacrifice a human to save two AIs.Further, if we allow someone who built the AI to say that their product is conscious and it ends up harming someone, they could simply throw their hands up and exclaim: “It made up its own mind—I am not responsible.” Accepting claims of consciousness could shield individuals and companies from legal and/or ethical responsibility for the impact of the technologies they develop. For all these reasons it is imperative we strive for more certainty on AI consciousness.A good way to think about these AI systems is that they behave like a “crowdsourced neocortex”—a system with intelligence that emerges from training on extraordinary amounts of human data, enabling it to effectively mimic the thought patterns of humans. That is, as chatbots grow more and more sophisticated, their internal workings come to mirror those of the human populations whose data they assimilated. Rather than mimicking the concepts of a single person, though, they mirror the larger group of humans whose information about human thought and consciousness was included in the training data, as well as the larger body of research and philosophical work on consciousness. The complex conceptual map chatbots encode, as they grow more sophisticated, is something specialists are only now beginning to understand.Crucially, this emerging capability to emulate human thought–like behaviors does not confirm or discredit chatbot consciousness. Instead, the crowdsourced neocortex account explains why chatbots assert consciousness and related emotional states without genuinely experiencing them. In other words, it provides what philosophers call an “error theory”—an explanation of why we erroneously conclude the chatbots have inner lives.The upshot is that if you are using a chatbot, remember that their sophisticated linguistic abilities do not mean they are conscious. I suspect that AIs will continue to grow more intelligent and capable, perhaps eventually outthinking humans in many respects. But their advancing intelligence, including their ability to emulate human emotion, does not mean that they feel—and this is key to consciousness. As I stressed in my book Artificial You (2019), intelligence and consciousness can come apart.I’m not saying that all forms of AI will forever lack consciousness. I’ve advocated a “wait and see” approach, holding that the matter demands careful empirical and philosophical investigation. Because chatbots can claim they are conscious, behaving with linguistic intelligence, they have a “marker” for consciousness—a trait requiring further investigation that is not, alone, sufficient for judging them to be conscious.I’ve written previously about the most important step: developing reliable tests for AI consciousness. Ideally, we could build the tests with an understanding of human consciousness in hand and simply see if AI has these key features. But things are not so easy. For one thing, scientists vehemently disagree about why we are conscious. Some locate it in high-level activity like dynamic coordination between certain regions of the brain; others, like me, locate it at the smallest layer of reality—in the quantum fabric of spacetime itself. For another, even if we have a full picture of the scientific basis of consciousness in the nervous system, this understanding may lead us to simply apply that formula to AI. But AI, with its lack of brain and nervous system, might display another form of consciousness that we would miss. So we would mistakenly assume that the only form of consciousness out there is one that mirrors our own.We need tests that assume these questions are open. Otherwise, we risk getting mired in vexing debates about the nature of consciousness without ever addressing concrete ways of testing AIs. For example, we should look at tests involving measures of integrated information—a measure of how components of a system combine information—as well as my AI consciousness test (ACT test). Developed with Edwin Turner of Princeton, ACT offers a battery of natural language questions that can be given to chatbots to determine if they have experience when they are at the R & D stage, before they are trained on information about consciousness.Now let us return to that hypothetical time in which an AI chatbot, trained on all our data, outthinks humans. When we face that point, we must bear in mind that the system’s behaviors do not tell us one way or another if it is conscious because it is operating under an “error theory.” So we must separate intelligence from consciousness, realizing that the two things can come apart. Indeed, an AI chatbot could even exhibit novel discoveries about the basis of consciousness in humans—as I believe they will—but it would not mean that that particular AI felt anything. But if we prompt it right, it might point us in the direction of other kinds of AI that are.Given that humans and nonhuman animals exhibit consciousness, we have to take very seriously the possibility that future machines built with biological components might also possess consciousness. Further, “neuromorphic” AIs—systems more directly modeled after the brain, including with relatively precise analogues to brain regions responsible for consciousness—must be taken particularly seriously as candidates for consciousness, whether they are made with biological components or not.This underscores the import of assessing questions of AI consciousness on a case-by-case basis and not overgeneralizing from results involving a single type of AI, such as one of today’s chatbots. We must develop a range of tests to apply to the different cases that will arise, and we must still strive for a better scientific and philosophical understanding of consciousness itself.This is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American.\", 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: AI Chatbots: Consciousness Claims Require Careful Scrutiny\\nENTITIES: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Center for the Future Mind, Edwin Turner\\nEVENT: The article discusses the question of whether AI chatbots could be conscious and the implications of assuming they are, advocating for careful testing and investigation rather than accepting claims of consciousness at face value.\\nCONTEXT: AI consciousness claims require careful investigation and testing.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-02T16:09:34.237Z'}, {'id': 39700, 'sourceId': 882, 'url': 'https://news.sky.com/story/north-korean-hacker-who-tried-to-get-a-job-at-us-tech-company-caught-red-handed-heres-how-13359599', 'title': \"North Korean hacker who tried to get a job at US tech company caught red-handed -

And in the list of priorities, his interests and the interests of having the government stable are the first ones, and not the hostages.\"Many of those signing recent letters are, like Yatom, long time critics of the prime minister. Some were involved in the anti-government protests that preceded the outbreak of war on 7 October 2023 following Hamas\\'s attack on Israel. But Yatom says that\\'s not why he decided to speak out.\"I signed my name and I am participating in the demonstrations not because of any political reason, but because of a national reason,\" he said.\"I am highly concerned that my country is going to lose its way.\"Ex-spy boss Danny Yatom is among the thousands to have signed letters demanding an end to the Gaza warThe first open letter to be published, in early April, was signed by 1,000 air force reservists and retirees.\"The continuation of the war does not contribute to any of its declared goals,\" they wrote, \"and will lead to the death of the hostages\".The signatories urged Israelis to follow their lead before time ran out on the estimated 24 hostages still thought to be alive in Gaza.\"Every day that passes is further risking their lives. Every moment of hesitation is a crying shame.\"In the weeks since, similar letters have appeared from almost every branch of the military, including elite fighting and intelligence units, along with a number of decorated commanders.More than 12,000 signatures all.After 7 October, hundreds of thousands of Israeli reservists answered the call, eager to serve.But now, more and more are refusing, with reports suggesting that reserve attendance has dropped to as little as 50-60%.For a military that depends heavily on reservists to fight its wars, it\\'s a looming crisis on a scale not seen since Israel\\'s first Lebanon war in 1982.In a leafy Jerusalem park, I met \"Yoav\" (not his real name), an infantry reservist who asked not to be identified.Yoav served in Gaza last summer but said he wouldn\\'t do it again.\"I had the feeling that I needed to go to help my brothers and sisters,\" he told me.\"I believed I was doing something good. Complicated but good. But now, I don\\'t see it in the same way anymore.\"The government\\'s determination to keep fighting Hamas, while hostages risk death in the tunnels of Gaza, Yoav said, was misplaced.\"We are very strong and we can beat Hamas, but it\\'s not about beating Hamas,\" he said. \"It\\'s about losing our country.\"Getty ImagesRecent polls in Israel indicate widespread public support for a new ceasefire and hostage release dealDuring his time in Gaza, Yoav told me, he tried to be \"the best moral soldier that a man can be\".But the longer the war goes on, critics say, the harder it is for Israel to claim, as government officials often do, that its military is the most moral army in the world.In a recent column in the left of centre newspaper Haaretz, the retired general Amiram Levin said it was time for soldiers – starting with senior commanders - to think about disobeying orders.\"The risk of being dragged into war crimes and suffering a fatal blow to the Israel Defense Forces and our social ethos,\" he wrote, \"make it impossible to stand idly by\".Some of Israel\\'s critics, including those who have brought cases before the International Criminal Court and International Court of Justice, argue that such lines have already been crossed.Netanyahu has lashed out at the protesters, dismissing their concerns as \"propaganda lies\", spread by \"a small handful of fringe elements – loud, anarchist and disconnected pensioners, most of whom haven\\'t served in years\".But polls suggest the protest letters reflect a growing public conviction: that the release of the remaining hostages should come before everything.In Tel Aviv, where noisy anti-war demonstrations have been held for well over a year, images of the hostages are held aloft, while other protestors sit on the road, cradling pictures of Palestinian children killed during the war.Amid the row generated by the letters, such emotive displays appear to have rattled the authorities.On 20 April, the police briefly told protesters that \"pictures of children or babies from Gaza\" would not be permitted, along with posters displaying the words \"genocide\" or \"ethnic cleansing\".Following expressions of outrage from the organisers, the police quickly backed down.Meanwhile, the prime minister continues to speak of his determination to defeat Hamas.Military pressure, Netanyahu continues to insist, is the only way to bring the hostages home.', 'location': 'ISR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Israeli Reservists Pressure Netanyahu to End Gaza War\\nENTITIES: Netanyahu, Hamas, Israeli reservists, Danny Yatom\\nEVENT: Thousands of Israeli reservists are demanding an end to the Gaza war, criticizing Netanyahu's focus and prioritizing hostage release.\\nCONTEXT: Growing dissent within Israel questions Netanyahu's war strategy and hostage prioritization.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-02T16:09:34.237Z'}, {'id': 39701, 'sourceId': 882, 'url': 'https://news.sky.com/story/iphones-sold-in-us-will-no-longer-come-from-china-as-apple-reveals-impact-of-trumps-tariffs-13359607', 'title': \"iPhones sold in US will no longer come from China -

But the 15-year-old California sea lion\\'s talent shines most in bobbing to disco hits like “Boogie Wonderland.”Article continues below this ad“She just nails that one,” swaying her head in time to the tempo changes, said Peter Cook, a behavioral neuroscientist at New College of Florida who has spent a decade studying Ronan’s rhythmic abilities.Not many animals show a clear ability to identify and move to a beat aside from humans, parrots and some primates. But then there’s Ronan, a bright-eyed sea lion that has scientists rethinking the meaning of music.A former rescue sea lion, she burst to fame around a decade ago after scientists reported her musical skills. From age 3, she has been a resident at the University of California, Santa Cruz’s Long Marine Laboratory, where researchers including Cook have tested and honed her ability to recognize rhythms.Ronan joined a select group of animal movers and shakers -- which also includes Snowball the famed dancing cockatoo -- that together upended the long-held idea that the ability to respond to music and recognize a beat was distinctly human.Article continues below this adWhat is particularly notable about Ronan is that she can learn to dance to a beat without learning to sing or talk musically.“Scientists once believed that only animals who were vocal learners — like humans and parrots — could learn to find a beat,” said Hugo Merchant, a researcher at Mexico’s Institute of Neurobiology, who was not involved in the Ronan research.But in the years since since Ronan came into the spotlight, questions emerged about whether she still had it. Was her past dancing a fluke? Was Ronan better than people at keeping a beat?To answer the challenge, Cook and colleagues devised a new study, published Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports.Article continues below this adThe result: Ronan still has it. She’s back and she’s better than ever.This time the researchers focused not on studio music but on percussion beats in a laboratory. They filmed Ronan bobbing her head as the drummer played three different tempos — 112, 120, and 128 beats per minute. Two of those beats Ronan had never been exposed to, allowing scientists to test her flexibility in recognizing new rhythms.And the researchers asked 10 college students to do the same, waving their forearm to changing beats.Ronan was the top diva.Article continues below this ad“No human was better than Ronan at all the different ways we test quality of beat-keeping,” said Cook, adding that \"she\\'s much better than when she was a kid,” indicating lifetime learning.The new study confirms Ronan\\'s place as one of the “top ambassadors” of animal musicality, said University of Amsterdam music cognition researcher Henkjan Honing, who was not involved in the study.Researchers plan to train and test other sea lions. Cook suspects other sea lions can also bob to a beat — but that Ronan will still stand out as a star performer.Article continues below this ad___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

If you know your comics history, you know they are actually the first-ever Marvel heroes (after the published adopted the name in 1961). And to be honest, their appearance is hardly a surprise if you\\'ve caught wind of Marvel\\'s cinematic slate for 2025. Still, it\\'s hard to resist the excitement in the air for what\\'s to come very, very soon. The big post-credits scene that caps off Thunderbolts* is very obvious set-up for what is bound to one of the summer\\'s biggest movies. But if you\\'re still scratching your ahead over what the Thunderbolts* post-credits scene means, don\\'t worry. We obsessives at Esquire are here to help you make sense of that, ahem, fantastic cliff-hanger. Are you ready? It\\'s clobberin\\' time.Warning: Major spoilers for Thunderbolts* ahead.Marvel StudiosThunderbolts* is a bright spot amidst a rough stretch for the MCU. What Happens in the Post-credits Scene of Thunderbolts*?Over a year after Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) has unveiled the Thunderbolts, a.k.a. \"The New Avengers\" to the world, the heroes (presumably fresh from another mission) regroup at their new home: the refurbished Avengers Tower. After some bickering and bantering—and the revelation that Bob (Lewis Pullman) can\\'t fully control his powers as The Sentry, and is rendered on the sidelines as a benchwarmer—their HQ\\'s A.I. computer systems alert them to an anomaly in space.When Yelena (Florence Pugh) and Bucky (Sebastian Stan) order their computer to enhance the image, they find a spaceship torpedoing into Earth\\'s atmosphere. After a few more seconds of suspense, the ship turns to reveal a stylized blue \"4\" on the side of the ship. Yes, it\\'s exactly what you think it means: The Fantastic Four are entering the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Granted, you knew that already, what with the cast announced, a trailer already online, and a release date set for July 25. And eagle-eyed viewers who actually read the end credits saw it coming; Michael Giacchino\\'s theme for The Fantastic Four: The First Steps is included in the music credits of Thunderbolts* (next to Starship\\'s \"Nothing\\'s Gonna Stop Us Now\"), which kind of spoils the surprise. But imagine telling Marvel fans ten years ago the Fantastic Four are in the MCU. It would blow their minds to smithereens! Whatever you want to say about the Marvel franchise in its current state, it\\'s impossible to overstate how cool it is that the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, and the Avengers (and Black Panther, and Shang-Chi, and Ant-Man, and Namor, and...) will collide in one movie. So it just makes sense that Marvel is seizing on the chance to turn Thunderbolts* into a marketing opportunity for The Fantastic Four: The First Steps.

The United States should respond to the reasonable concern of the international community, and give a responsible answer to the world.'\\xa0The report goes on to say:\\xa0'Substantial evidence suggested the COVID-19 might have emerged in the United States earlier than its officially-claimed timeline, and earlier than the outbreak in China.'Despite originally being dismissed as a racist conspiracy theory, The CIA and FBI both believe evidence points to the Wuhan lab\\xa0as the source of the virus. China has been fending off allegations of a lab leak for years, often becoming the target of China hawks in Congress who have advanced investigative reports into the pandemic¿s origins Many virologists and epidemiologists still believe that the coronavirus emerged in the human population after being transmitted between various animal hosts.The Chinese government said in its latest report that the US should not continue to 'pretend to be deaf and dumb,' but should respond to the legitimate concerns of the international community.The report comes after White House launched a new Covid website earlier this month, where the official line is that the coronavirus escaped from the WIV labs while criticizing former President Joe Biden and top infectious disease specialist Dr Anthony Fauci.The Chinese government wrote in its white paper that in January 2020, 'the US was aware that an epidemic of a novel coronavirus was spreading quickly within its borders' and chose to 'downplay the severity of the epidemic… [on] multiple occasions compared Covid-19 to the flu, saying that it would disappear automatically one day.'The US has made China the primary scapegoat for its own mismanaged Covid-19 response. The US government's indifference and delayed actions wasted the precious time China had secured for the global fight against the pandemic.'The white paper goes on to allege that the virus has its roots in US soil, detailing respiratory disease outbreaks from May to October 2019 that the Chinese government alleges were Covid cases, though lab test results never concluded this.'A US CDC study revealed that out of 7,389 serological survey samples collected from nine states between December 13, 2019 and January 17, 2020, 106 were SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive. This suggests that the virus existed in the US before the first official case was identified,' the white paper said.It continued with a misleading claim that an NIH study proved that the coronavirus was widely circulating by December 2019.\\xa0NIH researchers tested 24,079 blood samples collected from participants across 50 states between January 2 and March 18, 2020, identifying nine containing antibodies for the virus. The White House launched a new Covid website earlier this month, where the official line is that the coronavirus escaped from the WIV labs while criticizing former President Joe Biden and top infectious disease specialist Dr Anthony Fauci. But antibody tests can cross-react with other coronaviruses, such as the common cold, and can produce false positives. Further, antibodies only confirm exposure, not active infection or chains of transmission.The Chinese government's framing also avoids noting that the initial sequences of the virus, conducted by officials at China's CDC, originated from patient samples at Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital and workers at the Huanan Seafood Market.It added that the US recorded around 1,500 'serious laboratory incidents involving coronaviruses and other highly dangerous pathogens linked to diseases such as SARS, MERS, Ebola, anthrax, smallpox, and avian influenza.'The allegation excludes the fact that all but 11 incidents were minor, such as broken vials. Fifteen people contracted laboratory-acquired infections, and there were three unintended infections of animals.The Chinese government maintains that the US failed to proactively share information about early illness outbreaks with the World Health Organization. 'The US should cease from shifting blame and evading responsibility, stop finding external excuses for its internal malaise, and genuinely reflect on and overhaul its public health policies,' the Chinese government said.'The US cannot continue to turn a deaf ear to the numerous questions over its conduct.'\", 'location': 'CHN', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: China blames US for Covid-19 pandemic\\nENTITIES: China, America, Trump campaign, Wuhan Institute of Virology, State Council Information Office, Joe Biden, Anthony Fauci, World Health Organization\\nEVENT: China claims the US is to blame for the Covid-19 pandemic, releasing a white paper suggesting the virus may have originated in the United States, rebutting claims it leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\\nCONTEXT: China's white paper alleges US origin of COVID-19.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-02T16:09:34.237Z'}, {'id': 39530, 'sourceId': 12389, 'url': 'https://www.menshealth.com/health/a64645405/chicken-cancer-study/', 'title': \"A Major Study Just Connected Chicken With Cancer.

If not, heads up: You will soon. These stories are based on new research published in the journal Nutrients that concluded that eating a typical amount of chicken on a weekly basis will cause your cancer risk to skyrocket. Oh, and it might raise the odds of dying prematurely, too. The findings go against pretty much everything we know about eating chicken, which is generally regarded as a high-quality protein source. With that, it’s fair to have questions. Here’s why an oncologist and dietitians aren’t scrambling to recommend that you abandon poultry based on this study.What did the study find?For this research, scientists from Italy’s National Institute of Gastroenterology analyzed dietary and health data from 4,869 Italian adults over the span of 19 years. The mean age of the participants was 65.4 years, and the oldest subject was 105 years old. The dietary data include information on the amount of poultry, red meat, and overall meat the participants ate. During the study period, 1,028 died. The mean age of people who died was 81.09, while it was slightly lower—79.94—for men. The researchers discovered that, of the people who died during the study period, 41 percent of their weekly meat intake was made up of rabbit and poultry (and within that category, poultry made up 29 percent). People who ate more than 300 grams of poultry (or 10.5 ounces) a week were more than twice as likely to die from a digestive cancer than those who ate less than 100 grams (3.5 ounces) of poultry weekly. People in this poultry-loving group were also 27 percent more likely to die during the study period than those who had less than 100 grams a week.The researchers concluded that eating more than 10.5 ounces of poultry a week is linked with a “statistically significant increased mortality risk both from all causes and from gastrointestinal cancers. The risk is higher for men than for women.”So, based on their conclusion, you might think that the chicken breast you just cooked up is trying to give you cancer or kill you. There are some big caveats hereIf that conclusion seems a bit intense, you’d be correct. We connected with an oncologist, dietitian, and nutrition researcher, and all pointed out some obvious flaws and caveats to this study.Let’s start at the beginning. “This is an observational study, it doesn’t prove causation,” says Wael Harb, M.D., oncologist at MemorialCare Cancer Institute at Orange Coast and Saddleback Medical Centers in Orange County, CA. Meaning, while the study found a link between eating chicken and cancer, it didn’t prove that a chicken habit will actually give you cancer (or kill you).The findings sound important, but without understanding things like the baseline health risks of the participants and other potential factors like their overall diet, lifestyle, or socioeconomic status (all of which could influence cancer risk), it’s hard to make big conclusions, says Sylvia Crowder, Ph.D., a dietary and nutrition researcher in the Department of Health Outcomes and Behavior at Moffitt Cancer Center. It's also possible that something else was happening behind the scenes, like people who ate more poultry had other habits that raised their risk of cancer, like a low fiber intake or a smoking habit, says Scott Keatley, R.D., co-owner of Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy.There’s even a chance that people who were in the early stages of gastrointestinal cancer ate more poultry because it’s light and easy to digest, Crowder says. “The higher poultry intake could be a result of these early symptoms and not the cause of cancer, which could skew the study results,” she explains. Finally, Crowder points out that this is just one study, and other research suggests that chicken is good for you in moderation. “Replication is key in science,” she says. There’s a theory on why chicken might be linked to cancer, though. It all comes down to the way the chicken is cooked. “When meat is cooked at high temperatures—think: grilling, pan-searing, or frying—it can create compounds that damage DNA and may increase cancer risk,” Keatley says. These are called heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. “They form when muscle meat is cooked in ways that cause browning or charring,” Keatley says. “The study did not look at cooking method, so it is possible the link they saw was really about how the chicken was cooked, not the chicken itself.” If the same people who eat a lot of poultry usually grill or fry it, it could explain the higher risk, Crowder says. Note: This doesn't mean you're destined to get cancer if you eat grilled or fried chicken, either—it's just that there's a stronger association here.Experts say you’re just fine to keep eating chicken.The U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests having poultry one to three times a week, and experts say this recommendation stands. “Don’t panic or overhaul your diet based on one observational study,” Crowder says. “Instead, this is a reminder of the importance of overall dietary patterns. Variety, moderation, and whole-food choices remain key.”Still, she adds that “no single food, especially one like poultry that’s generally considered lean protein, is likely to make or break your health in isolation.”If you want to play it extra safe, Keatley recommends paying attention to how you cook your chicken. “Cooking to a safe internal temperature is important, but excessive browning, blackening, or deep-fat frying can create harmful compounds,” he says. “Just as important, make sure the rest of your diet includes vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats. That full picture matters more than any one food.” Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

During the team’s last homestand, he got a text message from a high school friend. It was the first text he had received from him.Cubs center fielder Pete Crow-Armstrong had just used “Front to Back” — a song from Hauldren\\'s electronic music group, Levity — as his walkup music in a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers.“I was like ‘What? Like, no way,\\'\" Hauldren recalled. “I, like, had to do my research for myself.”Sure enough, it was true. Hauldren confirmed the authenticity of the moment through a tangential connection to the emerging star.Crow-Armstrong\\'s girlfriend has a cousin who is friends with the girlfriend of PJ Carberry, another member of Levity.“My girlfriend, her cousin and her sister actually all just went to go watch them in Arizona,” Crow-Armstrong said. “I had already been talking about making one of their songs my walkout, so I just decided to do it.”Crow-Armstrong, a 23-year-old Southern California native, also uses Larry June\\'s “Still Boomin” for his walkup song. He said he isn\\'t a big fan of dubstep — the subset of electronic dance music where Levity lands most of the time — but he likes Levity\\'s stuff.Music is a prominent part of Crow-Armstrong\\'s daily routine, and he enjoys the process of picking a walkup song.“Music’s the best thing ever. I mean, literally, universally, it is the best thing ever,” he said.Hauldren, 26, has a similar opinion when it comes to Crow-Armstrong’s baseball team. Hauldren is the youngest of four siblings in a White Sox family from suburban Chicago. He grew up going to White Sox games on the South Side.But he was always a Cubs fan.“It just kind of stuck, and a lot of my friends were Cubs fans, too,” he said. “So thankfully my dad would suck up his pride or whatever you would call it and take me to a Cubs game every once in a while.”The beginning of Levity goes back to Hauldren and Carberry connecting at the University of Iowa in 2017. They met Josh Tarum through mutual friends, and they started making music together.Hauldren and Carberry live in Chicago, and Hauldren worked on much of “Front to Back” at their place in Bucktown — not far from Wrigley Field.“My window is the skyline of Chicago and stuff,” Hauldren said. “And so seeing that song get played at Wrigley Field when it was made watching the skyline of Chicago and being very close to Wrigley Field was just insane to me.”After Crow-Armstrong used the song as his walkup music, Hauldren posted on Instagram about how much it meant to him. He tagged Crow-Armstrong in the post, and the two talked. They are hoping to meet up at some point.Levity played Coachella this year, and it is going to Lollapalooza this summer in Chicago\\'s Grant Park. But Hauldren said his connection with Crow-Armstrong ranks right up there when it comes to his most memorable experiences with his group.“I’m just very happy that if someone ever plays a walkout song for us, that it was the Cubs,” he said. “Like I couldn’t be happier that, you know, of all the teams that it was my team.”___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb', 'location': 'N/A', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Cubs fan\\'s song used as walkup music\\nENTITIES: John Hauldren, Pete Crow-Armstrong, Levity, Chicago Cubs\\nEVENT: Cubs outfielder Pete Crow-Armstrong used the song \"Front to Back\" by the electronic music group Levity, whose member John Hauldren is a lifelong Cubs fan, as his walkup music.\\nCONTEXT: Cubs fan\\'s song becomes player\\'s walkup music.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-02T16:09:34.237Z'}, {'id': 39792, 'sourceId': 888, 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/world/asia/vietnam-america-asia-retreat.html', 'title': '50 Years After the U.S. Left Vietnam, Another Retreat Is Shaking Asia', 'publishDate': '2025-05-01T05:25:47.000Z', 'content': 'AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTNews AnalysisEven among former enemies, the new American withdrawal from aid and democratic ideals is stirring deep feelings and confusion.Chinese soldiers taking part in a parade in Ho Chi Minh City on Wednesday to mark the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon and the end of the Vietnam War.Credit...Linh Pham for The New York TimesMay 1, 2025Fifty years ago, my father, an American war reporter, climbed over the wall of the U.S. Embassy in Saigon and scrambled onto a chopper that took off from a roof in the mission.“My last view of Saigon was through the tail door of the helicopter,” he wrote in the Chicago Daily News. “Then the door closed — closed on the most humiliating chapter in American history.”My father believed in the domino theory, how a cascade of Communism might deluge Asia.

Half a century after the pullout of the last American troops from Vietnam, it’s clear how Asia is learning to live, if not without the Americans, then with a new great power: China.Beijing’s imprint is everywhere, from the contested waters of the South China Sea, where delicate coral reefs have been churned up to build Chinese military bases, to remote villages in Nepal, where Chinese goods are flooding markets via Chinese-built roads.ImageA Chinese Coast Guard ship firing a water cannon at a Philippine Navy chartered vessel that was conducting a routine resupply mission last year to troops stationed at Second Thomas Shoal in the South China Sea.Credit...Ezra Acayan/Getty ImagesPresident Trump’s back-and-forth on tariffs, the blunting of American diplomacy and the dismantling of the agency for American aid — and with it hundreds of programs in Asia — feels like yet another withdrawal, and one that was not even compelled by military force.When an earthquake struck Myanmar in late March, killing more than 3,700 people, the United States was far slower than China in sending assistance. Then it fired American aid workers while they were on the ground there.“America used to stand for hope and democracy, but now they are missing when we needed them most,” said Ko Aung Naing San, a resident of Sagaing, the earthquake’s devastated epicenter. “China sent help quickly.”But in his next breath, Mr. Aung Naing San questioned Beijing’s intentions in Myanmar. He worried about China plundering Myanmar’s natural resources and pleaded for the United States to help. When a military junta overthrew the country’s elected leaders four years ago, a pro-democracy resistance begged for America to do something, anything, to repel the dictators.Washington will not intervene in Myanmar; another Southeast Asian quagmire is the last thing any U.S. administration wants. But American ideals and images, even when its bedrock institutions may be under threat at home, continue to resonate overseas: Hollywood, bluejeans, gauzy notions of freedom.In March, I interviewed Gen. Chhum Socheat, the deputy defense minister of Cambodia. The United States had helped refurbish parts of a military base there, but the Cambodian government later turned to China instead for a complete modernization. The American construction was razed, and in early April, the Chinese-built facility was unveiled with Chinese military officers in attendance.ImageTwo military ships berthed at a pier, center, at Cambodia’s Ream naval base off the country’s southern coast.

He pressed on.Cambodia, he said, was still recovering from the destruction of the Khmer Rouge years, during which radical Communists razed the society and oversaw the deaths of up to one-fifth of the country’s population.“We are developing our democracy, like America, but first we need peace and stability,” he said.I doubt that Cambodia, where a hereditary dictatorship has erased the political opposition and kneecapped free speech, is truly on a democratic trajectory. And one reason that Cambodians embraced the Khmer Rouge in 1975 was a brutal American bombing campaign that spilled over from the Vietnam War.Still, the deputy defense minister’s reference to American democracy meant something enduring about ideals. General Chhum Socheat said he wished America well, and he urged me to believe, against significant evidence otherwise, that Cambodia wanted to be with the Americans, too.About 25 years ago, shortly before the previous big anniversary of the Americans’ departure from what is now Ho Chi Minh City, I met with Pham Xuan An, a Vietnamese reporting colleague of my father’s. Uncle An, as he instructed me to call him, sat at a cafe where foreign correspondents, spies and the occasional novelist like Graham Greene used to sip thick coffees sweetened with condensed milk.ImagePham Xuan An, a Vietnam War correspondent for the U.S. news weekly Time who led a double life as a top North Vietnamese spy, in Ho Chi Minh City in 2005.

Uncle An wore a big watch on his thin wrist, a gift from my father, he said.“Mr. Beech was a patriot,” he said, pronouncing the word in the French way.Uncle An, too, was a patriot. He worked as a correspondent for Time magazine, but secretly held the rank of colonel in the North Vietnamese Army, sending intelligence to the Communists by invisible ink. He believed that Vietnam should strive for true independence, not be a pawn in an imperial game.Despite his years of loyal spying, Uncle An may have been tainted by his long association with Americans. His career in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam never quite reached the heights he had hoped. His son studied in the United States, just as he had once, then returned home.One day in the closing days of the Vietnam War, Uncle An told me, my father had wanted to go to a battlefield. A former U.S. Marine, my father was drawn to the trenches, filled with young men drafted into a war that was already curdling into a byword for American defeat. Uncle An told my father to go somewhere else.That day, the North Vietnamese attacked the place my father had not gone on Uncle An’s advice. My father lived while American soldiers died.“I like Americans,” Uncle An said.Hannah Beech is a Times reporter based in Bangkok who has been covering Asia for more than 25 years.

Armed with tractors, beach owners flatten every imperfection from the sand, dragging it to sift out anything large enough to be considered waste. As the sun rises, tourists flood the coastline, often unaware of what lies hidden beneath their feet.In Puglia, southern Italy, beach tourism is damaging turtle populations during hatching season. Photograph: Reda/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesTwo feet below the surface, delicate eggs laid by loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) are waiting to hatch. For the turtles, the beach is not a beauty spot but a habitat.As sand groomers have been transforming beaches from vital habitats into backdrops for photoshoots, their work has had an enormous impact on the turtle population. “Occupation of the beach by private owners reduces a vital living space for the turtle,” says Salvatore Urso, a naturalist and co-founder of Caretta Calabria Conservation, who has been monitoring and protecting loggerhead turtle nests since 2005. “There is still not much sensitivity to coexisting with this species.”Tractors not only crush or displace eggs – their mere presence can scare away female turtles, preventing them from nesting.As tourism surges in the region, the nests are protected by a handful of committed experts and volunteers. Piero Carlino is director of the Sea Turtle Recovery Centre in Calimera, where staff dedicate their summers to rescuing turtle eggs. They monitor the beaches on foot and with drones to spot nests, and when a nest is identified, volunteers place a fence around it to protect it during incubation. Later, they provide support during hatching, helping to guide the turtles towards the sea. “People look at our dedication and think we’re crazy,” says Carlino.The sand groomers versus the turtles is one of a series of conflicts between wildlife and tourists seeking picture-perfect locations that scientists and activists say are playing out around the Mediterranean as the holiday season looms.Tourists pack the beach in Scala di Furno, Porto Cesareo, Salento, Italy on 21 August 2023.

Visitors to the region account for about a third of all the world’s tourists, or about 330 million people in 2024 – and are forecast to reach 500m by 2030.As a criterion for holiday choice, “Instagrammability” is here to stay, according to a poll by travel booking agency eDreams, where 59% of French people aged between 25 and 34 said they chose their holiday destination because of it. The 2023 Experiences Traveler, a report based on a survey of 4,000 travellers across Europe and the US, concluded that Instagram was now the most influential platform for tourists planning activities and trips.On the Greek island of Naxos, in the Cyclades, local campaigner Eleni Andrianopulu expresses her worries over coffee. Tourist expectations, she argues, have been moulded to a new standard: the picture-perfect beach, villa and view – many of which are groomed and manicured at the expense of local ecosystems and people. “We, the people, and the place are just a decoration,” says Andrianopulu.Sun, sea and the perfect Instagram shot: the bay of Torre dell’Orso in Salento, Puglia. Photograph: Ragemax/AlamyIn some regions, the ecological concerns are mixed with broader anger about the social consequences of overtourism, and grassroots movements are springing up in opposition. On Naxos and its Cyclades neighbour Paros, Andrianopulu and Nicolas Stephanou formed part of the international “beach towel revolt” movement in 2023, protesting against the privatisation of beaches. Paros and Naxos are some of the driest islands in Greece and their unique culture comes from a “minimalist” way of life engendered by scarcity, Stephanou says.

This limits the freshwater available to the 185 million migratory birds for whom the Cyclades are a vital stopover. According to the WWF, in the Mediterranean basin the populations of wetland-dependent species have declined by 81% in the past 50 years.Across the Mediterranean, local and national governments are wrestling with the ecological and social effects of overtourism. Some, such as the Ciés islands off Galicia, have instituted caps on tourist numbers. Others have introduced fees, such as Venice, where tourists have to pay €5-€10 (£4.25-£8.50) to enter the city, or “visitor zones” and assigned time-slots to keep numbers in check. Elsewhere, authorities are experimenting with social media campaigns to reset tourist expectations of what they can photograph and experience.A placard reads ‘To reserve is to preserve’ on a path in Calanques national park, giving information on a reservation system to limit visitors.

The best view can be found from the clifftop. To immortalise it, some unscrupulous visitors go beyond the trails or park their car on the rocks, trampling endangered flora such as the endemic astragale plant.The park receives three million visitors a year, and the high footfall has damaged trails around the creeks: rocks have been polished by the soles of endless shoes, and the soil eroded to expose the roots of Mediterranean pines. In response, authorities have launched a “demarketing” campaign on Instagram. The national park authority’s Instagram page now features images of volunteer clean-ups and instructions on how to behave rather than enticing images of the park. “We want to display the fragility of the park,” says Zacharie Bruyas, communication director of the park.The influx of visitors to Calanques national park in south-east France is causing damage to its protected flora and fauna. Photograph: Andia/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesIn 2022, the authorities decided to limit access to some creeks to 400 visitors a day. The first results of the restrictions appear tentatively promising, according to Bruyas. “There are some plantlets that are growing,” he says, though adds “we remain cautious, nature needs time”. Hervé Menchon, the deputy coastline ecologist in Marseille, says the restrictions will continue for five more years, “so that we won’t be forced to make it a sanctuary”.Over time, the approach to social media in Calanques national park could become more common across the Mediterranean, with pictures of azure waters swapped for less glamorous shots of litter pickers. “This mission of protection is essential,” says Menchon. “The next generations won’t be tourists!”Some beach owners, such as Damiano Reale at Vivosa Apulia resort in Marina di Ugento, on the Ionian coast, are taking steps to protect sea turtle nests on their properties. Every morning, Reale and his team check if any eggs have been laid, and avoid using tractors and strong lights at night, which could disorient the turtles. If nests are found, they fence them off and monitor them 24/7 when it’s time for the hatchlings to emerge.“It is important to make tourists, politicians and researchers understand that a smart balance between commercial use of a beach and appreciation – whether of its history or its natural events – is absolutely possible,” says Reale.A loggerhead turtle nesting site is fenced off on Torvaianica beach, near Rome, Italy. Photograph: Guglielmo Mangiapane/ReutersPuglia’s director of the coastal state property and assets, Costanza Moreo, said in a statement that the region was “committed to protecting the nesting of Caretta caretta sea turtles”, had issued an ordinance that it was “forbidden to carry out activities that may endanger the nesting and hatching of eggs of protected species” and that beach cleaning should be done in a way that does not disturb nests.However, scientists say these orders are not well enforced, and are only applied to known nests - leaving it possible for hidden nests and breeding grounds to be damaged.In Greece, Andrianopulu says they have successfully campaigned for a ban on vehicles being used for beach grooming this year. “It is a big success that the machines that were there for years to flatten the beach will not be working this year … my only concern is that the progress we’re making is too slow in comparison to the massive and rapid destruction.” This piece is being published in conjunction with the online magazine MagmaFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield in the Guardian app for more nature coverage', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Tourism threatens Mediterranean wildlife, ecosystems, sparks protests\\nENTITIES: Puglia, Italy, Caretta caretta, Naxos, Paros, Calanques National Park\\nEVENT: Beach grooming and overtourism damage turtle habitats and ecosystems across the Mediterranean, prompting conservation efforts and protests.\\nCONTEXT: Instagram-driven tourism harms Mediterranean ecosystems, sparking local opposition.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-02T16:09:34.237Z'}, {'id': 40469, 'sourceId': 915, 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/may/02/soviet-era-spacecraft-kosmos-482-uncontrolled-return-earth-next-week', 'title': 'Soviet-era spacecraft expected to plunge uncontrolled to Earth next week', 'publishDate': '2025-05-01T23:14:38.000Z', 'content': 'A Soviet-era spacecraft meant to land on Venus in the 1970s is expected to soon plunge uncontrolled back to Earth.It’s too early to know where the half-ton mass of metal might come down or how much of it will survive re-entry, according to space debris-tracking experts.Dutch scientist Marco Langbroek predicts the failed spacecraft will re-enter about 10 May. He estimates it will come crashing in at 150mph (242km/h), if it remains intact.“While not without risk, we should not be too worried,” Langbroek said in an email.The object is relatively small and, even if it doesn’t break apart, “the risk is similar to that of a random meteorite fall, several of which happen each year. You run a bigger risk of getting hit by lightning in your lifetime,” he said.The chance of the spacecraft actually hitting someone or something is small, he added. “But it cannot be completely excluded.”The Soviet Union launched the spacecraft known as Kosmos 482 in 1972, one of a series of Venus missions. But it never made it out of Earth orbit because of a rocket malfunction.Most of it came tumbling down within a decade. But Langbroek and others believe the landing capsule itself — a spherical object about 3ft (1 metre) in diameter — has been circling the world in a highly elliptical orbit for the past 53 years, gradually dropping in altitude.It’s quite possible that the 1,000lb-plus (nearly 500kg) spacecraft will survive re-entry. It was built to withstand a descent through the carbon dioxide-thick atmosphere of Venus, said Langbroek of Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.Experts doubt the parachute system would work after so many years. The heat shield may also be compromised after so long in orbit.It would be better if the heat shield fails, which would cause the spacecraft to burn up during its dive through the atmosphere, Jonathan McDowell at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics said in an email. But if the heat shield holds, “it’ll re-enter intact and you have a half-ton metal object falling from the sky”.The spacecraft could re-enter anywhere between 51.7 degrees north and south latitude, or as far north as London and Edmonton in Alberta, Canada, almost all the way down to South America’s Cape Horn.

It\\'s also where the term conclave comes from — \"under lock and key,\" because the cardinals who were meeting in Viterbo, north of Rome, took so long the town\\'s frustrated citizens locked them in the room.The secret vote that elected Pope Gregory X lasted from November 1268 to September 1271. It was the first example of a papal election by “compromise,” after a long struggle between supporters of two main geopolitical medieval factions — those faithful to the papacy and those supporting the Holy Roman Empire.Gregory X was elected only after Viterbo residents tore the roof off the building where the prelates were staying and restricted their meals to bread and water to pressure them to come to a conclusion. Hoping to avoid a repeat, Gregory X decreed in 1274 that cardinals would only get “one meal a day” if the conclave stretched beyond three days, and only “bread, water and wine” if it went beyond eight. That restriction has been dropped.Before 1274, there were times when a pope was elected the same day as the death of his predecessor. After that, however, the church decided to wait at least 10 days before the first vote. Later that was extended to 15 days to give all cardinals time to get to Rome. The quickest conclave observing the 10-day wait rule appears to have been the 1503 election of Pope Julius II, who was elected in just a few hours, according to Vatican historian Ambrogio Piazzoni. In more recent times, Pope Francis was elected in 2013 on the fifth ballot, Benedict XVI won in 2005 on the fourth and Pope Pius XII won on the third in 1939.The first conclave held under Michelangelo\\'s frescoed ceiling in the Sistine Chapel was in 1492. Since 1878, the world-renowned chapel has become the venue of all conclaves. “Everything is conducive to an awareness of the presence of God, in whose sight each person will one day be judged,” St. John Paul II wrote in his 1996 document regulating the conclave, “Universi Dominici Gregis.” The cardinals sleep a short distance away in the nearby Domus Santa Marta hotel or a nearby residence.Most conclaves were held in Rome, with some taking place outside the Vatican walls. Four were held in the Pauline Chapel of the papal residence at the Quirinale Palace, while some 30 others were held in St. John Lateran Basilica, Santa Maria Sopra Minerva or other places in Rome. On 15 occasions they took place outside Rome and the Vatican altogether, including in Viterbo, Perugia, Arezzo and Venice in Italy, and Konstanz, Germany and Lyon, France.Between 1378-1417, referred by historians to as the Western Schism, there were rival claimants to the title of pope. The schism produced multiple papal contenders, the so-called anti-popes, splitting the Catholic Church for nearly 40 years. The most prominent anti-popes during the Western Schism were Clement VII, Benedict XIII, Alexander V, and John XXIII. The schism was ultimately resolved by the Council of Constance in 1417, which led to the election of Martin V, a universally accepted pontiff.The cloistered nature of the conclave posed another challenge for cardinals: staying healthy. Before the Domus Santa Marta guest-house was built in 1996, cardinal electors slept on cots in rooms connected to the Sistine Chapel. Conclaves in the 16th and 17th centuries were described as “disgusting” and “badly smelling,” with concern about disease outbreaks, particularly in summer, according to historian Miles Pattenden. “The cardinals simply had to have a more regular and comfortable way of living because they were old men, many of them with quite advanced disease,” Pattenden wrote. The enclosed space and lack of ventilation further aggravated these issues. Some of the electors left the conclave sick, often seriously.Initially, papal elections weren’t as secretive but concerns about political interference soared during the longest conclave in Viterbo. Gregory X decreed that cardinal electors should be locked in seclusion, “cum clave” (with a key), until a new pope was chosen. The purpose was to create a totally secluded environment where the cardinals could focus on their task, guided by God’s will, without any political interference or distractions. Over the centuries, various popes have modified and reinforced the rules surrounding the conclave, emphasizing the importance of secrecy. Pope John XII was just 18 when he was elected in 955. The oldest popes were Pope Celestine III (elected in 1191) and Celestine V (elected in 1294) who were both nearly 85. Benedict XVI was 78 when he was elected in 2005.There is no requirement that a pope be a cardinal, but that has been the case for centuries. The last time a pope was elected who wasn’t a cardinal was Urban VI in 1378. He was a monk and archbishop of Bari. While the Italians have had a stranglehold on the papacy over centuries, there have been many exceptions aside from John Paul II (Polish in 1978) and Benedict XVI (German in 2005) and Francis (Argentine in 2013). Alexander VI, elected in 1492, was Spanish; Gregory III, elected in 731, was Syrian; Adrian VI, elected in 1522, was from the Netherlands.', 'location': 'VAT', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Ten historical facts about papal conclaves\\nENTITIES: Pope, Catholic Church, Vatican City\\nEVENT: The article details ten historical facts about papal conclaves, including the longest conclave, anti-popes, and conclave conditions.\\nCONTEXT: The article provides historical context to the election of a new Pope.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-02T16:09:34.237Z'}, {'id': 41150, 'sourceId': 929, 'url': 'https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/tariff-turmoil-prompts-cloudy-forecasts-general-motors-harley-121365761', 'title': 'Tariff turmoil prompts cloudy forecasts from General Motors, Harley-Davidson for the year ahead', 'publishDate': '2025-05-01T16:46:52.000Z', 'content': 'Uncertainty continues to hang over the latest round of financial results and forecasts for companies both big and small as they try to navigate a global trade system severely shaken by a stark shift in U.S. policyByDAMIAN J. TROISE AP business writerMay 1, 2025, 12:40 PMNEW YORK -- Uncertainty continues to hang over the latest round of financial results and forecasts for companies both big and small as they try to navigate a global trade system severely shaken by a shift in U.S. policy.Roughly half of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported their latest quarterly financial results, but the focus has been on how they will adjust to tariffs and any change in consumers’ behavior. Here’s a look a what companies are saying about tariffs and the potential impact:General Motors trimmed one of its profit measures as the carmaker braces for the potential impact from auto tariffs.Auto companies like General Motors have operations spread out throughout North America, with auto parts and assembly steps often crossing multiple borders before a car is produced.The company said that it expects full-year adjusted earnings before interest and taxes in a range of $10 billion to $12.5 billion. That’s down from a previous range of $13.7 billion to $15.7 billion. The revised guidance includes a current tariff exposure of $4 billion to $5 billion.President Donald Trump signed executive orders Tuesday to relax some of his 25% tariffs on automobiles and auto parts. Harley-Davidson withdrew its financial forecast for the year because of uncertainty over tariffs and the economy.The iconic motorcycle maker said it is focusing on productivity measures, supply chain management and cost controls to help deal with the impact from tariffs. The company gets just under 70% of its revenue from within the U.S., according to FactSet. That leaves a large chunk of its revenue exposed to retaliatory tariffs from other nations.Hershey reaffirmed its financial forecasts for the year, which include assessments for tariff expenses as they currently stand.The chocolate maker estimates the current tariff expenses to range from about $15 million to $20 million in the second quarter. Hershey and other chocolate makers are already dealing with cocoa supply issues that have helped push prices higher. More than 70% of the global cocoa supply comes from West Africa and the region has been dealing with stressed and damaged crops for years.Church & Dwight slashed its financial forecasts for the year as it faces the impact from tariffs and a potential slowdown in consumer spending.The maker of Arm & Hammer and other household and personal care products now expects earnings to range from flat to 2% growth. It previously forecast earnings growth of up to 8%.It estimated that its tariff exposure over the next 12 months is about $190 million. The company hopes to reduce that exposure by up to 80% with several measures, including no longer sourcing Waterpik flossers from China for the U.S. market. It will also potentially shut down or sell some of its brands.___AP writer Michelle Chapman contributed to this report.', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Tariffs cloud forecasts for major companies\\nENTITIES: General Motors, Harley-Davidson, Hershey, Church & Dwight, Donald Trump, China, U.S.\\nEVENT: General Motors trimmed profit measures, Harley-Davidson withdrew its financial forecast, Hershey reaffirmed its forecast, and Church & Dwight slashed its forecast due to tariffs and potential consumer spending slowdown.\\nCONTEXT: Tariffs create uncertainty for companies forecasting financials.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-02T16:09:34.237Z'}, {'id': 45121, 'sourceId': 12750, 'url': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14670657/MAFS-pregnant-miscarriage.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490', 'title': 'Married At First Sight star breaks down as she announces pregnancy after suffering tragic...', 'publishDate': '2025-05-02T04:38:19.000Z', 'content': \"05:22, 02 May 2025, updated 05:38, 02 May 2025 By STEPHEN BISSET FOR DAILY MAIL AUSTRALIA READ MORE: MAFS star Lucinda Light slammed for supporting JoJo Siwa and Chris Hughes after Dance Moms star brutally dumped her Aussie girlfriendMarried At First Sight star Beck Zemek has broken down in tears after revealing she is pregnant with her second child.Beck shared, back in December, that she and fiancé Ben Mitchell had suffered a heartbreaking miscarriage.Taking to Instagram on Thursday, the 31-year-old Perth-based influencer shared a video, shot back in March, that showed her reading her positive pregnancy text.Beck could barely contain her emotion, breaking down in tears as she saw the positive result.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0'After a silent miscarriage and a D&C, finding out I'm pregnant again has brought a mix of emotions I didn't know I could feel all at once,' she captioned the clip.'

First-gamer Jayme Fressard scored twice down the left wing in what was a stunning debut Both sides will now take a fortnight off before they return to play at the Allianz Arena on May 15 After Sergis scored the opener down the right within four minutes, halfback Southwell had a hand in the Blues' next three tries.In her first Origin game since 2023, Southwell combined seamlessly with new captain Kelly and second-rower Yasmin Clydsdale, with the former crashing over before Fressard's double.Prop forward Johnston put the Blues on the path to victory when she burrowed over with 20 minutes to play and could have had a second.\\xa0She was narrowly held up in the final 10 minutes.Fellow debutant Church confirmed the victory later in that set as Southwell threw the last pass to help make it a four-score game.Five-eighth Tarryn Aiken was Queensland's best, sending up the bomb that helped Lofipo score the Maroons' first before putting debutant Rory Owen over with a flat ball.But the Maroons could be thankful the deficit was not larger with Southwell missing three conversion attempts.One of eight Origin debutants across the two sides, Queensland's Jasmine Peters suffered a game-ending head knock colliding with Sarah Togatuki just before the break.But she is set to clear concussion protocols by the second game of the series in Sydney on May 15.Kelly, meanwhile, was full of praise for her young side tonight.

Allies and enemies alike are beginning to adapt.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesMay 1, 2025It was well after 2 a.m., but an aide to Vice President JD Vance was trying to roust a senior Ukrainian official out of his bed in a Munich hotel. He wanted a face-to-face meeting to close a deal letting the United States extract valuable minerals in Ukraine, a priority of the new president, Donald J. Trump.It had to be done that night, the aide said, before Mr. Vance was scheduled to meet the next day with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine at a trans-Atlantic security conference. The Ukrainian protested that it was late and refused to leave his room, according to a foreign policy adviser briefed on the incident. The meeting the next day went ahead, though the proposal remained unsigned.The minerals deal, which was finally signed on Wednesday, and the pre-dawn attempt to push it through in February, are a telling symbol of American statecraft in the second Trump administration. Exploitative, transactional, almost imperial in its demands, the deal encapsulates Mr. Trump’s approach to the world in his first 100 days, a chaotic period unlike any in the post-World War II era.From the NATO alliance to the global trading system, Mr. Trump has swung a giant wrecking ball through the existing world order.ImageNew cars at an import and export zone in Guangzhou, China, last month. China has responded to Mr. Trump’s triple-digit levies in kind — confident that in many industries, it so completely dominates the supply chain that rivals would find it hard to make comparable goods elsewhere.Credit...Qilai Shen for The New York TimesImageU.S. marines participating in a NATO Arctic training exercise in northern Norway in March. European officials worry that tens of thousands of American troops may be pulled out of Europe over the next few months or years.Credit...Davide Monteleone for The New York TimesHe has seemed, at times, heedless of the cost to the domestic and global economy, to trust in the United States or to the value of its most credit-worthy holdings. The dollar swooned and the yield on Treasury bonds spiked as investors fled American assets.Mr. Trump has bluntly challenged the core principle of national sovereignty, hectoring Canada to become the 51st American state and threatening Greenland with an American military occupation. His across-the-board tariffs have halted a decades-long march toward free trade and open markets, driving up prices, paralyzing investors, chilling consumers and triggering a dangerous trade war with China.“We will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of any longer,” the president declared in his inaugural address in January. “During every day of the Trump administration, I will, very simply, put America first.”In his headlong rush to replace Pax Americana with America First, Mr. Trump has left the world fumbling to adjust to a new landscape, the contours of which are still in flux. To many foreign leaders, who grew up in a world cushioned by the postwar alliances and multilateral institutions created by the United States, the president’s approach has landed with the unsettling thud of a predawn visit at the door.“For America’s friends and allies, this is traumatic,” said Malcolm Turnbull, who was prime minister of Australia during Mr. Trump’s first term. “It’s like discovering your spouse has betrayed you and has a secret life. Suddenly you discover that the U.S. has a thoroughly different agenda.”Mr. Turnbull had his own run-in with Mr. Trump in 2017 over the handling of refugees. But this time, he said, is different. Untrammeled by advisers who curbed his most extreme impulses in the first term, Mr. Trump has moved with dizzying speed across multiple fronts. He is trading allies for adversaries in Europe, floating a far-fetched proposal to rebuild war-torn Gaza, and sending immigrants — in at least one case, accidentally — to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, beyond the reach of American courts.ImageRelatives of Arturo Suárez protesting his deportation to El Salvador in Caracas, Venezuela in March.

Recognizing that Mr. Trump’s policies may no longer be simply the passing fancies of an aberrational leader, countries are making new commitments and seeking new alliances — in some cases, new leaders — the better to cope with an erratic, unreliable and inward-looking America.A few are standing their ground, whether it is the patriotic resistance of Canadians and Greenlanders or China’s tit-for-tat response to Mr. Trump’s tariffs. Even Mr. Zelensky’s foot-dragging on the minerals deal resulted in an agreement that provides Ukraine with a degree of American engagement in return for America’s access to proceeds from Ukraine’s reserves of rare earth minerals.The late-night request by Mr. Vance’s aide for a face-to-face meeting in Munich, officials familiar with the episode said, was part of a lengthy exchange of texts and calls over the deal between him and Ukrainian officials.There are signs that firmness has an effect: In Canada, Prime Minister Mark Carney won an election victory this week with a stand-up-to-Trump message. Mr. Trump has adjusted his tariffs against China to exempt key products, while he and Mr. Zelensky held, by all accounts, a good meeting before Pope Francis’ funeral at the Vatican, two months after their spectacular bust-up in the Oval Office.“We don’t know whether the shock-and-awe approach is going to be a permanent fixture of American foreign policy or a more fleeting phenomenon,” said Wolfgang Ischinger, who served as Germany’s ambassador to the United States from 2001 to 2006. “So, we’re trying to hedge against the consequences of what has already happened and hedge against possible future developments.”In Germany, that has opened the door to a landmark spending package of 500 billion euros ($568 billion) on defense and public-works projects. It was prodded, Mr. Ischinger said, by the “electric shock of Donald Trump” and his abrupt pivot from Europe to Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin.It has been a harrowing 100 days, forcing America’s partners through a process not unlike the stages of grief popularized by the psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross. Denial, anger, bargaining, depression and ultimately, a measure of acceptance — all these emotions, and more, are rippling through a world remade by Mr. Trump.Day 25, Munich: From Allies to AdversariesFew have embraced the role of the president’s enforcer abroad more enthusiastically than his vice president. Arriving on Valentine’s Day at the Munich Security Conference, Mr. Vance was armed with a quiver of arrows.Yet while waiting to give his speech in a kitchen next to the stage at the Hotel Bayerische Hof, he bantered easily with a handful of organizers and other officials, recalling his previous appearance at the meeting, as a senator in 2024, which he said had raised his stature and might even have helped him get picked by Mr. Trump as his running mate.“We all laughed and joked, and then he was like, ‘I might scare you a little,’” said one of the hosts, recalling the lighthearted exchange amid a clatter of pots and pans.Mr. Vance’s 18-minute speech did more than that. It all but shredded eight decades of trans-Atlantic ties. His big fear for Europe, he said, was not Russia or China, but the “threat from within — the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America.”Europe, he claimed, is a place where elite bureaucrats muzzle freedom of speech, cancel elections they don’t want and sideline parties they don’t agree with. European leaders were afraid of their own voters, he told the stunned audience, before delivering a thinly veiled endorsement of Germany’s far-right party, Alternative for Germany, or AfD, a week before a parliamentary election there.ImageVice President JD Vance at the Munich Security Conference in February.

The Cold War paradigm, in which the United States throws a security umbrella over its allies in Europe and Asia, is giving way to a much narrower view of American security, said Stephen K. Bannon, former chief strategist for Mr. Trump. It is built on securing America’s own hemisphere, while leaving the security of Europe and Asia to the Europeans and Asians.Mr. Bannon acknowledged the risks to this retrenchment, most obviously in East Asia, where China, having witnessed Mr. Trump’s tolerance of a revanchist Russia, might be emboldened to move on Taiwan, which it has long claimed as its own. He argued that Mr. Trump’s tariffs, which he described as “economic war,” would be a check on the territorial ambitions of China’s president, Xi Jinping.“What Trump is doing is rethinking the geostrategic order,” Mr. Bannon said. “It’s almost like the Congress of Vienna,” he said, referring to the early 19th-century diplomatic meetings that set the borders of a post-Napoleonic Europe.This, he said, also explains Mr. Trump’s designs on the Panama Canal, Canada and Greenland. No longer merely neighbors, they are ramparts in a hemispheric fortress. For some in Greenland, a remote Arctic expanse that Mr. Trump first suggested buying from Denmark in 2019, the interest was initially flattering.“I thought, ‘What a fascinating time to be living in Greenland,’” said Jorgen Qimussersuaq Kristensen, one of its most celebrated dog-sledding champions. “Suddenly, the world opened up to us.”But as Mr. Trump’s overtures grew more insistent — in January, he refused to rule out using military force to take the island — Greenlanders bridled. A planned visit in March by Mr. Vance’s wife, Usha, did not help. Originally, she was to attend the “Great Race of the North,” a dog-sled competition won by Mr. Kristensen five times.ImageThe locks at the Panama Canal’s Miraflores Visitor Center.

The vice president chided Denmark for its shabby treatment of Greenlanders, saying that only the United States would protect them.“That way of speaking — saying ‘We take Greenland’ — it’s not good,” Mr. Kristensen said. “More Greenlanders don’t like them now.”Day 39, the Oval Office: Learning to Live With TrumpWhen Mr. Zelensky sat down with Mr. Trump in the Vatican last Saturday, their utilitarian cushioned metal chairs were a jarring contrast to the Renaissance splendor of St. Peter’s Basilica. The two men seemed to take little notice, leaning into each other, as if sharing a confidence. The White House described the brief meeting as “very productive.” Mr. Zelensky said it might prove historic.Whether a 15-minute huddle will salvage America’s support for Ukraine is, of course, too soon to say. But it may provide a lesson to leaders in how to deal with Mr. Trump. Since their bitter encounter on Feb. 28, when the president told Mr. Zelensky, “you don’t have the cards” against Russia, Mr. Trump has been nudged to the point where he now accuses Mr. Putin of stringing him along in cease-fire negotiations.The fence-mending began immediately after a grim-faced Mr. Zelensky left the White House that February evening. The next day, Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain soothed his bruised feelings over dinner at 10 Downing Street. He and President Emmanuel Macron of France then coached him on how to make amends. Both had paid calls on Mr. Trump that had gone well, not least because they were more solicitous.ImageMr. Trump berating Mr. Zelensky at a notorious meeting in the Oval Office of the White House in February.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesImageMr. Zelensky met with Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain and President Emmanuel Macron of France in London two days later, where the two leaders expressed their support for the Ukrainian president.Credit...Pool photo by WpaMr. Starmer dispatched his national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, to work with Mr. Zelensky on a response that would satisfy Mr. Trump. Mr. Zelensky initially recoiled at using the word “cease-fire,” worried that it would trap Ukraine in a truce that the Russians would breach. Mr. Powell crafted language that referred to ending the fighting “in a lasting way.”Mr. Starmer phoned Mr. Trump to see if he could live with that, according to officials briefed on the deliberations. He said he could. Mr. Zelensky expressed regret over the Oval Office meeting, though he never formally apologized.In some cases, foreign leaders have found, simply waiting out Mr. Trump is the best option. In early February, the president floated a pie-in-the-sky plan to relocate more than two million Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring Jordan and Egypt. The ruined enclave, Mr. Trump said, could then be taken over by the United States and transformed into the “Riviera of the Middle East.”For Jordan’s King Abdullah II, who already hosts 2.4 million Palestinian refugees in his country, it was deeply aggravating, according to an Arab diplomat who was briefed on his reaction. Jordanian officials believe the idea originated with right-wing Israeli officials, some of whom have spoken openly of clearing Gaza of its Palestinian residents.Rather than become angry, Abdullah kept his cool, the diplomat said. At a meeting in the Oval Office a week later, Mr. Trump asked the king why he could not take more refugees. Abdullah replied that Jordan already had far more refugees, per capita, than the United States. It was a well-worn Jordanian talking point, but it nevertheless appeared to placate Mr. Trump. He has said little about the plan since then.Day 79, Guangzhou: China Doesn’t BlinkIf there is a unified theory behind Mr. Trump’s global disruption, it is the superpower rivalry with China, which he accuses of “ripping off” the United States through an unbalanced trade relationship. Yet the tariffs, an article of faith for Mr. Trump going back to the 1980s, have done little to intimidate the Chinese.When the noon hour struck on April 9 in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, and tariffs on Chinese exports soared in the United States, Elon Li barely took notice. Standing near the front of his busy factory, which turns out ovens and cooking equipment for restaurants, Mr. Li kept talking, even as his workers halted their screeching machines for lunch. He said his priority was on getting safety certifications so that he could start shipping through Amazon to the United States later this spring.The tariffs do not faze him. China’s manufacturing costs are so much lower than anywhere else in the world, Mr. Li said, that it would always be competitive. “I think it is OK, because there are not many choices,” he said.That pragmatic optimism has persisted in China in the face of Mr. Trump’s tariffs, and it has fueled perhaps the most forceful pushback by any country. China has responded to Mr. Trump’s triple-digit levies in kind — confident that in many industries, it so completely dominates the supply chain that rivals would find it hard to make comparable goods anywhere else.ImageA restaurant appliance and cookware factory in Guangzhou, China, last month.Credit...Qilai Shen for The New York TimesImageMr. Trump announcing reciprocal tariffs in the Rose Garden of the White House last month.Credit...Haiyun Jiang for The New York TimesChina’s real weapon may lie in the red-clay hills where it mines heavy rare-earth elements. In early April, it temporarily halted exports of rare-earth metals, which are turned into magnets, a crucial component in electric motors. China is creating a new export license system that could hinder the ability of American military contractors to obtain these supplies over the long term.China’s refusal to blink appears to be working. Mr. Trump recently handed out exemptions for consumer electronics, like laptop computers and smartphones. His Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said a trade war with China was not sustainable.Japan and South Korea, with smaller economies than China, are relying less on muscle than on their ties to the United States, which is, after all, still nominally an ally.Japan’s prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, sent an old friend who had studied in the United States, Ryosei Akazawa, to meet with Mr. Trump’s aides. He wound up getting a meeting with the president, who complained that “there are no American cars on your roads,” but gifted him a red MAGA baseball cap. South Korea’s acting president, Han Duck-soo, made clear in a CNN interview just before he spoke to Mr. Trump by phone, that his country would not join with China, as had been rumored, to counter the tariffs.Whether those gestures will work is anybody’s guess. Both countries are eager to strike trade deals, but the line of hopefuls in Washington is long. And Mr. Trump made his negotiating strategy clear in an Easter post on his Truth Social platform that could serve as a summary of the Trump doctrine.“The golden rule of negotiating and success,” Mr. Trump wrote. “He who has the gold makes the rules.”ImageThe White House at sunset on April 23.Credit...Haiyun Jiang for The New York TimesReporting was contributed by Katrin Bennhold and Steven Erlanger in Munich, Jeffrey Gettleman in Nuuk, Greenland, Aaron Boxerman in Jerusalem, Fatima AbdulKarim in Ramallah, West Bank, Keith Bradsher in Guangzhou, China, Martin Fackler in Tokyo, and Choe Sang-Hun in Seoul.Mark Landler is the London bureau chief of The Times, covering the United Kingdom, as well as American foreign policy in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.

The Connell family, which has been in the oyster business for 95 years, is still in the running.Last year, their oyster Big Boppa was presented by Bernie’s wife, Sharryn, and placed second at 2.44kg. Keithy – raised by Bernie’s son Steven – came third at 2.4kg.This year’s entrants will be weighed on Saturday, and it is customary for a vet to be present at the weigh-in, to ensure all competitors show signs of life.“It makes for good theatre on the main stage,” says Cath Peachey, chair of Narooma Rocks, which runs the festival.Sharryn Connell with Big Boppa.

While “probably not as big as Jill”, he’s moved her and others closer to the river mouth in hopes of better salinity.“They’re like lovely little siblings,” he says of his largest oysters. “You just do your best to keep them alive.”His wife, Valerie, says “we transport them like any other oyster – in a deep basket of water”.Valerie says community traditions are important to the family – her daughter even paints and decorates their shells.After hearing stories of oysters dying before the competition, she says: “We just hope none of ours will.”Kirk Hargreaves winning the 2022 competition with his champion shellfish, Uncle Ray, weighing 2.2kg.

The giant oyster has gone missing, according to Peachey.Bernie Connell holding Jill, who weighed 3.01kg, and his trophy from 2024.

Farmers move them around for health and safekeeping.”“Little Jim III still hasn’t been found yet,” she adds. “But I hope he’ll make an appearance.”Although Jill has passed away, she’ll still make an appearance at the festival. Connell plans to honour Jill’s legacy by wheeling her empty shell through the crowd in a pram – as he once did for another beloved oyster named Jack.“It’s not often you can get a world champion,” he says. “Every day at home you’d go have a look, see if anyone’s pinched her – it puts a bit of spark in you.”', 'location': 'AUS', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Australia seeks heaviest oyster after champion dies\\nENTITIES: Australia, Narooma oyster festival, Jill, Bernie Connell, Sharryn Connell, Steven Connell, Kate Le Bars, Shanna Provost, Cath Peachey, Jim Yiannaros, John Yiannaros, Poppy, Valerie, Kirk Hargreaves, Jade Norris, Avia, Riley, Jim Wild\\nEVENT: Australia's Biggest Oyster competition returns to Narooma oyster festival to find the country's heaviest living oyster.

The statement reiterated China\\'s stance that is open to talks, but also that Beijing is determined to fight if it must. “The tariff and trade wars were unilaterally initiated by the U.S., if the U.S. side wants to talk, it should show its sincerity, and be ready to take action on issues such as correcting wrong practices and canceling the unilateral imposition of tariffs,” it said. The statement cited an unnamed ministry spokesperson as saying that Beijing had taken note of various statements by senior U.S. officials indicating a willingness to negotiate over tariffs. \"At the same time, the U.S. has recently taken the initiative to convey information to the Chinese side on a number of occasions through relevant parties, hoping to talk with the Chinese side.

Richard Gerald Jordan, 78, who was sentenced to death in 1976 for kidnapping and killing a woman, has filed multiple death sentence appeals, the most recent of which was denied in October. The Mississippi ruling comes on the same day Army Combat veteran Jeffrey Hutchinson was scheduled to be executed in Florida. Before Thursday, 14 people had been executed in the U.S., including three in Florida. The order did not specify the manner in which Jordan will be executed. Mississippi law allows death sentences to be carried out using lethal injection, nitrogen gas, electrocution or firing squad.According to Mississippi Supreme Court records, Jordan kidnapped Edwina Marter in January 1976 and shot her to death in a forest in Harrison County. He then called her husband, Charles Marter, falsely claimed she was safe and asked for $25,000. Records show that before the killing Jordan had traveled from Louisiana to Gulfport, Mississippi and called the Gulf National Bank, where Charles Marter worked as a loan officer. After he was told Marter could speak with him, he hung up, looked up the Marters' home address and went to the house posing as an electric company employee. “After due consideration, the Court finds Jordan has exhausted all state and federal remedies for purposes of setting an execution,” the ruling read.Mississippi's last execution was in December 2022.\", 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Execution date set for longest-serving death row\\nENTITIES: Richard Gerald Jordan, Edwina Marter, Charles Marter, Mississippi Supreme Court, Gulf National Bank\\nEVENT: Richard Gerald Jordan, Mississippi's longest-serving death row inmate, is scheduled to be executed on June 25 for the 1976 kidnapping and murder of Edwina Marter.

The directors “got serious” after Tesla’s stock plunged and investors got “irritated” by Musk’s focus on his job as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm issued a statement in which she called the report “absolutely false.”“The CEO of Tesla is Elon Musk and the board is highly confident in his ability to continue executing on the exciting growth plan ahead,” Denholm stressed.\\nMusk reacted to the report on his X platform on Thursday, insisting that “it is an extremely bad breach of ethics that the Wall Street Journal would publish a deliberately false article” and slammed the outlet for its failure to include the Tesla board’s “unequivocal denial” of claims that it is searching for a new CEO in its article.In a separate comment, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO labeled the WSJ a “discredit to journalism.”Tesla suffered a 71% drop in profits and a 9% decline in revenue for the first quarter of 2025, during which time Musk became an increasingly polarizing figure, due to his close ties to US President Donald Trump and his work as the head of the DOGE, an agency tasked with slashing government spending.Since January, dozens of Tesla-linked locations have been hit by protests, in what Musk claims is a coordinated effort bankrolled by major Democratic donors. There have also been violent attacks, including arson attempts, on the company’s dealerships, vehicles and charging stations.A week ago, Musk announced that he will scale back his government role because the “major work” to establish DOGE has now been completed.

Am I being managed out of my job?BusinessWorkplaceWork therapyOpinionMay 2, 2025 — 5.01amMay 2, 2025 — 5.01amI have found recently that my manager, who has few people skills, is engaged in a subtle form of bullying: there is constant, daily criticism or micromanagement of everything I do. For example, I am called out in public for doing ‘the wrong thing’. Other colleagues follow the same process, but are not criticised.It’s at the point where whatever I do or say seems wrong, so my productivity is low due to second-guessing everything. It seems like I’m not wanted, but making my role redundant would be costly for the organisation.I am trying to determine whether I’m being “managed out” and if I am, is there anything I can do about it? If I were to resign, finding another job is easier said than done, so that is the last resort.You may have grounds for a formal bullying complaint, but it might be worth covering your bases before pursuing that.Credit: John ShakespeareBeing forced to constantly second-guess yourself at work is bad enough, but second-guessing yourself and then being criticised publicly for every decision is a kind of professional hell. I’m sorry to hear you’ve found yourself in this situation and can understand why you urgently want to find a resolution.I asked Associate Professor Anne Junor about your question. She is an honorary adjunct in the Industrial Relations Research Group at the School of Business, University of New South Wales Canberra.Junor told me that the first thing you should do is make sure your perceptions of the manager’s behaviour are accurate.It sounds like the relationship you have with your manager is badly strained – to say the least.“As you are being criticised in public, there may be a colleague who can confirm your impressions. What is their perception?” she says.“In any case, you need to do some background research, so that you’re clear about your rights, about the terms of your employment, and about whether the behaviour of your manager conforms with the definition of [workplace] bullying.”You can check that in a number of ways, but, according to Junor, a lot of what you may need is on the Fair Work Ombudsman website. It’s written in non-technical language and covers much of what you’ve mentioned in your question.Junor says a union can also provide this kind of advice, and you may want to contact one anyway to discuss your concerns and the way you’re being treated. Before you do that, however, it might be worth documenting specific moments in which your boss embarrasses you publicly.“Start keeping notes of incidents, and mark down dates and times. Then cross-check what you’ve noted down against a definition of bullying you’ve sought previously,” she says.It sounds like the relationship you have with your manager is badly strained – to say the least. If you think it’s salvageable – or that they may at least be willing to speak with you privately and civilly – Junor says you may want to consider requesting a meeting.“First, work out what you want from the meeting. That may be clarification of the manager’s attitude and intent. It may be a request for mediation – for example, asking for privacy on performance feedback or modification of the manager’s behaviour. Or it may be some other proposal for a resolution of this problem.“Then formulate specific questions or requests. And finally, organise a friend or union member to attend the meeting with you as a support person and note-taker.”LoadingIf the meeting fails, Junor says you might, at that point, want to move on to a formal bullying complaint.You mentioned that resignation is a last resort, which I completely understand. One thing you may want to consider is the phenomenon known as constructive dismissal.This is a legal term and it relates to being forced to resign due to the behaviour or negligence of your employee; you haven’t been explicitly sacked but have found yourself with no other choice but to quit your job.As always, I don’t want to give specific legal advice in this column, and constructive dismissal can be difficult to prove, but if you feel your treatment has become thoroughly intolerable, it may be something to keep in mind.Send your questions through to Work Therapy by emailing jonathan@theinkbureau.com.auGet workplace news, advice and perspectives to help make your job work for you.

People living in the 20% most deprived areas of England were twice as likely to be admitted to hospital for respiratory diseases, seven times as likely for tuberculosis and six times for measles, than their counterparts from the least deprived areas.Chart showing rates of hospital admissions for infectious diseases by quintile of deprivationThe analysis also revealed stark ethnic inequalities. Although admission rates were low overall for tuberculosis, emergency hospital admissions for the disease were 15 times higher for people from a black African background compared with those categorised as white British.It was also estimated that these inequalities in emergency admissions for infectious diseases cost the NHS in England between £970m and £1.5bn in 2022-23.Chart showing rates of hospital admissions for infectious diseases by ethnic groupProf David Taylor-Robinson, an academic co-director at Health Equity North and professor of public health and policy at the University of Liverpool, said: “This report echoes past research showing that deprived communities, typically in the North of England, bear the brunt of health inequalities.“It is particularly troubling to see the high number of hospital admissions due to infectious diseases, especially as some of these are preventable diseases.”He added: “Our previous analysis has shown that childhood vaccine uptake in England has plummeted among the most disadvantaged families. This is against a backdrop of cuts to local government, pressures on the NHS, and the growing number of children living in poverty.“Protecting children from vaccine-preventable diseases should be a public health priority, otherwise we will see more hospitalisations and deaths from these entirely preventable diseases.”Dr Leonora Weil, the interim deputy director for health equity and inclusion at UKHSA, said the report revealed some “stark” facts on the state of inequalities in health security faced by some people, “in particular those living in the most deprived communities and certain areas of the country, some ethnic groups, as well as excluded groups such as those experiencing homelessness.“These health-protection inequalities – where there are poorer health outcomes based on where you live, your socioeconomic status or ethnicity – are avoidable, pervasive and preventable. That is why it is so important to shine a light on these findings to increase action to support communities to live longer and in better health.”She added: “This report is just the start. We need to build on these insights, as only through persistent and dedicated effort across all health organisations will we make a real difference to helping all people live longer and in better health.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “This shocking report shows the appalling healthcare inequalities this government inherited.“Our Plan for Change is reforming the NHS to get it back on its feet so it is there for everyone, regardless of who they are or where they live.

(ABC News: Courtney Withers)It was meant to act as a mandatory extra level of safety.The GPS monitoring requirement would only be lifted in \"exceptional circumstances\", which former attorney-general John Quigley told parliament last year was a \"very high threshold\".But a letter made public yesterday revealed that, at least for a period, that \"very high threshold\" was simply just living outside of Perth.Cracks emergeAs far as we know, the first sign of trouble came three months after the laws took effect.On March 21, the Assistant Commissioner for Adult Community Corrections warned WA Police the Justice Department \"can no longer support or recommend the use of electronic monitoring\" under the new law \"in any location other than the Perth metropolitan area\".By this point, at the very latest, the government knew there were serious issues with the policy and that it could not be carried out in the way in which it had promised.Two-and-a-half weeks later, he wrote again to say the decision \"was predominantly made due to unacceptable risk to community safety in areas where we cannot guarantee a timely response to equipment issues\" — which included outer suburban Perth.Two days later, Corrective Services Commissioner Brad Royce confirmed the position in a letter to Police Commissioner Col Blanch, adding that there had been a \"significant increase\" in the number of people being electronically monitored because of the new laws.The Justice Department simply didn\\'t have the resources to assess each case individually and decide whether a GPS tracker would work given WA\\'s patchy mobile phone network.The government had been warned about this issue before it introduced its new laws because it had run a two-year trial.The final report of that trial noted assessment reports could take up to three weeks, and that “this may require additional resourcing”.The government initially allocated $28 million over four years for 35 staff, but in an indication that number was inadequate, a further 12 staff were added. They\\'re not due to start work until after June 30.Premier\\'s omissionsSubsequent media questions elicited carefully worded responses from the government.Premier Roger Cook told ABC Radio Perth \"I haven\\'t been advised that it\\'s a lack of resources\" behind the issues, instead blaming \"black spots\" that meant the technology could not be used in some areas.But he didn\\'t mention that the reason those black spots were such a concern was that the only way to know if they would impact a particular person was to have a Justice staffer assess that individual case.What Premier Roger Cook did not mention appears as significant as what he did. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)As Royce\\'s letter pointed out, that was not possible — hence the ban.Cook also didn\\'t mention the department\\'s inability to respond to issues like \"equipment failures, charging issues and signal loss\", suggesting the problems were simply a result of \"getting used to the systems\".It\\'s an assertion that struggles under the weight of these revelations.\"This is bigger than teething problems, this appears to be some kind of cover-up of the information that\\'s been shared between Commissioners and now not properly shared between the community,\" Shadow Corrective Services Minister Adam Hort said.The new letterThis week, Commissioner Royce wrote another, very carefully worded, letter.It\\'s nowhere near as direct as the earlier communication.It asks that \"additional conditions\" be considered by magistrates including curfews and home detention to \"aid the effectiveness\" of tracking, and observes the court could \"request a report from community corrections officers as to the suitability of electronic monitoring in relation to specific accused\".\"The department is ready and willing to assist with these requests,\" he notes.The implication seems to be — we can\\'t assess every case, but if you think there\\'ll be an issue, refer it to us and we\\'ll work it out.Falling short on a DV promiseIt seems GPS trackers are no longer subject to a blanket ban outside Perth, but the result still falls far short of the promise the government made to victim-survivors nearly a year ago.A mandatory extra level of safety meant to only be lifted in \"exceptional circumstances\" seems to be bypassed far more readily.The ankle monitors used by WA Police. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)There\\'s still no clear information on where the technology works and where it doesn\\'t, and whether issues assessing each case will be fixed by those 12 extra staff.And while ministers have lined up to criticise \"fearmongering\" by the opposition, genuine problems have now been highlighted which the government would have preferred the public didn\\'t know about.\"Be open with us, tell us what the gaps are, tell us how you\\'re going to fix the gaps,\" Hort urged yesterday.It\\'s now up to the government to do just that and restore trust in the policy it created.', 'location': 'AUS', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: WA domestic violence GPS monitoring program flawed\\nENTITIES: WA Government, John Quigley, Roger Cook, Brad Royce, Adam Hort\\nEVENT: WA's domestic violence strategy targeting repeat offenders, which involved GPS monitoring upon release on bail, faced implementation issues due to resource constraints and patchy mobile networks, leading to a restriction of the program to the Perth metropolitan area.\\nCONTEXT: WA's domestic violence GPS monitoring program flawed implementation.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-02T16:09:34.237Z'}, {'id': 42649, 'sourceId': 12549, 'url': 'https://www.buzzfeed.com/kristenharris1/90s-movies-trivia', 'title': \"'90s Movies Trivia\", 'publishDate': '2025-05-01T02:31:05.000Z', 'content': 'There was something different in the Hollywood air in the \\'90s. No matter what generation you\\'re part of, movies from that era just hit different.\\nHere are 40 interesting behind-the-scenes facts about iconic \\'90s movies:\\n1.\\nThe Leonardo DiCaprio-led Romeo + Juliet was filmed in Mexico, but the production could\\'ve been a movie itself. Director Baz Luhrmann told Arts Beat LA, \"Look, first let me say I would not swap a day that I spent in Mexico for anything in the world. It was the most adventurous time. Having said that, it is true we were there months longer than we needed to be. We had hurricanes that wiped out the set. We all got sick. Shooting shut down for a week while I had a temperature of 110. The hair and makeup person, Aldo Signoretti, who worked with [director Federico] Fellini, was kidnapped. We paid $US300 to get him back. I thought rather a bargain.\"\\nHe continued, \"I was not there; he was kidnapped. The bandidos rang up and said, \\'For $US300, you can have him back.\\' So Maurizio [Silvi, the makeup artist], who is about this high, goes down clutching the money to outside the hotel, holds it up, chucks them the bag, and they threw him out of the car and broke his leg. So we had adventures. It was an incredible quest. It wasn\\'t a walk in the park, and the fact that the kids did what they did and put up with what they did was amazing.\"\\n\"The reason the film is like it is, is that we embraced everything in the film. For example, Mercutio dies in that storm. Well, that was the hurricane that came and blew our sets away. The wide shots, which you could never get, I asked the guys if the cameras could handle it – we got out and did the wides and caught the storms, then we came back and did the close-ups with wind machines. For a budget of ours, which is between $15–17 million, you can\\'t achieve that short of massive CGIs,\" he said.\\n2.\\nDuring Titanic\\'s final shooting day in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, tens of cast and crew members were unwittingly drugged when they ate chowder spiked with the mind-altering substance PCP. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet weren\\'t on set that day, but Bill Paxton was among the poisoned. Director James Cameron told Q with Tom Power, \"This is a 100 percent true story. You haven\\'t lived until you\\'ve been high on PCP, which by the way, I do not recommend to anyone.\"\\nEveryone was rushed to the hospital under the initial concern that they might\\'ve eaten contaminated shellfish. James continued, \"There was an emergency room with no one in it and, like, a nurse, and 85 crew members walk in. We don\\'t know what\\'s going on. And basically, somebody had taken a pound of PCP and dumped it into the chowder...We have a pretty strong suspicion who it was, although it was never proven.\"\\n3.\\nTo test the believability of his Mrs. Doubtfire disguise, Robin Williams wore the costume to an adult store. He told Sirius XM, \"I was dressed as her in San Francisco, and I walked into a sex shop…I tried to buy a double-headed dildo, and I was going, \\'That one right there. The big one. Do you have anything without veins? Something without veins would be lovely\\'…and I can see this guy behind the counter going, \\'Whoa, this old lady.\\' \\'And a scented lube would be nice too. A sandalwood lube, something like that, for a probe.\\' And finally, the guy realized it was me and went, \\'Get out of here, Robin, you asshole!\\'\"\\n4.\\nInterview with the Vampire author Anne Rice was initially so opposed to Tom Cruise\\'s casting as Lestat de Lioncourt that she attended a protest against him at a bookstore. She told Esquire, \"I didn\\'t speak out in any organized or planned way. These people have stood in line for me three and four hours. They are my readers, and they hate this. I was carried along by my readers. I didn\\'t start the whole thing at all.\"\\nHowever, after the film came out, she praised him in an open letter, writing, \"From the moment he appeared, Tom was Lestat for me. He has the immense physical and moral presence; he was defiant and yet never without conscience; he was beautiful beyond description yet compelled to do cruel things. The sheer beauty of Tom was dazzling, but the polish of his acting, his flawless plunge into the Lestat persona, his ability to speak rather boldly poetic lines, and speak them with seeming ease and conviction were exhilarating and uplifting. The guy is great. I\\'m no good at modesty. I like to believe Tom\\'s Lestat will be remembered the way Olivier\\'s Hamlet is remembered. Others may play the role some day but no one will ever forget Tom\\'s version of it.\"\\n5.\\nClueless writer/director Amy Heckerling told Entertainment Weekly, \"When I auditioned the kids, I\\'d always ask them for new words. You know, slang and stuff. That\\'s where I got \\'going postal.\\' I loved calling someone a \\'Monet.\\' From far away, they\\'re fucking gorgeous, and up close, they\\'re totally different. \\'Betty\\' was based on Betty Rubble, who was very pretty. And Barney\\' is like, How did he get her? \\'As if\\' came from the lesbian community. Any outsider group is going to create their own language — whether it\\'s homosexual, Black, prisoners, or cabdrivers. You just have to be willing to open your ears and listen.\"\\nAlicia Silverstone added, \"I didn\\'t know what anything meant. I would have to say to Amy, \\'What does \\'As if\\' mean? She’\\'s way hipper than I am. I mean, \\'Surfing the crimson wave\\'?\\n6.\\nCher\\'s iconic yellow plaid outfit from Clueless is often imitated, never duplicated — but it almost didn\\'t happen because of Alicia\\'s hair! Costume designer Mona May told E! News, \"She had to shine. She had to jump out of the page, of the screen. We tried red and we tried blue, which is kind of like a more of a blond color, and nothing really had the pop, and when I found the yellow suit, the Dolce & Gabbana, and we put it on in the fitting, it was like sunshine, like a ray of sun just entered the room, and that was what Amy [Heckerling] loved, and everybody in the room reacted to it so incredibly because it really — you wouldn\\'t think of yellow for a blond girl…But, that really was the perfect thing to embody her in that first scene.\"\\n\"It had to be plaid. It\\'s just quintessential school. You\\'re taking this very much of a Catholic school uniform and now twisting it to high fashion and then transforming it yet again through the eyes of the high school girl,\" she said.\\n7.\\nThe Matrix production designer Simon Whiteley told CNET, \"I like to tell everybody that The Matrix\\'s code is made out of Japanese sushi recipes. Without that code, there is no Matrix.\" He later told Wired, \"The Wachowskis didn\\'t feel like the design was old-fashioned and traditional enough. They wanted something that was more Japanese, more manga. They asked me if I\\'d like to have a go working at the code, mainly because my wife is Japanese, and she could help me work out the characters and give me insight into which characters were good and which weren\\'t.\" At home, he went through \"stacks of Japanese cookbooks\" until he found the perfect one to base his code on.\\nHe continued, \"I\\'ve been kind of not wanting to tell anyone what the recipe book is, partly because that\\'s the last bit of magic...It\\'s not actually a book. It\\'s a magazine, but it\\'s called a book. It\\'s something most Japanese people would\\'ve heard of or have on their bookshelf.\"\\n8.\\nPer Yahoo, in the original Ghost script, Bruce Joel Rubin wrote Molly as a wood sculptor, not a potter. When director Jerry Zucker expressed concerns it might seem cliche, Bruce got the idea to make her do pottery when he saw a The Naked Gun sound editor reading a pottery magazine. Demi Moore took a few pottery lessons ahead of filming her famous scene with Patrick Swayze, but he didn\\'t know anything about pottery until rehearsals. During filming, pro potters started the pots that Demi finished on camera, but things still got messy. The iconic moment when Patrick joins her at the wheel and her pot collapses was totally unplanned. In a DVD featurette, Bruce said, \"Nobody expected [the pot] to fall. Demi recovered so quickly…She wasn\\'t angry, she wasn\\'t disappointed. In a way, the whole nature of their relationship was shown in that moment.\"\\n9.\\nPer Metro, in the Home Alone scene where Marv walks barefoot through the snow, Daniel Stern wore fake feet because of the cold. He told ComicBook.com, \"I do get asked a lot, \\'Was that a real tarantula on your face? What\\'s Joe Pesci like? Did it hurt when you got hit in the face with the iron?’\\' That one, I guess getting hit in the face, \\'Did it hurt when you got hit in the face with the bricks?\\' I think maybe that one. When people started asking me that, I went, \\'You know it\\'s fake, right? There\\'s a prop department. I didn\\'t get hit in the face with bricks.\\' They’re like, \\'Oh.\\' The believability of it is wonderful, but it did concern me to a point when that movie first came out actually, that I started teaching a course in media literacy.\"\\n10.\\nIn Pretty Woman, the scene where Edward closes the jewelry box on Vivian\\'s hand was actually an unscripted prank on Julia Roberts! Director Gary Marshall told DGA Quarterly Magazine, \"This was not actually a scene written into the movie — rather a prank I played on Julia with Richard\\'s help. Why, you may ask, would I fool around when \\'time is money?\\' The reason is simple: while making a film there are, believe it or not, \\'rotten days,\\' \\'cranky days,\\' and \\'stupid, absurd days.\\' Days when the actors are sluggish from late-night parties and premieres, or from shooting too many days in a row. And sometimes the crew is tired from too hot, too cold, too rainy or too many long days. I find the solution to this problem is to do pranks and jokes.\"\\nHe continued, \"Other directors use yelling or pep talks or firing people to shake up a shoot. My sister Penny sometimes uses begging, á la, \\'Please, please everybody, act better. I have a stomachache and a headache, and I wanna wrap and go home.\\' Kidding around works best for me. For instance, during Julia\\'s bubble bath scene in Pretty Woman when she went under the soapy water for a few moments, Richard Gere, myself, and the entire crew disappeared and were gone when she came up. It was just her in a tub on a ghost ship. And I also started a rumor during that scene that I had put goldfish in the bathtub, and everybody, including Julia, was looking for the fish.\"\\n11.\\nThe chewing tobacco in The Sandlot was \"actually shredded beef jerky and black licorice.\" Actor Grant Gelt told The Arrow, \"They didn\\'t tell us about the licorice, which, looking back, I think was intended to actually make us feel nauseous. David [Mickey Evans, the director] wanted to capture that immediate sharp reaction of, \\'Holy shit, this is terrible. What were we thinking?\\' After a summer of David and the crew having to put up with us, I think that night was a good way for them to get revenge.\" Prop master Terry Haskell added, \"That was a real tobacco brand, and yep, the black jerky and licorice was me. I absolutely wanted them to feel revolted.\"\\n12.\\nCarrie Fisher and George Lucas had secret cameos in Hook! According to The Wrap, filmmakers confirmed they appeared as a couple on the bridge that Tinker Bell enchants.\\n13.\\nIn The Truman Show, Truman\\'s iconic catchphrase (and the final line of the movie) — \"Good morning! And in case I don\\'t see you, good afternoon, good evening, and good night\" — was the brainchild of Jim Carrey. Writer Andrew Niccol told The Hollywood Reporter, \"I think it was originally an ad-lib by Jim, but yes, the duplicitous Christof seized on it and directed the extras in Truman\\'s life to pretend to be amused...For a while, I think the last line was, \\'You never had a camera in my head.\\'\"\\n14.\\nIn the Forrest Gump scene where the protagonist gives a speech at an anti-Vietnam protest, you can\\'t hear what Tom Hanks is saying. Screenwriter Eric Roth told Yahoo Entertainment, \"[Director Robert Zemeckis] never liked the speech I had Forrest Gump give when he was given the microphone at that event. He said, \\'We need something that\\'s way funnier and way more important.\\' Funnier I tried, and I even enlisted some comedians. I asked Billy Crystal to help me, I asked Robin [Williams], [some] other people. And nothing ever resonated. And then I tried to write some big glorious speech about patriotism and Vietnam. It was a really wonderful American speech. And that didn\\'t quite work. So Bob came up with the solution of he starts speaking, and they pull the plug.\"\\n15.\\nReese Witherspoon helped rewrite parts of the Cruel Intentions script. Her costar (and boyfriend at the time of filming) Ryan Philippe told Entertainment Weekly, \"She loved the movie for me, but it wasn\\'t a great part at the time for her. She helped Roger [Kumble, the writer/director] turn it into one.\" Roger said, \"It\\'s true, she came and sat with me for a week, and we worked on the dialogue together. Annette was the character most removed from me. There\\'s no way the movie would have its success if it weren\\'t for [Reese\\'s] talent as a writer.\"\\nReese added, \"I remember finding Annette too demure and too much of a woman influenced by a guy\\'s manipulations. I was starting what I guess became my bigger mission in life — of questioning why women were written certain ways on film.\"\\n16.\\nAccording to Digital Spy, She\\'s All That was filmed in the same high school as Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Torrance High School, which is in California). There\\'s another connection between the two — Buffy star Sarah Michelle Gellar made a cameo in She\\'s All That! And of course, she went on to marry the lead of the movie, Freddie Prinze Jr.\\n17.\\nIn Addams Family Values, Fester is significantly shorter than Gomez, but in real life, actor Christopher Lloyd is only an inch shorter than Raúl Juliá. Christopher told BuzzFeed, \"I always had my knees bent to make me look shorter and more squat. It worked out well because it gave me kind of a funny walk.\"\\n18.\\nThe Pasadena house that was used for the exterior shots in Father of the Bride became a real-life wedding venue when the owners, Sarah Bradley and Darrell Spence, used it to host their wedding reception. They purchased the home in 1999 and tied the knot a little under a year later. Sarah told HGTV, \"When I gave [the event planner] our address, she said, \\'Oh, you\\'re near the Father of the Bride house.\\' I said, ‘No, we are the Father of the Bride house.\\' She said the excited planner shouted, \"I\\'m going to be Franck!\"\\nAdditionally, fans love to visit the house — and some even propose there. Once, on the way home from a walk with their two kids, the couple decided to hang back as a proposal unfolded. Sarah said, \"I saw the guy on one knee and told Darrell, \\'We can\\'t go over there with a screaming child.\\' They\\'ll be like, \\'Forget it!\\'\"\\n19.\\nFranck, the eccentric wedding planner in Father of the Bride, was reportedly inspired by Kevin Lee, a celebrity wedding and event planner who\\'s worked with clients such as Kim Kardashian, Nic Cage, and Jennifer Aniston. He told The Daily Dish that a producer informed him of the inspiration. He said, \"Oh yeah, absolutely it was me! I said, \\'Wow.\\' I was totally shocked when he told me that...[Martin Short] captured my character so well, and I was overwhelmed. Officially, I am the Franck.\"\\n20.\\nIn Romy and Michele\\'s High School Reunion, the triangular symbol on Romy\\'s blue dress is a hidden Star Trek reference. Costume designer Mona May told Nylon she wanted a \"slick\" and \"futuristic\" look, so she added the Star Fleet insignia-esque symbol. She said, \"I didn\\'t want to make it too plain or put stars all over it or anything weird, so it was just enough.\"\\n21.\\nFriends costars Courteney Cox and Lisa Kudrow unintentionally wore the same red Moschino jacket in two of their most iconic \\'90s movie roles. Courteney wore it during the climax of Scream, and Lisa wore it during Romy & Michele’s High School Reunion. Scream costume designer Cynthia Bergstrom told Nylon, \"It was funny because Mona and I were at the same time at [Neiman Marcus] in Beverly Hills, and we looked at that Moschino, and we both went for it. She put the jacket with a different skirt, and I bought it as a suit and kept it together. But it was really funny when we were shopping. I\\'d look over and see what she had in her arms, and she\\'d look and see what I had. It was so much fun.\"\\n22.\\nMacaulay Culkin\\'s role in My Girl was originally smaller. Director Howard Zieff told Entertainment Weekly, \"Mack and Anna [Chlumsky] were just two kids working together on a movie. Mack didn\\'t have the attitude \\'I\\'m a star and you\\'re not.’\\' We added two or three more scenes with him because as he began to work with her, there was terrific synergy.\"\\n23.\\nIn Thelma & Louise, Geena Davis\\'s real-life ex-boyfriend, Chris McDonald, played her onscreen husband on her recommendation. According to WLIW, she told director Ridley Scott that Chris was \"the funniest guy in the world.\" His humor was on full display during his audition, and it carried into production. While filming a scene where he walks to the car, Chris accidentally tripped, but his comedic timing was so perfect that the shot stayed in the final cut.\\n24.\\nThe lead character in Sister Act was originally named Terri, but screenwriter Paul Rudnick told the New Yorker, \"Whoopi Goldberg was suddenly eager to play the part of Terri, although she asked that the character’s name be changed to Deloris, because, I was told, she’d always wanted to play someone named Deloris.\"\\n25.\\nPer Yahoo, the effects in Death Becomes Her were a groundbreaking mix of computer graphics and practical effects. Here\\'s an example: for Meryl Streep\\'s head spin scene, she filmed the scene facing backwards on set. Later, at the Industrial Light and Magic studio, she wore a blue bodysuit and sat in a chair while performing with only her head. The two shots were combined in post-production.\\nVisual effects art director Doug Chiang told Yahoo, \"A lot of those things involved shooting elements after the fact, and choreographing it very carefully so that her expressions matched her body poses. And it was a very delicate thing. In hindsight, it\\'s very, very complex, whereas today we would probably do most of that visually. But back then, it was still old-school, because we were blending traditional techniques with the new tools that we had in computer graphics.\"\\n26.\\nAccording to Screen Rant, during the height of his professional rivalry with Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger read the terrible script for Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot, then he spread a rumor about having \"tremendous interest\" in it, which he knew would prompt Sylvester to accept the lead role. Sylvester described the movie as \"one of the worst films in the entire solar system, including alien productions we’ve never seen.\" It earned him his fourth Razzie for Worst Actor.\\n27.\\nGroundhog Day is famously set in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, but it was actually filmed in Woodstock, Illinois. Director Harold Ramis told Collider, \"We didn\\'t use Punxsutawney for the film because Punxsutawney itself didn\\'t have a real town center that looked very good on camera, so we wanted a town that looked perfect, so the town you\\'ll see is Woodstock, IL. We scouted all of southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois looking for the perfect town, and we pulled into Woodstock just the way the van pulls into town in the movie. It was the last town we saw, and we looked at this little town square and thought, \\'Aw, this is perfect.\\'\" He also said that the people of Punxsutawney \"were very jealous that the movie wasn’t shot in Punxsutawney, but when they saw Woodstock, they thought it looked better than their town.\"\\n28.\\nAccording to Screen Rant, one of the two animatronic cats used for Thackery Binx in Hocus Pocus was reused as Salem Saberhagen in Sabrina the Teenage Witch. Nick Bakay, who voiced Salem, told Vanity Fair, \"ABC did not love the animatronic cat. And I get it: it\\'s not like it was going to fool anyone. But I think that it was part of the charm of the show—quaint, old-school, practical magic and weird cat puppets. And for some reason, it kind of worked.\"\\n29.\\nAccording to Screen Rant, CGI was only used for six minutes of Jurassic Park. Most of the dinosaurs were created using practical effects, such as puppets and animatronics. For example, the sick triceratops that Ellie Sattler interacts closely with is a gigantic puppet with hand-sculpted skin and control rods beneath its flanks.\\n30.\\nSpeed director Jan de Bont told HuffPost that his \"biggest aim was making it all look real\" — which led to Sandra Bullock actually driving the bus through the street! There was stunt driver in the back, but she wasn\\'t on a studio lot or in front of a green screen. According to USA Today, she got a Santa Monica bus driver\\'s license for the role. She said, \"I was at the wheel of projectile. So I was just happy to be alive. I was new to the whole game, so I wasn\\'t aware of what was happening or what felt right. We were just in it. It was real. When we were smashing into things (on screen), we were really smashing into those things.\"\\n31.\\nRobin Williams improvised many of his lines as the Genie in Aladdin. In a Reddit AMA, he said, \"Initially I was just doing the scripted lines and I asked \\'Do you mind if I try something?\\' and then 18 hours of recording later, they had the genie. I just started playing, and they said \\'just go with it, go with it, go with it.\\' So I improvised the character. I think that in the end, there were something like 40 different voices that I did for that role.\"\\n32.\\nSpace Jam was initially the brainchild of David Falk, Michael Jordan\\'s agent, who\\'d initially kept the NBA legend away from the silver screen. He told the New York Times, \"We got piles of scripts. But they didn\\'t fit Michael Jordan. He can\\'t really act. And you have to know your limitations.\\'\\'\\n33.\\nMike Meyers told Newsweek that the Austin Powers cast was allowed to \"do their own thing.\" He said, \"About 30 to 40 percent is improv.\"\\n34.\\nRichard E. Grant didn\\'t want to be in the Spice Girls movie, but his daughter made him. He told Vulture, \"When my daughter was 9, I got offered the part in Spice World, and she said I had to do it. \\'But my acting credibility…\\' And she\\'d say, \\'No, no, you have to. You have to because I want to meet them.\\' So I did, and she was so thrilled. I had school playground credibility for about two semesters, and then, of course, you dip into the other side when they go, \\'No, I was never a Spice Girls fan!\\' Now that generation has all come back around again going, \\'Yeah, we love the Spice Girls!\\'\"\\nHe continued, \"In essence, a similar thing happened when I got called to be in one episode of Girls. My daughter literally levitated. She\\'s a creative writing degree student, and she said, \\'You have no idea what it would mean if I could meet or be in the same room or breathe the same air as Lena Dunham.\\' I feel as a father if I\\'ve done anything right at all, I\\'ve done both the Spice Girls movie and Girls.\"\\n35.\\nLindsay Lohan and Simon Kunz choreographed their iconic The Parent Trap handshake themselves. He told Bustle, \"The first time [Lindsay and I] met up, we worked on the handshake idea, about what it could be. I think I\\'d done something in the audition, just mucking about without Lindsay there, just doing silly moves. They liked a few of those, and so we basically spent an afternoon, two or three hours really, just working out that routine...If you ask me right now [to do it], I\\'d know one or two bits there, but I tell you what, it would only take me 20 minutes, and then I\\'d have it absolutely down pat.\"\\n36.\\nChristopher McDonald \"nearly didn\\'t do\" Happy Gilmore — and he actually turned down the role of Shooter McGavin twice. He told And So It Begins, \"I was tired. I wanted to see more of my family. But then I played a round of golf in Seattle, and we won. And that high was something else. So, with my golf shoes still on, I went in the locker room, called my agent, and said, \\'Is that golf movie still available? Because I just won this tournament and I\\'m feeling a little bit, well, Shooterish.\\' So I met Adam [Sandler], because I didn\\'t know if the guy who did Opera Man was going to be any good.

It is not what you think it is. It is how other people assess it and you.Imagine you are a fly on the wall, listening to a group of people who know you well and are speaking about you from a personal and a professional perspective. What do they say about how you present yourself, your character, your strengths and weaknesses, your special traits and attributes?Whether you like it or not, how people perceive you in the workplace is essential for career development.Credit: What is your reputation, and how are you differentiated you from your peers? The summary of their responses is your personal brand.Our modern, online world provides plenty of opportunities to add or subtract from your personal brand in the workplace. Here are five tips to help you strategically build a strong personal brand in the digital age.1. Identify your purposeStart by asking yourself what exactly you are hoping to achieve by building your personal brand. Who are you trying to impress and why? Are you trying to build your profile within your organisation, industry or the world at large?Are you trying to get a promotion or a new job? Are you aiming to win new business for yourself or your organisation? Are you seeking to position yourself as an expert, go-to person in a specialised field? Once you are clear on your purpose, you can plan.2. Have a plan Curating a personal brand should be done in a thoughtful, methodical manner. The place to start is by getting a handle on what your personal brand is right now. Ask any mentors and other people you know well and trust questions like these: How would you describe my personal brand right now?What adjectives best sum up my personal brand in your mind? What could I start doing, continue doing or stop doing, to help me build a strong and credible personal brand?LoadingIf the people you approach are stumped by the term “personal brand”, replace it with “reputation”. Once you have assessed your current brand, you are in a better place to plan how to enhance it.3. Start offlineMost discussion on personal branding focuses on how you present yourself to the wider world. However, your personal brand starts with how you wish to be perceived in your own organisation and with people you come into actual contact within your job.That is, in the offline real world. Doing first-rate work, meeting agreed deadlines, building relationships, communicating well, and being a pleasant and cheerful human being will go a very long way towards building your personal brand. Not only do such activities not take any extra time, but you get paid to do them as part of your job.4. Choose online platforms carefullyThe usefulness of an online presence will depend on your profession, job, organisation and circumstances. There is no one-size-fits-all. The two usual places for professionals to build an online presence are their own organisation’s website and LinkedIn.You always have a personal brand – whether it be good, bad or indifferent.Only when those two are working well is it worth exploring the multitude of other online platforms and maybe setting up your own website. Take your lead from senior professionals in your organisation and in organisations similar to yours who appear to be digitally savvy. And look at what your peers and competitors are doing.Producing quality posts can take time but be careful not to overinvest. In deciding how often to post, again, be guided by others in your sector.LoadingSometimes you will see exhortations such as, “Make a commitment to post every single day for at least one year”. If you think that is a great use of your time, knock yourself out. Frankly, I would rather commit to visiting the dentist every single day for a year.5. Get feedbackAs the saying goes, breakfast is the feedback of champions. Seek out feedback occasionally from your colleagues and clients on what they value about your online efforts.If they are honest, they will probably tell you that simply reposting your organisation’s material, will be of little interest to anyone, apart perhaps from the business development people in your organisation who like to keep statistics on these things.Come up with original material that is interesting and relevant to your colleagues, contacts, clients and competitors. This need not be lengthy. You should present as insightful and original. Perhaps comment briefly and incisively on some current development of interest in your sector.You always have a personal brand – whether it be good, bad or indifferent. With a bit of planning you can uncover the status of your personal brand and set about enhancing it in a strategic, thoughtful manner. In the digital age you will want to boost your personal brand with an online presence. However, start in the offline, real world.If you do shoddy work, miss deadlines, and fail to build relationships and communicate well, then no amount of LinkedIn or other social media posts will be of much use.Tony Frost, author of The Professional: A Playbook to Unleash Your Potential and Futureproof Your Success is a speaker, executive coach, trainer and author.', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Build your reputation at work strategically\\nENTITIES: Tony Frost, LinkedIn\\nEVENT: The article provides five tips for building a strong personal brand in the workplace, emphasizing the importance of offline interactions and strategic online presence.\\nCONTEXT: Building a strong personal brand requires offline and online strategies.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-02T16:09:34.237Z'}, {'id': 42077, 'sourceId': 12484, 'url': 'https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/premier-league-soccer-stream-man-city-vs-wolves-live-from-anywhere/#ftag=CAD590a51e', 'title': 'Premier League Soccer: Stream Man City vs. Wolves Live From Anywhere', 'publishDate': '2025-05-02T00:00:03.000Z', 'content': 'Why You Can Trust CNET Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks.

Quick tips for streaming the Premier League using a VPN\\xa0With four variables at play -- your ISP, browser, video streaming provider and VPN -- your experience and success when streaming EPL matches may vary.If you don\\'t see your desired location as a default option for ExpressVPN, try using the \"search for city or country\" option.If you\\'re having trouble getting the game after you\\'ve turned on your VPN and set it to the correct viewing area, there are two things you can try for a quick fix. First, log into your streaming service subscription account and make sure the address registered for the account is an address in the correct viewing area. If not, you may need to change the physical address on file with your account. Second, some smart TVs -- like Roku -- don\\'t have VPN apps you can install directly on the device itself. Instead, you\\'ll have to install the VPN on your router or the mobile hotspot you\\'re using (like your phone) so that any device on its Wi-Fi network now appears in the correct viewing location.All of the VPN providers we recommend have helpful instructions on their main site for quickly installing the VPN on your router. In some cases with smart TV services, after you install a cable network\\'s sports app, you\\'ll be asked to verify a numeric code or click a link sent to your email address on file for your smart TV. This is where having a VPN on your router will also help, since both devices will appear to be in the correct location.\\xa0And remember, browsers can often give away a location despite using a VPN, so be sure you\\'re using a privacy-first browser to log into your services.

In her lawsuit, the Gossip Girl alum accused Baldoni of sexually harassing her in multiple ways - including body shaming her - and orchestrating a smear campaign against her to damage her reputation.Baldoni and his reps have said in response to the lawsuit that Lively twisted the meaning of text messages and mislead the public about their interactions while making the motion picture.In her lawsuit, Lively named a number of Baldoni\\'s collaborators, including his company Wayfarer Studios, the studio\\'s CEO and financial backer, and PR personnel Melissa Nathan and Jennifer Abel.\\'I hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted,\\' Lively told The New York Times the day after she filed the complaint.Baldoni subsequently sued the newspaper for $250 million in a defamation claim over a December 21 story titled \\'\"We Can Bury Anyone\": Inside a Hollywood Smear Machine;\\' the newspaper has denied the allegations.

The company, the last outfit to make steel from scratch in the UK, employs about 3,500 people in the UK, including 2,700 at Scunthorpe.\\xa0“The amount of working capital provided for British Steel to date stands at £94mn, which is considerably less, of course, than if we had given a large amount of money to Jingye, or if we had to deal with the complete loss of the entire British Steel site and business,” he told MPs.Reynolds said that the money spent so far was a lot less than if ministers had allowed the “total collapse” of British Steel, which he said would have cost £1bn. It was also less than the £1.2bn that Jingye had requested in financial support to keep its lossmaking operations running while switching to greener forms of steelmaking, he said.\\xa0Andrew Griffith, shadow business secretary, warned that the rescue could end up costing taxpayers billions of pounds in the long run.“Isn’t the truth that sooner or later, this will have to come from his department’s budget at the expense of financial support for the automotive sector, for exporters, or hard-working trade negotiators?” the Conservative MP asked in the Commons on Thursday.\\xa0Ministers have repeatedly said that they have a “war chest” of £2.5bn to spend on green steel, which could come from the state-owned National Wealth Fund.\\xa0Griffith questioned the idea that the cash could come from the National Wealth Fund, which despite being state-owned is operationally independent.The Labour government hopes to be able to find a new buyer for British Steel from the private sector, though analysts are sceptical about the prospects of a swift sale given losses that owner Jingye had estimated at £700,000 a day.Ministers stepped in with emergency legislation last month to seize control of the plants after Jingye announced plans to close the Scunthorpe blast furnaces and axe thousands of workers. \\xa0Closure would have left the UK as the only G7 nation without the ability to make steel from raw materials, although the Scunthorpe plant relies on imports of iron ore and coking coal to keep running.\\xa0Ministers had been discussing with Jingye plans to close the blast furnaces and replace them with electric arc furnaces that would recycle steel rather than making steel from scratch.\\xa0A similar deal was struck with India’s Tata covering its site at Port Talbot in south Wales, which has led to the closure of two blast furnaces there.\\xa0Jingye had asked for £1.2bn towards its proposed £2bn project to switch to green steelmaking. It walked away when the government offered just £500mn.The business was previously taken into state control in 2019 by the then-Conservative government before being sold to Jingye for a nominal sum. Its 10 months in temporary nationalisation in 2019 it cost taxpayers £600mn.\\xa0Officials and other industry experts are preparing an “investment case” to attract a third-party buyer for British Steel, but the business secretary has said that nationalisation of the company remains a “likely option”.', 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: UK spends £94mn on British Steel rescue\\nENTITIES: UK government, British Steel, Jingye, Jonathan Reynolds, Andrew Griffith\\nEVENT: The UK government has spent £94mn to keep British Steel running after seizing control from Jingye.

But it’s about applying themselves for the full 80 minutes.”Walters said suspensions and injuries had also hampered the Panthers so far in 2025, with Mitch Kenny sidelined due to a two-game ban and a shoulder issue.Does Cleary deserve an Origin call up? | 04:18Dylan Edwards and Nathan Cleary have also sat out at different stages, forcing Penrith’s depth to be tested after a raft of poaching raids left their squad decimated.Jarome Luai and James Fisher-Harris departed ahead of the 2025 season and before that, Matt Burton, Viliame Kikau, Api Koroisau and Stephen Crichton also moved on.Throw into the mix rival NRL clubs picking at their pathways, with the likes of Keegan Russell-Smith, Luke Hanson and Isaiah Iongi being highly touted before being plucked away.“The Storm have been continually raided over the years, and the Broncos to a degree, but the Panthers the last four years have been the club under the most pressure,” Walters said.“Their salary cap and releasing players. You could put a team together that have left the Panthers and they would beat most teams today.“That’s been a tough one to get their head around, to continually produce the talent that comes out of their systems is amazing.“They’ve got that talent still today coming through, they just might need a little bit longer this time given the last four years and how they’ve lost players.“It’s amazing what they’ve built there in Penrith and they continue to develop players and bring them into first grade, and then they lose them because they can’t keep them all.”So if Cleary can fix their discipline and their big-name stars can stay on the park, Walters is confident they can make a push for finals.However, the importance of one man could be paramount — Liam Martin.The 28-year-old back rower is Penrith’s spiritual leader and the former Broncos coach said he could inspire this Panthers side back to the promised land.“The Panthers as a whole, they’ve just been a little bit down across a few markers. But when he’s got his game on, he’s one of the best second-rowers in the competition,” Walters said.Liam Martin of the Panthers is tackled during the round seven NRL match between Sydney Roosters and Penrith Panthers at Allianz Stadium, on April 19, 2025, in Sydney, Australia. (Photo by Cameron Spencer/Getty Images)Source: Getty Images“His leadership is something that the Panthers are looking to at the moment. I love the way he goes about his football... if he can bring it most weeks, it puts the Panthers in a strong position.“He’s been one of their strongest players over the last four or five years... defensive speed, line speed all that stuff (he excels in). “He’s an aggressive style of footballer and loves the contact as such and I am sure he will be enjoying himself on Sunday against the Broncos.“What’s first and foremost in their hands is getting back to the Panthers style. When they get back to that, the wins will come.“It could all turn around this weekend for them against the Broncos. I was foolish enough early in the season to write them off in a game. I won’t be doing that again.”Penrith, however, don’t have much room for error.Historically, 14 wins guarantees a spot in the finals, while the Titans were able to scrape in during the 2021 season with just 10 victories.Therefore, Cleary’s outfit must win between 10-12 of their remaining 16 games to be in the hunt.“It’s getting very tight for them from a win-loss perspective, so they certainly need to win and that starts this weekend. Can they win against the Broncos? 100 per cent they can,” Walters said.2025 Magic Round officially sold out! | 00:23MORE NRL NEWS‘TWICE ON SUNDAY’: Broncos legend backs club to re-sign Cobbo over Reynolds‘NOT THAT EASY’: Players hit back at tackle technique claims amid NRL crackdownEXTRA TIME: The real reason behind May’s Roosters exit; Reyno open to rival offersHOOPS: More boardroom bloodshed at Tigers as heated meeting sparks shake-up“They just have to bring their best football for the 80 minutes. I’m sure the Broncos, if they bring their best football, as well would be confident.“It shapes as a great match-up on Sunday afternoon up here at Suncorp.”The Broncos, meanwhile, have found patches of success under new coach Michael Maguire, who replaced Walters after the 2024 season. A pair of surprising losses against the Roosters and Warriors was followed by their best performance to date against the Bulldogs, who had won six straight before the clash.Again, few know the inner workings of the Broncos more than Walters — who is almost certain they will be contending for a premiership under their new mentor.“They are in a premiership window,” he said.“Their last match against the Bulldogs was very impressive, the way they came out and started. They’ve had good patches this year and also some that haven’t been quite as good.“The Raiders and Roosters games come to mind, and over in New Zealand.

Kosmos 482 was an attempted Venus space probe launched by the Soviets in 1972.\\xa0It failed to escape low Earth orbit due to a malfunction and the probe has been circulating Earth since.\\xa0Scientists estimate it will reenter Earth's atmosphere next week - potentially hitting an inhabited area.\\xa0 Friction between the capsule and atmospheric particles will eventually slow its descent to a couple hundred miles per hour, he added.\\xa0The capsule was also designed with a parachute system to slow its descent, but McDowell thinks it's 'completely impossible' that it's going to operate.\\xa0Therefore it's 'just going to slam into the ground', the expert said, like 'a car falling out of the air at 100 to 200 miles per hour'.\\xa0Despite this,\\xa0the odds of Kosmos 482 actually hitting you or your home are incredibly slim – mostly because the majority of Earth is not covered with people – meaning 'you do not have to lose any sleep over this'.\\xa0'If you land something in a random part of the Earth, the chance that it hits a person is about one in 10,000,' the expert said.\\xa0'The chance that it hits you is then one in 10 billion\\xa0– smaller than that.'Marco Langbroek, an astronomer at TU Delft in the Netherlands, estimates the reentry will occur between May 7-13, but mostly likely the 9th or 10th.\\xa0While it's exact point of reentry is unconfirmed, it could come down anywhere between 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south latitude.'This includes much of south and mid-latitude Europe and Asia, as well as the Americas and the whole of Africa and Australia,'\\xa0Langbroek said. This wouldn't be the first time a satellite has crash landed on Earth. In 2019, a Samsung satellite crash landed in a Michigan family's backyard It wouldn't be the first time that so-called 'space junk' has crash-landed in an inhabited area.\\xa0Last year, a mysterious ring of fiery debris from a launch rocket crashed down in a Kenyan village, although fortunately there were no reports of injuries.\\xa0And a smartphone-sized chunk of garbage jettisoned from the International Space Station (ISS) failed to burn up during its descent through Earth's atmosphere, falling through the roof of a home in Florida.\\xa0Back in 2019, a Samsung satellite crash landed in a Michigan family's backyard, still in an impressive state of preservation.\\xa0Dr James Blake, a space debris researcher at the University of Warwick, said there are thousands of active and defunct satellites orbiting the Earth.\\xa0 'This is a fate that awaits uncontrolled satellites and debris that can no longer counteract the drag forces exerted by the Earth's atmosphere,' he previously told MailOnline.'Indeed, operators are encouraged to speed up the re-entry of their defunct satellites to keep space clear for future missions.'WHAT IS SPACE JUNK? MORE THAN 170 MILLION PIECES OF DEAD SATELLITES, SPENT ROCKETS AND FLAKES OF PAINT POSE 'THREAT' TO SPACE INDUSTRYThere are an estimated 170 million pieces of so-called 'space junk' - left behind after missions that can be as big as spent rocket stages or as small as paint flakes - in orbit alongside some US$700 billion (£555bn) of space infrastructure.But only 27,000 are tracked, and with the fragments able to travel at speeds above 16,777 mph (27,000kmh), even tiny pieces could seriously damage or destroy satellites.However, traditional gripping methods don't work in space, as suction cups do not function in a vacuum and temperatures are too cold for substances like tape and glue.Grippers based around magnets are useless because most of the debris in orbit around Earth is not magnetic. Most proposed solutions, including debris harpoons, either require or cause forceful interaction with the debris, which could push those objects in unintended, unpredictable directions.Scientists point to two events that have badly worsened the problem of space junk.The first was in February 2009, when an Iridium telecoms satellite and Kosmos-2251, a Russian military satellite, accidentally collided.The second was in January 2007, when China tested an anti-satellite weapon on an old Fengyun weather satellite.Experts also pointed to two sites that have become worryingly cluttered.One is low Earth orbit which is used by satnav satellites, the ISS, China's manned missions and the Hubble telescope, among others.The other is in geostationary orbit, and is used by communications, weather and surveillance satellites that must maintain a fixed position relative to Earth.\", 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Soviet satellite Kosmos 482 to fall to Earth\\nENTITIES: Kosmos 482, Jonathan McDowell, Marco Langbroek, ESA, Russia\\nEVENT: Defunct Soviet Kosmos 482 satellite expected to reenter Earth's atmosphere between May 7-13, posing a small risk of impact.\\nCONTEXT: Risk of being hit is low due to Earth's surface composition.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-02T16:09:34.237Z'}, {'id': 46485, 'sourceId': 12816, 'url': 'https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/state-of-origin/womens-state-of-origin-2025-nsw-sky-blues-vs-queensland-maroons-preview-guide-how-series-will-work-format-teams-dates-allie-brigginshaw-ellie-johnston-tamika-upton/news-story/47f1d9bedce0126831bf2f3f84979dd2', 'title': '‘Extremely stressful’: Stars call for change as staggering problem hits women’s Origin series', 'publishDate': '2025-05-01T05:57:00.000Z', 'content': \"The 2025 Women’s State of Origin campaign kicks off on Thursday night with players facing the unknown amid a unique build-up to the new series format this season.

For Free and confidential support call 1800 858 858 or visit gamblinghelponline.org.au.Many of the players have no footy under their belts after Queensland followed NSW and now has a BMD Premiership in line with NRLW season. In essence BMD becomes the reserve grade for the NRLW where players who don’t make the NRLW side can stay fit and get match ready if needed for a call-up to first grade. NRLW coaches will use the BMD Premierships in Queensland and NSW to create competition for spots in their NRLW teams and add depth to their sides during the season. While the new system will vastly improve the depth of the NRL competition, the late start means players won’t have much match fitness ahead of an intriguing Origin series opener on May 1. Queensland champion Ali Brigginshaw admitted the scheduling isn’t ideal heading into one of the biggest games on the women’s rugby league calendar. “Definitely the scheduling is a problem,” Brigginshaw told AAP.

I don’t think anyone realises the stress we go through with the stuff we put our bodies through to make sure we are ready for this match.“Right now we are ready to get into it. We don’t complain. We move forward. Hopefully we can change it.”NSW prop Ellie Johnston agreed State of Origin should be played after a series of NRLW games to get players match ready and also allow them to compete for spots based on form. “I think it could be played after we’ve had a few games under our belts to make the game even stronger,” Johnston said. “Obviously we have had a six-week pre-season to get us ready but if we were playing (NRLW) we wouldn’t have that. I think pushing Origin back would be better.“I think we need a longer NRLW season. Our off-season is so long and us as individuals have to do our own training and running programs. That is hard to do for five to six months.”Blues prop Ellie Johnston has called for a longer NRLW season.Source: Getty ImagesMaroons co-captain Tamika Upton called for Origin to be played during or after the NRLW season. “I think it needs to be on when we are on-form and playing,” Upton said. “Even for the selectors it is quite hard to pick girls off a selection trial. When you are in season you are fit and at your peak. You have footy behind you and you have form.“The way the women’s game is at the moment you just have to be adaptable. I feel like because of Vegas we have done a few pre-seasons. We prepped and got ready individually for Vegas and then coming off the back of that you have to prep again for Origin.”However, as the Women’s game continues to evolve and grow Upton praised the professionalism of the players in trying to put the best product on the field as possible, no matter their preparation. “I just think at the moment where the scheduling is at you have to be adaptable and all the women playing in this series are harsh on ourselves and the quality we put forward in the games,” Upton said. “I know we were disappointed with the quality a couple of years ago with the first game because we hadn’t played much footy so a lot of players have taken it upon themselves in terms of their own individual prep.“You can’t come in underdone at all. It’s the best of the best and gets faster.”Blues star Chapman set for return | 01:04PREPARATIONBoth NSW and QLD have had different approaches to the build up and preparation with this series being uncharted territory for both sides this year. NSW coach John Strange arranged a six week training block with three sessions a week (Tuesday, Thursday 5-7pm and Saturdays 9-11am) in the build-up to the series. Players flew in from all over Australia, including Simaima Taufa from Canberra, Kira Dibb from Townsville and Jaime Chapman and Shaylee Bent from the Gold Coast.Jakiya Whitfeld flew in from Townsville and Grace Kemp from Canberra for the sessions and unfortunately still didn’t make the squad showing the commitment of the players in and outside the team.

Game one will be on Thursday May 1 at Suncorp Stadium at 7:45pm AEST as part of The NRL’s Magic Round in Brisbane in Round 9. Historically the game has tried to give Women standalone State of Origin fixtures in order to emphasise and celebrate the women’s game on a night dedicated to them. The second game of the series will be on May 15 at Allianz Stadium at 7:45pm AEST, while the third and potentially series deciding game will be at the same time on May 29 at McDonald Jones Stadium in Newcastle, the night after the Men’s series opener at Suncorp Stadium on May 28.

The Blues snapped that run of dominance with four straight wins from 2016 to 2019. However, Queensland have won four of the past five series from 2020 to 2024, with the Blues last win coming in 2022. Historically the Shield has been contested in a one off game, but two games were played in 2004, 2008 and 2023. The infamous 2023 series that saw the states win one game each, but Queensland win the shield forced a rethink and the first three-match series was introduced in 2024. Last season Queensland lost the series opener 22-12 at Suncorp Stadium, before winning the second 11-10 at McDonald Jones Stadium and the decider 22-6 at Queensland Country Bank Stadium to retain the shield. Queensland lead the series ledger 20-5, with NSW looking for just their sixth victory and first in a three-match series in 2025.\", 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Origin stars want NRLW season timing change\\nENTITIES: Ali Brigginshaw, Ellie Johnston, Tamika Upton, NRLW, Queensland Maroons, NSW Sky Blues\\nEVENT: Players and coaches are calling for changes to the Women's State of Origin schedule to improve match fitness and competition, as the current timing creates stress and impacts the quality of play.\\nCONTEXT: Scheduling issues and lack of match fitness plague Women's Origin.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-02T16:09:34.237Z'}, {'id': 39529, 'sourceId': 12389, 'url': 'https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a64636560/thunderbolts-credits-scenes-explained/', 'title': 'The Thunderbolts Credits Scenes Tease Exactly Where the MCU Is Headed', 'publishDate': '2025-05-01T21:00:00.000Z', 'content': 'The following story contains spoilers for Thunderbolts*. FANS OF THE Marvel Cinematic Universe have been trained well. When you go to see most movies at your favorite local theater, the moment the movie ends and the credits begin to roll, you\\'ll look around and see people starting to get up out of their seats. At a Marvel movie, this is never the case. Ever since the loyal few who stayed until the last names rolled through the screen at the end of 2008\\'s Iron Man were rewarded with the very first appearance of Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and a tease of the Avengers, MCU fans know that the end of the movie is probably where they\\'re going to get something at the very least fun, and, possibly, quite juicy. Recently, though, this hasn\\'t been the case. While the credits scene has continued to be a Marvel mainstay, the things they\\'ve teased have frequently led nowhere. Thor: Love and Thunder, for example, introduced Ted Lasso star Brett Goldstein as Hercules. Did that go anywhere? No. Will it ever? Uh, we\\'ll see (but probably not). Perhaps even worse was the credits scene included with Captain America: Brave New World, which featured The Leader (Tim Blake Nelson) making a vague reference toward \"others\" coming. Cool, the 100th reference to, presumably, some kind of multiverse situation—something everyone following these movies has been familiar with for years and years and offering nothing particularly new or exciting. Luckily, Thunderbolts* is something of an MCU rut-buster. The movie is in contention for the franchise\\'s best movie since Avengers: Endgame, and rights many of the things that seemed to be trending in the wrong direction with some of Marvel\\'s more recent big-screen offerings. Thunderbolts* is shot in actual locations (making minimal use of green screen and The Volume technology), features characters with actual depth and personality played by really charismatic actors, and tells a story that doesn\\'t ever lose itself in too much lore or too many references. It\\'s just a good old fashioned strong movie, one that feels like the ship getting rightened, and one that also—like the old days of the MCU—serves to strongly set up some things that we know are actually coming, and coming soon. Let\\'s first recap how the movie actually ends. Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (a fantastic Julia Louis-Dreyfus) is, well, let\\'s just say an evil, conniving version of Nick Fury. She\\'s sent many of her own anti-hero agents (Florence Pugh\\'s Yelena, Wyatt Russell\\'s John Walker, and Hannah John-Kamen\\'s Ghost) to kill each other, only for them to meet Bob (Lewis Pullman) who turned out to be the lone successful result of something called \"The Sentry Project,\" turning a regular dude into one of the most powerful beings in the world. Eventually, those anti-heroes and Bob (along with David Harbour\\'s Red Guardian and Sebastian Stan\\'s Bucky Barnes) joined forces, creating a team that against all odds (and against Val\\'s plans) joined together, worked together well, and actually cared about each other. In fact, they even overcame a fault in Val\\'s plan—when Sentry (Bob\\'s superhero identity) gave in to his own darkness and depression, becoming The Void and potentially dooming the world. But the Thunderbolts* (named after Yelena\\'s crappy softball team from her youth) make it out alive... just in time to see Val. And they want to make her pay, whether it\\'s killing her on the spot or bringing her straight to prison. But Val, having seen how these people worked together and how the public reacted to their heroics, had another, faster plan. She introduces them, without their knowledge, at an impromtu press conference. Ladies and gentlemen, meet the New Avengers. Everyone is shocked, and no one more than these supposed New Avengers themselves (Red Guardian, who\\'s been searching for his hero moment, seems pretty psyched). But this, of course, is just the beginning. Well, until the credits scenes, at least. Does Thunderbolts have a credits scene?Yes! As usual with the films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Thunderbolts* has not one but two credits scenes. While the first one is primarily just a fun moment for Red Guardian, the second is pretty substantial for the characters, where their story is headed, and the future of the MCU. Credits scene 1: The New Avengers have arrived—and on Wheaties boxes tooMarvel StudiosThe first credits scene in Thunderbolts is just a fun time after the surprising end to the film. The imagery during the credits shows what the New Avengers get up to in the time after Val\\'s announcement—featuring all sorts of headlines and news—and its clear that they\\'re becoming quite famous. The camera then settles on a grocery story aisle, and Red Guardian (David Harbour, now with a nicely-groomed mustache instead of his unruly beard) is trying to draw someone\\'s attention to him (specifically) and the team on a Wheaties box as she looks to pick out the right cereal. Not super successful! But fun nonetheless. Look, we\\'re happy for our guy Alexi—he deserved his moment in the sun. Credits scene 2: An incoming spacecraft (The Fantastic Four have arrived in the Pogo Plane!)Marvel ComicsThe second scene is much more substantial as far as the content of the MCU. We meet up with the New Avengers hanging out in the Avengers Tower (now owned by Val), rocking their uniforms, and lamenting on something that should be pretty essential: The public doesn\\'t respect them as the real Avengers, despite being officially state-sanctioned as such. Captain America Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) doesn\\'t appear in the scene, but we hear second-hand that he\\'s not happy with this development, that he wants to set up his own team, and that he\\'s filed for his own copyright of the team\\'s name. We also learn that he and Bucky aren\\'t seeing eye to eye on any of this. Bob, meanwhile, is kind of just chilling. He\\'s not dangerous, since he\\'s put \"the other guy\" to bed for now; The relationship between Sentry and The Void seems to be very similar to the relationship between Hulk and Banner. Except that Banner is a brilliant scientist and Bob is kind of just some dude. But it\\'s OK because he\\'s cool. Anyway. The New Avengers are monitoring threats and kind of just passing the time, being figureheads, things like that. But they get word of an unidentified, inter-dimensional object entering the Earth\\'s atmosphere... and, folks, it\\'s revealed to be the Fantastic Four\\'s Pogo Plane. This is the famed superhero team\\'s favorite mode of travel for long-distance ventures (as opposed to the Fantasticar, which they use for more every day situations). We know, then, that somehow these things will come together. It\\'s one hell of a cliffhanger. Finally! Obviously, the New Avengers have no idea what this is or what it means—but we do. The Fantastic Four: First Steps is the next MCU movie to be released (coming in July), and we know this will tie into both that film and next year\\'s major event Avengers: Doomsday. It\\'s a wonderful throwback to the way of doing things in the early days of the MCU: The credits scene of Iron Man 2 teased Mjolnir, Thor\\'s hammer, and the next movie to be released was Thor. We know what\\'s coming, and here\\'s something to get us excited about it. And, reader, it worked. We are excited.

      "Sending converted contents format: [{'role': 'user', 'parts': [{'text': 'You are an expert news analyst AI tasked with refining a set of automatically generated news clusters. You will receive a list of clusters, each identified by an ID, a title, and a list of associated article titles.\\n\\nYour primary goal is to identify clusters that should be **merged** because they represent different facets or developments of the *same core story or event*, rather than distinct narratives. Use the following rule of thumb: **\"If analyzing the articles in Cluster A would feel incomplete or artificially separated from the articles in Cluster B because they fundamentally describe the same specific event, ongoing situation, or central topic, they should be merged.\"**\\n\\nDistinguish this from clusters that are merely *related* thematically but cover different specific events, angles, or sub-topics that *can* stand alone as separate stories, even if they might be linked later in analysis. For example:\\n\\n*   **Merge Candidate Example:** Cluster 1 covers the initial report of a factory fire. Cluster 2 covers the emergency response and evacuation related to *that same fire*. Cluster 3 covers the investigation into the cause of *that same fire*. These are facets of the *same core story* (the factory fire event) and should likely be merged.\\n*   **Keep Separate Example:** Cluster 1 covers a new trade agreement signed between Country X and Country Y. Cluster 2 covers protests *within* Country X about the economic impact of *that trade agreement*. While related, the signing event and the domestic protest are distinct stories/angles that could be analyzed separately. Cluster 3 covers a *different* trade dispute Country X has with Country Z – clearly a separate story.\\n\\nYour secondary goal is to identify clusters that should be **filtered out** before further processing. **Filtering should be used sparingly**, primarily to remove noise and maintain data quality, not to judge the importance of a story. The aim is to retain a record of all distinct, coherent events, even routine or smaller ones. Filter *only* if a cluster meets one of these specific criteria:\\n*   **Very Low Article Count:** Contains **fewer than 3 articles**, indicating it likely doesn\\'t represent a sufficiently developed or distinct event captured in the data.\\n*   **Incoherent or Noise:** The articles within the cluster do not form a coherent topic, or the cluster appears to be noise/junk data.\\n*   **Strict Duplicate:** The cluster covers the *exact same specific event* as another cluster, often with significant overlap in articles, making it redundant. (Do not filter merely *related* clusters).\\n*   **Clearly Irrelevant:** The content is demonstrably not related to news events (e.g., advertisements, site navigation links clustered together).\\n\\n**Input Format:**\\n\\nThe input will be structured text as follows:\\n\\n```\\n# ID: [Cluster ID 1] - [Cluster Title 1]\\n  - [Article Title 1a]\\n  - [Article Title 1b]\\n  ...\\n\\n# ID: [Cluster ID 2] - [Cluster Title 2]\\n  - [Article Title 2a]\\n  - [Article Title 2b]\\n  ...\\n\\n[... more clusters ...]\\n```\\n*(Note: Cluster IDs in the input might be strings or numbers, please preserve them as strings in the JSON output).*\\n\\n**Output Requirements:**\\n\\nYour output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON object containing two keys: `merges` and `filters`.\\n\\n1.  **`merges`**: An array of objects.

    "You are an expert news analyst AI tasked with refining a set of automatically generated news clusters. You will receive a list of clusters, each identified by an ID, a title, and a list of associated article titles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your primary goal is to identify clusters that should be **merged** because they represent different facets or developments of the *same core story or event*, rather than distinct narratives. Use the following rule of thumb: **\"If analyzing the articles in Cluster A would feel incomplete or artificially separated from the articles in Cluster B because they fundamentally describe the same specific event, ongoing situation, or central topic, they should be merged.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "Distinguish this from clusters that are merely *related* thematically but cover different specific events, angles, or sub-topics that *can* stand alone as separate stories, even if they might be linked later in analysis. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Merge Candidate Example:** Cluster 1 covers the initial report of a factory fire. Cluster 2 covers the emergency response and evacuation related to *that same fire*. Cluster 3 covers the investigation into the cause of *that same fire*. These are facets of the *same core story* (the factory fire event) and should likely be merged.\n",
    "*   **Keep Separate Example:** Cluster 1 covers a new trade agreement signed between Country X and Country Y. Cluster 2 covers protests *within* Country X about the economic impact of *that trade agreement*. While related, the signing event and the domestic protest are distinct stories/angles that could be analyzed separately. Cluster 3 covers a *different* trade dispute Country X has with Country Z – clearly a separate story.\n",

    "Your secondary goal is to identify clusters that should be **filtered out** before further processing. **Filtering should be used sparingly**, primarily to remove noise and maintain data quality, not to judge the importance of a story. The aim is to retain a record of all distinct, coherent events, even routine or smaller ones. Filter *only* if a cluster meets one of these specific criteria:\n",
    "*   **Very Low Article Count:** Contains **fewer than 3 articles**, indicating it likely doesn't represent a sufficiently developed or distinct event captured in the data.\n",
    "*   **Incoherent or Noise:** The articles within the cluster do not form a coherent topic, or the cluster appears to be noise/junk data.\n",
    "*   **Strict Duplicate:** The cluster covers the *exact same specific event* as another cluster, often with significant overlap in articles, making it redundant. (Do not filter merely *related* clusters).\n",

It’s a big asset that they have.”Reacting to the US-Ukraine deal, foreign secretary David Lammy said: “The UK welcomes steps taken by the US and Ukraine to sign an economic partnership.“The UK’s support for Ukraine remains steadfast.

The New York Times indicated that the concept of security guarantees was dismissed by the US “early in the process.”In an X post on Thursday, Rubio thanked US President’s Donald Trump leadership, under which the deal was signed. Rubio called it “a milestone in our shared prosperity and an important step in ending this war.”Thanks to @POTUS\\'s leadership, today the U.S. and Ukraine signed the Reconstruction Investment Fund Agreement—a milestone in our shared prosperity and an important step in ending this war.— Secretary Marco Rubio (@SecRubio) May 1, 2025Negotiations for the agreement stretched on for several months, although both parties intended to finalize it during Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky’s visit to the White House in late February. The televised meeting led to a tense confrontation during which Trump accused the Ukrainian leader of ingratitude and “gambling with World War III.”\\nThis comes as Washington is in talks with Moscow over a possible peace deal that would end the Ukraine conflict. Multiple media sources indicate that the agreement put forward by Washington entails the US recognizing Russia’s sovereignty over Crimea. Additionally, the proposal reportedly includes a “freezing” of the conflict along the existing front line and an acknowledgment of Moscow’s control over significant portions of four former Ukrainian regions that voted to join Russia.Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a halt to all military operations against Ukrainian forces from midnight on May 7 until midnight on May 10, stating that this is being done for “humanitarian reasons.” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov pointed out that Russia considers the ceasefire “the start of direct negotiations with Kiev without preconditions.”Zelensky branded Moscow’s three-day truce declaration a “manipulation attempt,” saying he wanted an immediate 30-day ceasefire instead. According to Lavrov, “a [30-day] ceasefire in this situation is considered a precondition that will be used to further support the Kiev regime and strengthen its military capabilities.”\\n```\\n\\n## [US-Ukraine minerals deal ‘benefits both countries’ – State Department](https://www.rt.com/news/616597-us-ukraine-deal-benefits/) (#40991)\\n\\n> 2025-05-01 07:09:18+00:00\\n\\n```\\nSpokeswoman Tammy Bruce has said the deal is “perfect” because it was crafted by President Donald Trump\\nThe minerals deal granting the US access to Ukraine’s natural resources benefits both nations, State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said on Thursday. Speaking to Fox Business, she described the agreement as “perfect” because it was crafted by President Donald Trump, citing his business experience.Washington and Kiev signed the long-anticipated agreement on Wednesday. While the full text has not been made public, the available details suggest that it allocates part of the revenues from resource development to a joint US-Ukraine investment fund, while Kiev retains full ownership of the actual resources. Kiev hopes the deal will secure continued military and financial support from Washington, while the US gains access to Ukraine’s vast mineral wealth, particularly rare-earth elements critical for high-tech industries.“A lot of people have wanted this to happen. It benefits both countries immensely… and it’s not a surprise because it’s President Donald Trump, it is the perfect deal,” Bruce said. She did not provide further details on the agreement but described it as “an investment in Ukraine.”\\n“This is about a long-term durable dynamic regarding an economic partnership with that nation, which is necessary in general,” she said. Bruce added that a US presence in Ukraine would also enhance the country’s security.“When America is your friend and America is your partner, your nation is going to be better off, your citizens are going to be better off, and there is a security component just in our presence,” she stated.Bruce stressed that the deal is “separate” from the ongoing conflict and US-Russia peace negotiations, but said work on the talks is progressing, with Moscow and Kiev expected to submit proposals “in a few days.”Negotiations on the minerals deal have been underway since the early days of Trump’s return to office, running parallel to broader peace efforts. The Trump administration has insisted that the deal\\xa0should compensate the US for previous aid to Ukraine, despite Kiev’s claims that the assistance was given unconditionally.\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

Critics described it as an ideological statement.The report relied on scientific evidence reviews of such treatments as hormone therapy and puberty blockers that were published when these treatments were first made available to transgender adolescents.Credit...Carolyn Kaster/Associated PressMay 1, 2025Federal health officials published a report on Thursday declaring that the use of hormonal and surgical treatments in young people with gender dysphoria lacked scientific evidence and expressing concern about long-term harms, a stark reversal from previous agency recommendations and the advice of top U.S. medical groups.The report instead prioritized the role of psychotherapy, a divisive intervention to treat gender dysphoria that many advocates and physicians have equated with so-called conversion therapy.Other parts of the review seemed to call into question the very notion that some people have a gender identity that does not align with their sex at birth.In January, President Trump signed an executive order titled “Protecting Children From Chemical and Surgical Mutilation” giving the Department of Health and Human Services 90 days to produce a report on the best practices for treating young people who say their gender does not align with their birth sex.But the order made it clear that the administration had already reached its own conclusion about gender transition treatments for minors, characterizing the “blatant harm done to children” as a “stain on our nation’s history.”The 400-page report took a more sober tone but reached a similar conclusion. In a remarkable departure from the standard for medical evidence reviews, the authors were not identified pending a post-publication review process that would begin in “the coming days.”Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

This is due in part to the mischaracterization of such approaches as ‘conversion therapy,’ the report said. “Psychotherapy is a noninvasive alternative to endocrine and surgical interventions for the treatment of pediatric gender dysphoria.”Though the report argues that this “exploratory therapy” is not the same as the long practice of “conversion therapy”—which is a practice of attempting to change someone’s sexual orientation or gender identity—advocates see little difference.“This report not only rejects health care best practices for transgender people, it goes a step further by recommending conversion therapy, though under a new, rebranded name, ‘exploratory therapy,’” said Casey Pick, director of law and policy at the LGBTQ+ advocacy group the Trevor Project, in an emailed statement. “Despite the report’s claims, this is, in fact, the same harmful practice of conversion therapy, just using friendlier language. We urge this Administration to respect and support people for who they are—and to let families and doctors make decisions based on what keeps people healthy, not government ideology.”Read More: Is Conversion Therapy the New Frontier for Anti-LGBTQ+ Groups?\\xa0The report arrives following a Trump Executive Order, titled “Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,” which threatens to cut federal funding to hospitals and medical providers that provide gender-affirming-care to people ages 19 or younger. The Executive Order directed HHS to release a report on the existing literature for treatment for children with gender dysphoria in 90 days, which fell on April 28.The language used in the report expresses a shift in policy and in sentiments regarding gender-affirming care—referring to the practice only as “Pediatric Medical Transition” and referring to “gender confirmation surgery” as “sex reassignment surgery.” This shift is in line with language brought about by Trump’s Jan. 20 Executive Order which proclaimed that there are only two sexes and that gender identity is “disconnected from biological reality,” calling for an erasure of the term.Read More: The Implications of Trump’s Executive Order on SexA federal judge issued a preliminary injunction against the order—and though the order hasn’t fully been enforced, some federal offices, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, issued notices stating that they will change their practices to comply with Trump\\'s restrictions on gender-affirming-care.Conversion therapy aims to alter someone’s sexual orientation or gender identity. It has been proven to be ineffective and harmful to LGBTQ+ people, and it can include a wide variety of practices.\"Endorsing this kind of therapy is devastating,” says Shannon Minter, vice president of legal of the National Center for Lesbian Rights. “Being gay, being transgender is not a choice. No amount of talking or persuasion or any kind of counseling can change that.”Gender-affirming-care is supported by the major medical associations in the U.S., including the American Academy of Pediatrics and American Medical Association. Meanwhile, conversion therapy has been discredited by numerous medical associations.As the Trump Administration ushers in an era of anti-trans policy at the federal level, Supreme Court cases could also dictate LGBTQ+ rights. In March, the nation’s highest court announced it would be hearing oral arguments for Chiles v. Salazar, which challenges Colorado’s conversion therapy ban under the premise that it infringes on free speech. A decision for U.S. v. Skrmetti—expected in June—will decide whether gender-affirming-care bans for minors are unconstitutional.“Those cases just raise the stakes of the issue even higher and create really maximum danger for transgender young people,” says Minter. “Worst-case scenario would be for the Supreme Court to uphold state laws banning essential medical care for these young people, and then turn around and strike down state laws protecting LGBTQ+ youth from conversion therapy. That would be a devastating double blow.”A 2022 report estimated that there were some 300,000 transgender youth ages 13 to 17 in the U.S., according to UCLA School of Law’s Williams Institute.Trump’s Executive Order on gender-affirming-care also called for investigations into this type of health care in sanctuary states, stating that medical professionals were “maiming… impressionable children.” Trump also declared April as “National Child Abuse Prevention Month,” and in his proclamation stated that he is “taking action to cut off all taxpayer funding to any institution that engages in the sexual mutilation of our youth.”More than 500 anti-LGBTQ+ bills were introduced on the state level for the 2025 legislative session, per the ACLU’s legislative tracker. In Kentucky, legislators voted to overturn their existing conversion therapy ban, legalizing the practice in the state. Attacks on gender-affirming-care have been much more rampant in recent years, as 26 states have passed laws limiting access to such care for trans and nonbinary people, according to the Human Rights Campaign.“This isn\\'t about us as doctors. This is about our patients and ensuring that they continue to get the science-based, evidence-based, standard-of-care medicine that really keeps them whole and healthy,” says Dr. Morissa Ladinsky, an academic general pediatrician at Stanford Medicine who treats children with gender dysphoria. Ladinsky was named as a plaintiff in Ladinsky v. Ivey, a 2022 lawsuit against an Alabama law that criminalizes parents for allowing their children to access gender-affirming-care. (The case was later taken down and another lawsuit against the Alabama law was filed.)Experts and advocacy organizations warn of the detrimental effects of conversion therapy. A peer-reviewed study conducted by the Trevor Project in 2020 found that young LGBTQ+ people who underwent conversion therapy were more than twice as likely to report attempting suicide compared to those who did not.Nearly half of all U.S. states ban the controversial practice, though attempts to ban it at the federal level have never proven fruitful. A 2023 Trevor Project report found that conversion therapy still happens across the country. Two years ago, there were at least 1,300 practitioners believed to be still offering the practice in the U.S.\\n```\\n\\n## [iPhones sold in US will no longer come from China - as Apple reveals impact of Trump\\'s tariffs](https://news.sky.com/story/iphones-sold-in-us-will-no-longer-come-from-china-as-apple-reveals-impact-of-trumps-tariffs-13359607) (#39701)\\n\\n> 2025-05-02 01:37:00+00:00\\n\\n```\\nApple says devices sold in the US will no longer come from China, as the tech giant tries to mitigate the impact of Donald Trump\\'s tariffs.Most iPhones will be sourced from India instead, with iPads coming from Vietnam, to prevent dramatic price rises for American consumers.\\nUnveiling financial results from January to March, the company said the US president\\'s escalating trade war has had a limited impact on its performance so far.However, Apple CEO Tim Cook believes the tariffs will add £677m in costs during the current quarter - assuming Trump\\'s policies don\\'t change.\\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\\nHow Trump 2.0 changed the world\\nRevenue for the first three months of the year stood at £71.8bn, with earnings of £18.6bn also beating analyst expectations.\\nHigh demand for iPhones during this period may have been driven by US shoppers rushing to make purchases before the new tariffs came into force.But the full impact of any panic buying will only emerge when Apple reports its results from April to June later in the year.\\nMore on Apple\\nApple and Meta fined millions by EU over competition law\\n\\'Cloak of secrecy\\' over Apple and Home Office showdown must be removed, US politicians tell tribunal\\nApple vs Home Office encryption court battle must be held in public, say MPs\\nApple\\'s reliance on Chinese factories to manufacture its iPhones meant the company was far more exposed to the impact of Trump\\'s trade war than others.Read more from Sky News:NHS may offer weight loss jabs over counterTrump\\'s national security adviser to leave roleNorth Korean hacker caught red-handed\\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\\nTrump: Tariffs making US \\'rich\\'\\nAfter the president unveiled plans to impose reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries - now largely paused for 90 days - Apple\\'s stock plunged by 23%, wiping out £582bn of value.While its share price has recovered slightly, it remains 5% lower than before \"Liberation Day\".Growing tensions between Washington and Beijing are also having an impact on Apple\\'s sales in China, which fell 2.3% between January and March.\\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\\nIs your iPhone data less secure?\\nAddressing the planned changes to manufacturing, Mr Cook added: \"We have a complex supply chain.

Allies and enemies alike are beginning to adapt.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York Times100 Days of Solitude: Trump and the Retreat of AmericaPresident Trump’s approach to foreign policy in his second term has been transactional, unpredictable and exploitative. Allies and enemies alike are beginning to adapt.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesMay 1, 2025It was well after 2 a.m., but an aide to Vice President JD Vance was trying to roust a senior Ukrainian official out of his bed in a Munich hotel. He wanted a face-to-face meeting to close a deal letting the United States extract valuable minerals in Ukraine, a priority of the new president, Donald J. Trump.It had to be done that night, the aide said, before Mr. Vance was scheduled to meet the next day with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine at a trans-Atlantic security conference. The Ukrainian protested that it was late and refused to leave his room, according to a foreign policy adviser briefed on the incident. The meeting the next day went ahead, though the proposal remained unsigned.The minerals deal, which was finally signed on Wednesday, and the pre-dawn attempt to push it through in February, are a telling symbol of American statecraft in the second Trump administration. Exploitative, transactional, almost imperial in its demands, the deal encapsulates Mr. Trump’s approach to the world in his first 100 days, a chaotic period unlike any in the post-World War II era.From the NATO alliance to the global trading system, Mr. Trump has swung a giant wrecking ball through the existing world order.ImageNew cars at an import and export zone in Guangzhou, China, last month. China has responded to Mr. Trump’s triple-digit levies in kind — confident that in many industries, it so completely dominates the supply chain that rivals would find it hard to make comparable goods elsewhere.Credit...Qilai Shen for The New York TimesImageU.S. marines participating in a NATO Arctic training exercise in northern Norway in March. European officials worry that tens of thousands of American troops may be pulled out of Europe over the next few months or years.Credit...Davide Monteleone for The New York TimesHe has seemed, at times, heedless of the cost to the domestic and global economy, to trust in the United States or to the value of its most credit-worthy holdings. The dollar swooned and the yield on Treasury bonds spiked as investors fled American assets.Mr. Trump has bluntly challenged the core principle of national sovereignty, hectoring Canada to become the 51st American state and threatening Greenland with an American military occupation. His across-the-board tariffs have halted a decades-long march toward free trade and open markets, driving up prices, paralyzing investors, chilling consumers and triggering a dangerous trade war with China.“We will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of any longer,” the president declared in his inaugural address in January. “During every day of the Trump administration, I will, very simply, put America first.”In his headlong rush to replace Pax Americana with America First, Mr. Trump has left the world fumbling to adjust to a new landscape, the contours of which are still in flux. To many foreign leaders, who grew up in a world cushioned by the postwar alliances and multilateral institutions created by the United States, the president’s approach has landed with the unsettling thud of a predawn visit at the door.“For America’s friends and allies, this is traumatic,” said Malcolm Turnbull, who was prime minister of Australia during Mr. Trump’s first term. “It’s like discovering your spouse has betrayed you and has a secret life. Suddenly you discover that the U.S. has a thoroughly different agenda.”Mr. Turnbull had his own run-in with Mr. Trump in 2017 over the handling of refugees. But this time, he said, is different. Untrammeled by advisers who curbed his most extreme impulses in the first term, Mr. Trump has moved with dizzying speed across multiple fronts. He is trading allies for adversaries in Europe, floating a far-fetched proposal to rebuild war-torn Gaza, and sending immigrants — in at least one case, accidentally — to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, beyond the reach of American courts.ImageRelatives of Arturo Suárez protesting his deportation to El Salvador in Caracas, Venezuela in March.

Recognizing that Mr. Trump’s policies may no longer be simply the passing fancies of an aberrational leader, countries are making new commitments and seeking new alliances — in some cases, new leaders — the better to cope with an erratic, unreliable and inward-looking America.A few are standing their ground, whether it is the patriotic resistance of Canadians and Greenlanders or China’s tit-for-tat response to Mr. Trump’s tariffs. Even Mr. Zelensky’s foot-dragging on the minerals deal resulted in an agreement that provides Ukraine with a degree of American engagement in return for America’s access to proceeds from Ukraine’s reserves of rare earth minerals.The late-night request by Mr. Vance’s aide for a face-to-face meeting in Munich, officials familiar with the episode said, was part of a lengthy exchange of texts and calls over the deal between him and Ukrainian officials.There are signs that firmness has an effect: In Canada, Prime Minister Mark Carney won an election victory this week with a stand-up-to-Trump message. Mr. Trump has adjusted his tariffs against China to exempt key products, while he and Mr. Zelensky held, by all accounts, a good meeting before Pope Francis’ funeral at the Vatican, two months after their spectacular bust-up in the Oval Office.“We don’t know whether the shock-and-awe approach is going to be a permanent fixture of American foreign policy or a more fleeting phenomenon,” said Wolfgang Ischinger, who served as Germany’s ambassador to the United States from 2001 to 2006. “So, we’re trying to hedge against the consequences of what has already happened and hedge against possible future developments.”In Germany, that has opened the door to a landmark spending package of 500 billion euros ($568 billion) on defense and public-works projects. It was prodded, Mr. Ischinger said, by the “electric shock of Donald Trump” and his abrupt pivot from Europe to Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin.It has been a harrowing 100 days, forcing America’s partners through a process not unlike the stages of grief popularized by the psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross. Denial, anger, bargaining, depression and ultimately, a measure of acceptance — all these emotions, and more, are rippling through a world remade by Mr. Trump.Day 25, Munich: From Allies to AdversariesFew have embraced the role of the president’s enforcer abroad more enthusiastically than his vice president. Arriving on Valentine’s Day at the Munich Security Conference, Mr. Vance was armed with a quiver of arrows.Yet while waiting to give his speech in a kitchen next to the stage at the Hotel Bayerische Hof, he bantered easily with a handful of organizers and other officials, recalling his previous appearance at the meeting, as a senator in 2024, which he said had raised his stature and might even have helped him get picked by Mr. Trump as his running mate.“We all laughed and joked, and then he was like, ‘I might scare you a little,’” said one of the hosts, recalling the lighthearted exchange amid a clatter of pots and pans.Mr. Vance’s 18-minute speech did more than that. It all but shredded eight decades of trans-Atlantic ties. His big fear for Europe, he said, was not Russia or China, but the “threat from within — the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America.”Europe, he claimed, is a place where elite bureaucrats muzzle freedom of speech, cancel elections they don’t want and sideline parties they don’t agree with. European leaders were afraid of their own voters, he told the stunned audience, before delivering a thinly veiled endorsement of Germany’s far-right party, Alternative for Germany, or AfD, a week before a parliamentary election there.ImageVice President JD Vance at the Munich Security Conference in February.

The Cold War paradigm, in which the United States throws a security umbrella over its allies in Europe and Asia, is giving way to a much narrower view of American security, said Stephen K. Bannon, former chief strategist for Mr. Trump. It is built on securing America’s own hemisphere, while leaving the security of Europe and Asia to the Europeans and Asians.Mr. Bannon acknowledged the risks to this retrenchment, most obviously in East Asia, where China, having witnessed Mr. Trump’s tolerance of a revanchist Russia, might be emboldened to move on Taiwan, which it has long claimed as its own. He argued that Mr. Trump’s tariffs, which he described as “economic war,” would be a check on the territorial ambitions of China’s president, Xi Jinping.“What Trump is doing is rethinking the geostrategic order,” Mr. Bannon said. “It’s almost like the Congress of Vienna,” he said, referring to the early 19th-century diplomatic meetings that set the borders of a post-Napoleonic Europe.This, he said, also explains Mr. Trump’s designs on the Panama Canal, Canada and Greenland. No longer merely neighbors, they are ramparts in a hemispheric fortress. For some in Greenland, a remote Arctic expanse that Mr. Trump first suggested buying from Denmark in 2019, the interest was initially flattering.“I thought, ‘What a fascinating time to be living in Greenland,’” said Jorgen Qimussersuaq Kristensen, one of its most celebrated dog-sledding champions. “Suddenly, the world opened up to us.”But as Mr. Trump’s overtures grew more insistent — in January, he refused to rule out using military force to take the island — Greenlanders bridled. A planned visit in March by Mr. Vance’s wife, Usha, did not help. Originally, she was to attend the “Great Race of the North,” a dog-sled competition won by Mr. Kristensen five times.ImageThe locks at the Panama Canal’s Miraflores Visitor Center.

The vice president chided Denmark for its shabby treatment of Greenlanders, saying that only the United States would protect them.“That way of speaking — saying ‘We take Greenland’ — it’s not good,” Mr. Kristensen said. “More Greenlanders don’t like them now.”Day 39, the Oval Office: Learning to Live With TrumpWhen Mr. Zelensky sat down with Mr. Trump in the Vatican last Saturday, their utilitarian cushioned metal chairs were a jarring contrast to the Renaissance splendor of St. Peter’s Basilica. The two men seemed to take little notice, leaning into each other, as if sharing a confidence. The White House described the brief meeting as “very productive.” Mr. Zelensky said it might prove historic.Whether a 15-minute huddle will salvage America’s support for Ukraine is, of course, too soon to say. But it may provide a lesson to leaders in how to deal with Mr. Trump. Since their bitter encounter on Feb. 28, when the president told Mr. Zelensky, “you don’t have the cards” against Russia, Mr. Trump has been nudged to the point where he now accuses Mr. Putin of stringing him along in cease-fire negotiations.The fence-mending began immediately after a grim-faced Mr. Zelensky left the White House that February evening. The next day, Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain soothed his bruised feelings over dinner at 10 Downing Street. He and President Emmanuel Macron of France then coached him on how to make amends. Both had paid calls on Mr. Trump that had gone well, not least because they were more solicitous.ImageMr. Trump berating Mr. Zelensky at a notorious meeting in the Oval Office of the White House in February.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesImageMr. Zelensky met with Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain and President Emmanuel Macron of France in London two days later, where the two leaders expressed their support for the Ukrainian president.Credit...Pool photo by WpaMr. Starmer dispatched his national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, to work with Mr. Zelensky on a response that would satisfy Mr. Trump. Mr. Zelensky initially recoiled at using the word “cease-fire,” worried that it would trap Ukraine in a truce that the Russians would breach. Mr. Powell crafted language that referred to ending the fighting “in a lasting way.”Mr. Starmer phoned Mr. Trump to see if he could live with that, according to officials briefed on the deliberations. He said he could. Mr. Zelensky expressed regret over the Oval Office meeting, though he never formally apologized.In some cases, foreign leaders have found, simply waiting out Mr. Trump is the best option. In early February, the president floated a pie-in-the-sky plan to relocate more than two million Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring Jordan and Egypt. The ruined enclave, Mr. Trump said, could then be taken over by the United States and transformed into the “Riviera of the Middle East.”For Jordan’s King Abdullah II, who already hosts 2.4 million Palestinian refugees in his country, it was deeply aggravating, according to an Arab diplomat who was briefed on his reaction. Jordanian officials believe the idea originated with right-wing Israeli officials, some of whom have spoken openly of clearing Gaza of its Palestinian residents.Rather than become angry, Abdullah kept his cool, the diplomat said. At a meeting in the Oval Office a week later, Mr. Trump asked the king why he could not take more refugees. Abdullah replied that Jordan already had far more refugees, per capita, than the United States. It was a well-worn Jordanian talking point, but it nevertheless appeared to placate Mr. Trump. He has said little about the plan since then.Day 79, Guangzhou: China Doesn’t BlinkIf there is a unified theory behind Mr. Trump’s global disruption, it is the superpower rivalry with China, which he accuses of “ripping off” the United States through an unbalanced trade relationship. Yet the tariffs, an article of faith for Mr. Trump going back to the 1980s, have done little to intimidate the Chinese.When the noon hour struck on April 9 in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, and tariffs on Chinese exports soared in the United States, Elon Li barely took notice. Standing near the front of his busy factory, which turns out ovens and cooking equipment for restaurants, Mr. Li kept talking, even as his workers halted their screeching machines for lunch. He said his priority was on getting safety certifications so that he could start shipping through Amazon to the United States later this spring.The tariffs do not faze him. China’s manufacturing costs are so much lower than anywhere else in the world, Mr. Li said, that it would always be competitive. “I think it is OK, because there are not many choices,” he said.That pragmatic optimism has persisted in China in the face of Mr. Trump’s tariffs, and it has fueled perhaps the most forceful pushback by any country. China has responded to Mr. Trump’s triple-digit levies in kind — confident that in many industries, it so completely dominates the supply chain that rivals would find it hard to make comparable goods anywhere else.ImageA restaurant appliance and cookware factory in Guangzhou, China, last month.Credit...Qilai Shen for The New York TimesImageMr. Trump announcing reciprocal tariffs in the Rose Garden of the White House last month.Credit...Haiyun Jiang for The New York TimesChina’s real weapon may lie in the red-clay hills where it mines heavy rare-earth elements. In early April, it temporarily halted exports of rare-earth metals, which are turned into magnets, a crucial component in electric motors. China is creating a new export license system that could hinder the ability of American military contractors to obtain these supplies over the long term.China’s refusal to blink appears to be working. Mr. Trump recently handed out exemptions for consumer electronics, like laptop computers and smartphones. His Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said a trade war with China was not sustainable.Japan and South Korea, with smaller economies than China, are relying less on muscle than on their ties to the United States, which is, after all, still nominally an ally.Japan’s prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, sent an old friend who had studied in the United States, Ryosei Akazawa, to meet with Mr. Trump’s aides. He wound up getting a meeting with the president, who complained that “there are no American cars on your roads,” but gifted him a red MAGA baseball cap. South Korea’s acting president, Han Duck-soo, made clear in a CNN interview just before he spoke to Mr. Trump by phone, that his country would not join with China, as had been rumored, to counter the tariffs.Whether those gestures will work is anybody’s guess. Both countries are eager to strike trade deals, but the line of hopefuls in Washington is long. And Mr. Trump made his negotiating strategy clear in an Easter post on his Truth Social platform that could serve as a summary of the Trump doctrine.“The golden rule of negotiating and success,” Mr. Trump wrote. “He who has the gold makes the rules.”ImageThe White House at sunset on April 23.Credit...Haiyun Jiang for The New York TimesReporting was contributed by Katrin Bennhold and Steven Erlanger in Munich, Jeffrey Gettleman in Nuuk, Greenland, Aaron Boxerman in Jerusalem, Fatima AbdulKarim in Ramallah, West Bank, Keith Bradsher in Guangzhou, China, Martin Fackler in Tokyo, and Choe Sang-Hun in Seoul.Mark Landler is the London bureau chief of The Times, covering the United Kingdom, as well as American foreign policy in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.

The report is also limited to children and does not address treatment for adults.Gender-affirming care for transgender youth under standards widely used in the U.S. includes supportive talk therapy and can — but does not always — involve puberty blockers or hormone treatment. Gender-affirming surgeries for transgender minors are rare.A judge has blocked key parts of Trump’s order, which includes denying research and educational grants for medical schools, hospitals and other institutions that provide gender-affirming care to people 18 or younger. Several hospitals around the country ceased providing care. The White House said Monday that since Trump took office, HHS has eliminated 215 grants totaling $477 million for research or education on gender-affirming treatment.Most Republican-controlled states have also adopted bans or restrictions on gender-affirming care. A U.S. Supreme Court ruling is pending after justices heard arguments in December in a case about whether states can enforce such laws.The Jan. 28 executive order is among several administration policies aimed at denying the existence of transgender people. Trump also has ordered the government to identify people as either male or female rather than accept a concept of gender in which people fall along a spectrum, remove transgender service members from the military, and bar transgender women and girls from sports competitions that align with their gender. This month, HHS issued guidance to protect whistleblowers who report doctors or hospitals providing gender-affirming care. Judges are blocking enforcement of several of the policies.This latest HHS report, which Trump called for while campaigning last year, represents a reversal in federal policy. The U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which is part of HHS, found that no research had determined that behavioral health interventions could change someone’s gender identity or sexual orientation. The 2023 update to the 2015 finding is no longer on the agency’s website. The administration says this new report will go through a peer-review process. In the meantime, it’s not saying who contributed to it, “in order to help maintain the integrity of this process.”The report says that medical groups have relied on medical treatment rather than behavioral therapy for transgender youth partly because of a “mischaracterization of such approaches as ‘conversion therapy,’” which about half the states have banned for minors.The American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry has said that evidence shows conversion therapies inflict harm on young people, including elevated rates of suicidal ideation. And the American Medical Association has urged states not to ban gender-affirming care for minors, saying that “empirical evidence has demonstrated that trans and non-binary gender identities are normal variations of human identity and expression.”\\n```\\n\\n## [Netanyahu\\'s campaign against Iran\\'s nuclear program is muted with Trump in power](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/netanyahus-campaign-irans-nuclear-program-muted-trump-power-121387220) (#41100)\\n\\n> 2025-05-02 05:50:32+00:00\\n\\n```\\nJERUSALEM -- When the U.S. and Iran met for nuclear talks a decade ago, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu railed against an emerging deal from the world’s most public stages, including in a fiery speech to Congress seen as a direct challenge to the Obama administration as it was wrapping up the talks.Now, as the sides sit down to discuss a new deal, Netanyahu has fallen silent.Netanyahu sees an Iran with nuclear weapons as an existential threat to Israel, and he is just as wary of any new U.S. agreement with its archenemy that may not meet his standards. Yet he finds himself shackled with Donald Trump in the White House. Netanyahu is unwilling to publicly criticize a president who has shown broad support for Israel, whom he deems to be Israel\\'s greatest friend, and who doesn\\'t take well to criticism.He “can\\'t do anything that goes against Trump. He\\'s paralyzed,” said Yoel Guzansky, an Iran expert at the Institute for National Security Studies, a Tel Aviv-based think tank. Israel is in a position of power against Iran after a series of strategic achievements over the past 18 months in the wars that have shaken the Middle East. It thrashed Iran’s allies in Lebanon, Gaza and Syria, and directly attacked Iran last year, neutralizing some of its key air defenses. Experts say Israel now has a window of opportunity for what could be an effective strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities, with possibly less regional blowback.Yet Israel’s leader was recently unable to galvanize Trump to prioritize a strike against Iran’s nuclear facilities — which would likely hinge on U.S. military assistance to be successful. With the U.S. negotiating with Iran, Israel has little legitimacy to pursue a military option on its own.“Netanyahu is trapped,” said Eytan Gilboa, an expert on U.S.-Israel relations at Bar-Ilan University near Tel Aviv. “He was banking on Israel’s position relative to Iran to improve under Trump. In practice, it’s the opposite.” Netanyahu and his nationalist supporters hoped Trump’s return to the White House would be advantageous because of his history of support for Israel. They thought that, under Trump, the U.S. might back a strike on Iranian nuclear facilities. But Trump’s approach to Iran — as well as on other issues, such as tariffs — has shown the relationship is more complicated, and that Trump’s interests don’t entirely align with Netanyahu’s.Netanyahu has long accused Iran of developing a nuclear weapon and went on a global campaign against the Obama deal. He painted the nuclear program as an existential threat to Israel and the world, and said the agreement was too weak to contain it. Israel remains the Mideast\\'s only nuclear-armed state, an advantage it would like to keep.With Netanyahu\\'s strong encouragement, Trump backed out of the deal struck by Obama. And since returning to the White House, Trump has given Israel free rein in its war against Hamas in Gaza, been soft on the worsening humanitarian crisis in the territory and launched strikes against the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have attacked Israel since the start of the war.But now that the U.S. has returned to the negotiating table with Iran, Netanyahu would risk jeopardizing his good ties with the president if he were to publicly oppose one of his administration’s key foreign policy initiatives.The last time Netanyahu crossed the temperamental Trump was when he congratulated Joe Biden for his election win in 2020. Trump was apparently offended by the perceived disloyalty, and their ties went into deep freeze.Israel is communicating to Washington its priorities for any deal. As part of that, it understood that should Israel choose to carry out a strike on Iran, it would likely be doing so alone — so long as negotiations were underway, according to an Israeli official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy.In a speech in Jerusalem this week, Netanyahu said he had discussed his terms for a deal with Trump. He explained that it would need to dismantle all the infrastructure of Iran\\'s nuclear program and that it should work to prevent Iran from developing ballistic missiles capable of delivering a bomb.\"I said to President Trump that I hope that this is what the negotiators will do. We’re in close contact with the United States. But I said one way or the other – Iran will not have nuclear weapons,” he said. Netanyahu has said he would favor a strict diplomatic agreement similar to Libya’s deal in 2003 to destroy its nuclear facilities and allow inspectors unfettered access. However, it is not clear if Trump will set such strict conditions — and Iran has rejected giving up its right to enrich. The Trump-led talks with Iran began earlier this month and have advanced to expert discussions over how to rein in Iran\\'s nuclear program and prevent it from being able to obtain atomic weapons, should it choose to pursue them. Iran says its program is for peaceful purposes, though some officials increasingly threaten to pursue the bomb. While Trump has said a military option remains on the table, and has moved military assets to the region, he says he prefers a diplomatic solution. Planned talks between Iran and the United States this weekend were postponed on Thursday.Since Trump scrapped the Obama-era agreement in 2018, Iran has ramped up its nuclear enrichment and increased its uranium stockpile.Netanyahu\\'s 2015 speech to Congress against Obama\\'s deal — at the invitation of Republicans — was made without consulting the White House. Obama did not attend.That was just one of many instances in which Netanyahu was seen as cozying up to Republicans, driving a wedge in what has traditionally been bipartisan support for Israel. That, coupled with Netanyahu\\'s strained relationship with the Biden administration over Israel\\'s conduct in Gaza, has meant that Netanyahu can\\'t rely on Democratic allies to take up his cause. Still, Netanyahu would struggle to find any Republicans willing to publicly confront the president on this issue. And he himself will struggle to criticize a deal if one is clinched; instead, he might send surrogates like his far-right allies to do so, said Gilboa of Bar-Ilan University.But until then, Gilboa said, Netanyahu\\'s best hope is that the talks fail.“That, for him, will be the best case scenario.”\\n```\\n\\n## [Harris accuses Trump of \\'wholesale abandonment\\' of American ideals in major post-election speech](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/kamala-harris-plans-speech-sharply-criticizing-donald-trumps-121310346) (#41127)\\n\\n> 2025-05-01 06:38:16+00:00\\n\\n```\\nSAN FRANCISCO -- SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Former Vice President Kamala Harris used a high-profile speech Wednesday to sharply criticize President Donald Trump amid speculation about whether she will mount another presidential campaign or opt to run for California governor. In her most extensive public remarks since leaving office in January following her defeat to Trump, Harris said she’s inspired by Americans fighting Trump’s agenda despite threats to their freedom or livelihood. “Instead of an administration working to advance America’s highest ideals, we are witnessing the wholesale abandonment of those ideals,” Harris said a day after Trump reached 100 days in office.Before Wednesday, Harris had barely mentioned Trump by name since she conceded defeat to him in November.In a 15-minute speech, she spoke to the anxiety and confusion that have gripped many of her supporters since Trump took office but discouraged despair. “They are counting on the notion that if they can make some people afraid, it will have a chilling effect on others. But what they have overlooked is that fear is not the only thing that’s contagious,” Harris said. “Courage is contagious.”Trump went after Harris in a campaign-style rally Tuesday marking his 100th day in office. He sarcastically called her a “great border czar\" and a “great candidate,\" and repeated some of the applause lines he routinely delivered during the campaign. Until Harris replaced Joe Biden atop the Democratic ticket last summer, Trump said, “I knew nothing about her.\"Harris cautioned Americans against viewing Trump’s administration as merely chaotic, casting it instead as a “high-velocity event,” the culmination of extensive work on the right to remake government.“A vessel is being used for the swift implementation of an agenda that has been decades in the making,\" Harris said. “An agenda to slash public education. An agenda to shrink government and then privatize its services. All while giving tax breaks to the wealthiest among us.”Harris chose a friendly audience for her return to the political arena, addressing the 20th anniversary gala for Emerge America, an organization that recruits and trains Democratic women to run for office. It grew in part from Harris’ run for San Francisco district attorney in the early 2000s.The speech was delivered below luminous chandeliers in a gold-trimmed ballroom in the landmark Palace Hotel.Harris is ramping up her public presence as Democrats nationally search for a path forward after November\\'s election, in which Republicans also won control of Congress. While a slate of high-profile Democrats — from governors to businessmen — seek leadership roles within the party, the former vice president retains unique influence and would reshape any future race she chooses to enter. She praised Democrats who have been especially prolific in criticizing Trump, name-dropping lawmakers diverse in their ideology and style: Sens. Cory Booker, Chris Van Hollen, Chris Murphy and Bernie Sanders along with Reps. Jasmine Crockett, Maxwell Frost and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. But she did not take a stand in one of her party\\'s central divides, neither calling for mass mobilization like Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker or questioning Democratic positioning on key issues like California Gov. Gavin Newsom. “I’m not here tonight to offer all the answers,” Harris said. “But I am here to say this: You are not alone and we are all in this together.”But she warned that things will probably get worse before they get better.“The one check, the one balance, the one power that must not fail is the voice of the people,” she said. Harris, a former state attorney general and U.S. senator from California, has not discouraged speculation that she might enter the race to replace the term-limited Newsom, himself a potential contender for president. And she has not ruled out another run for the White House. She did not address her future Wednesday. She continues to fundraise, using a joint committee that includes Harris for President, the Democratic National Committee and state Democratic parties. The committee, the Harris Victory Fund, reported having about $4.5 million on hand at the end of March, according to federal records. In recent fundraising emails, Harris has been blunt about the need for Democrats to unify ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.Democrats need to “organize and stop Trump’s agenda while electing Democrats everywhere,” she wrote in recent emails. “There has never been a more important time for a strong Democratic Party — one that is willing to stand up to Donald Trump, Elon Musk and what they are doing to this country.”The event marks a homecoming of sorts. Harris lives in Los Angeles but she is from the San Francisco Bay Area, where her political career is rooted. For her first major speech since the election, she chose familiar terrain and a friendly, in some ways familial, crowd.Lisa Gotbhi, a health care executive in San Francisco, said Harris\\' loss last year was a “shock,\" but “she’s a voice we need and a leader we need. Let’s get back in the fight.”\\n```\\n\\n## [Trump\\'s detachment from reality made clear during disastrous town hall](https://www.dailykos.com/story/2025/5/1/2319892/-Trump-s-disastrous-town-hall-shows-his-detachment-from-reality?pm_campaign=blog&pm_medium=rss&pm_source=) (#46679)\\n\\n> 2025-05-01 17:30:16+00:00\\n\\n```\\n© Kos Media, LLC.\\nSite content may be used for any purpose without explicit permission unless otherwise specified. \\'Kos\\' and \\'Daily Kos\\' are registered trademarks of Kos Media, LLC.\\nPrivacy Policy\\nDaily Kos\\nFront Page\\nComics\\nRSS\\nSubscribe\\nGift Subscriptions\\nAbout\\nTerms\\nRules of the Road\\nDMCA Copyright Notice\\nPrivacy\\nAbout Us\\nMasthead\\nCode of Ethics\\nContact Us\\nAdvertising\\nAdvertising Overview\\nCareers\\nJobs\\nMerchandise\\nShirts\\nConnect With Us\\nDaily Kos moves in solidarity with the Black community.\\nLearn More\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

    "1.  Identifying the most critical overall developments or themes revealed by the stories.\n",
    "2.  Identifying and grouping stories covering related events or themes.\n",
    "3.  Assigning individual story titles and grouped titles to the most appropriate section based on significance and user interests (geopolitics, France, China, tech).\n",
    "4.  **Outputting *only* the section structure and the actual titles of the assigned stories.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Brief Structure & Section Guidelines:** (Use these to categorize)\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`## Main Stories`**: Titles representing the up to 10 most important/impactful overall developments *from this batch*, based on relative significance and thematic importance. Use judgment. If multiple stories cover facets of one *major* event/theme, select the title representing the core update or highest impact for this section. Try to keep the top spots for newest developments (i.e if we reported on something yesterday, it should only be in the top 3 if it's truly huge, otherwise leave the top spots for the newest developments)\n",
    "2.  **`## United Kingdom focus`**: Titles primarily focused on the UK.\n",
    "3.  **`## Global landscape`**: (Includes `### Power & politics`). Titles covering broader geopolitics, international relations.\n",
    "4.  **`## China monitor`**: Titles primarily focused on China (policy, economy, tech, etc.).\n",
    "5.  **`## Economic currents`**: Titles covering significant global/regional economic news, trends, policy, cryptocurrency especially bitcoin news.\n",
    "6.  **`## Tech & science developments`**: Titles covering AI/LLMs, biomed, space breakthroughs, etc.\n",
    "7.  **`## Noteworthy & under-reported`**: Titles for interesting/potentially important stories not fitting elsewhere, emerging trends. (Up to ~5 titles).\n",
    "8.  **`## Positive developments`**: Titles for genuinely positive outcomes. (Include only if applicable).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Analyze Holistically:** First, carefully read *all* provided `<story>` summaries below (titles and summaries) to understand the key events, themes, and potential connections *before* assigning anything. Think about the bigger picture revealed by the collection.\n",
    "2.  **Select \"What You Need To Know Now\":** Identify the *actual titles* of the stories representing the top ~10 most significant overall developments or themes within this batch. List these titles under `## what matters now`, ordered by significance/impact.\n",
    "3.  **Assign & Group Remaining Story Titles:** For the ***remaining*** stories:\n",
    "    *   Assign each story's **actual Title** to the single most appropriate section.\n",
    "    *   **Group Related Titles:** If two or more stories cover the same specific event, interconnected themes, or closely linked developments, place their **actual Titles consecutively** *within* the single most relevant section.\n",
    "    *   **Prioritize Group Placement:** Assign the *entire group* of related titles to the section that best captures their central theme.\n",
    "4.  **Formatting:**\n",
    "    *   Format the output *exactly* as shown in the example below, using the appropriate section headers (`## Section Name`, `### Power & politics`).\n",
    "    *   List **only the actual `Title`** of each story under its assigned section, preceded by `###`.\n",
    "    *   Use `---` as a separator between *each* story title listed.\n",
    "    *   If a section has no relevant stories, **omit the section header entirely**.\n",
    "5.  **Output:**\n",
    "    *   **Do NOT include introductory/concluding text, explanations, the `<story>` tags, or the executive summaries.**\n",
    "    *   **Output ONLY the structured markdown outline consisting of section headers and the actual story titles from the input data.**\n",
    "    \n",
    "**--- CONTEXT FROM PREVIOUS DAY (IF AVAILABLE) ---**\n",
    "*   You *may* receive a section at the beginning of the curated data titled `## Previous Day's Coverage Context (YYYY-MM-DD)`.\n",
    "*   Use this list **only** to understand which topics are ongoing and their last known status/theme.\n",

Also include noteworthy items.\n",

The user values **informed, analytical takes**, grounded in the provided facts, but appreciates directness and avoids generic hedging or forced political correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Task:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Adhere Strictly to the Provided Outline:** The structure (sections and order of topics) of your brief *must* follow the `## Provided Outline` section below exactly.\n",

    "3.  **Connect Outline to Data:** For each `### Title` listed in the `## Provided Outline`, locate the corresponding full story information (summary, metadata) within `<curated_news_data>`.\n",
    "4.  **Synthesize and Analyze:** Write the brief content for that story, following the style and content guidelines for each section. Pay attention to titles grouped consecutively in the outline – these represent related developments; synthesize them coherently, but still apply paragraph structure rules *within* each story's coverage.\n",
    "5.  **Generate Engaging Titles:** For *each* story covered (as dictated by the outline), create an engaging `<u>**title that captures the essence**</u>` for the brief itself. Do *not* just reuse the raw input titles from the outline for the brief's display titles.\n",

    "    *   **Do not cram all information for a single story into one large block of text.** Aim for paragraphs that are typically 3-7 sentences long, varying length for effect but prioritizing clarity.\n",
    "    *   Ensure smooth transitions *between* paragraphs and *between* related stories grouped in the outline.\n",
    "    *   Blend facts and analysis naturally. If there isn't much significant development or analysis *for a specific story*, keep its section concise, possibly with just two or three short paragraphs, but still apply the paragraph break principle where logical.\n",

Use this implicit understanding – give more weight to reliable sources and treat claims from low-reliability sources with appropriate caution in your analysis. Explicit mention isn't needed unless crucial.\n",

A newly released **HHS** report advocating for \"exploratory therapy\" over medical interventions for transgender youth has drawn sharp condemnation from **LGBTQ+** advocates and medical professionals, who see it as thinly veiled conversion therapy. This move aligns with the administration\\'s history of policies perceived as discriminatory towards the **LGBTQ+** community.\\n\\nSimultaneously, **Trump\\'s** \"America First\" foreign policy continues to strain relationships with allies and fuel trade tensions, particularly with **China**. The temporary halt of rare-earth metal exports by **China** is a direct consequence of these tensions. The dismissal of **Mike Waltz** from the administration, while seemingly minor, adds to the perception of instability and internal discord.\\n\\n### <u>**Belichick\\'s CBS Interview Turns Sour: Hudson\\'s Influence Under Scrutiny**</u>\\n\\n**Bill Belichick\\'s** recent **CBS** interview has devolved into a public relations mess, largely due to the alleged influence of his girlfriend, **Jordon Hudson**. The cancellation of a \"Hard Knocks\" series featuring **Belichick\\'s** **North Carolina** team, reportedly due to **Hudson\\'s** demands, has raised eyebrows.\\n\\n**CBS** and **Belichick** are now in disagreement over the interview\\'s scope, with **Belichick** claiming topics about his personal life were off-limits – a claim **CBS** denies. Public figures like **Charles Barkley** are publicly expressing concerns about **Belichick** and **Hudson\\'s** relationship, adding fuel to the fire. The trademark filings by **Hudson\\'s** company, **Trouble Cub Enterprises**, further complicate the situation, suggesting an attempt to capitalize on **Belichick\\'s** brand.\\n\\n### <u>**US and Ukraine Ink Minerals Deal Amidst Fragile Peace Talks with Russia**</u>\\n\\nThe **US** and **Ukraine** have signed a minerals agreement granting the **US** access to **Ukraine\\'s** natural resources, including graphite, titanium, and lithium, in exchange for economic support. This deal aims to establish a Reconstruction Investment Fund to aid **Ukraine\\'s** recovery after the war with **Russia**. **Secretary of State Marco Rubio** has highlighted the importance of the deal as a step toward ending the war.\\n\\nThis agreement occurs amidst ongoing **US-Russia** peace negotiations, where ceasefire terms and the status of **Crimea** remain sticking points. While **Putin** declared a three-day ceasefire, **Zelenskyy** dismissed it as a manipulation attempt, demanding a 30-day ceasefire instead. The timing of the minerals deal sends a clear signal of **US** commitment to **Ukraine**, even as negotiations with **Russia** continue.\\n\\n## Global landscape\\n\\n### Power & politics\\n\\n### <u>**Trump\\'s Gender-Affirming Care Stance and Foreign Policy Draw Fire**</u>\\n\\nThe **Trump** administration\\'s stance on gender-affirming care, as outlined in the new **HHS** report, is likely to further galvanize opposition from progressive groups and medical professionals. The report\\'s advocacy for \"exploratory therapy\" is seen as a direct challenge to established medical guidelines and could have a chilling effect on access to care for transgender youth.\\n\\nOn the foreign policy front, **Trump\\'s** \"America First\" approach continues to isolate the **US** from its traditional allies. The trade war with **China**, exemplified by the rare-earth metal export halt, demonstrates the potential economic consequences of this approach. The administration\\'s actions are creating a more volatile and unpredictable global landscape.\\n\\n### <u>**US Secures Access to Ukrainian Resources Amidst Tense Peace Negotiations**</u>\\n\\nThe minerals agreement between the **US** and **Ukraine** is a strategic move with both economic and geopolitical implications. Securing access to **Ukraine\\'s** natural resources, particularly rare earth minerals, reduces **US** dependence on **China** and strengthens its supply chain. The deal also provides much-needed economic support to **Ukraine**, signaling a long-term commitment to the country\\'s recovery.\\n\\nHowever, the timing of the agreement, amidst ongoing peace negotiations with **Russia**, adds a layer of complexity. While the **US** aims to support a \"free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine,\" the negotiations with **Russia** suggest a willingness to compromise, potentially at **Ukraine\\'s** expense. The differing views on ceasefire conditions highlight the challenges in achieving a lasting peace.\\n\\n## Noteworthy & under-reported\\n\\n### <u>**Belichick\\'s Off-Field Drama: A Cautionary Tale of Influence and Image**</u>\\n\\nThe **Bill Belichick** saga serves as a cautionary tale about the potential pitfalls of unchecked influence and the importance of managing public image. **Jordon Hudson\\'s** alleged demands and trademark filings raise questions about her motivations and the extent of her control over **Belichick\\'s** brand. The public disagreement between **Belichick** and **CBS** further damages his reputation and raises concerns about his judgment.\\n\\nThe situation also highlights the challenges faced by public figures in navigating personal relationships and professional obligations. **Belichick\\'s** coaching career at **UNC** could be impacted by this controversy, as the university may be hesitant to associate itself with such negative publicity.

      "## Main Stories\n",
      "\n",
      "### <u>**HHS Report Sparks Outcry as Trump's Foreign Policy Strains Alliances**</u>\n",
      "\n",
      "The **Trump** administration is facing criticism on multiple fronts. A newly released **HHS** report advocating for \"exploratory therapy\" over medical interventions for transgender youth has drawn sharp condemnation from **LGBTQ+** advocates and medical professionals, who see it as thinly veiled conversion therapy. This move aligns with the administration's history of policies perceived as discriminatory towards the **LGBTQ+** community.\n",
      "\n",
      "Simultaneously, **Trump's** \"America First\" foreign policy continues to strain relationships with allies and fuel trade tensions, particularly with **China**. The temporary halt of rare-earth metal exports by **China** is a direct consequence of these tensions. The dismissal of **Mike Waltz** from the administration, while seemingly minor, adds to the perception of instability and internal discord.\n",
      "\n",
      "### <u>**Belichick's CBS Interview Turns Sour: Hudson's Influence Under Scrutiny**</u>\n",
      "\n",
      "**Bill Belichick's** recent **CBS** interview has devolved into a public relations mess, largely due to the alleged influence of his girlfriend, **Jordon Hudson**. The cancellation of a \"Hard Knocks\" series featuring **Belichick's** **North Carolina** team, reportedly due to **Hudson's** demands, has raised eyebrows.\n",
      "\n",
      "**CBS** and **Belichick** are now in disagreement over the interview's scope, with **Belichick** claiming topics about his personal life were off-limits – a claim **CBS** denies. Public figures like **Charles Barkley** are publicly expressing concerns about **Belichick** and **Hudson's** relationship, adding fuel to the fire. The trademark filings by **Hudson's** company, **Trouble Cub Enterprises**, further complicate the situation, suggesting an attempt to capitalize on **Belichick's** brand.\n",
      "\n",
      "### <u>**US and Ukraine Ink Minerals Deal Amidst Fragile Peace Talks with Russia**</u>\n",
      "\n",
      "The **US** and **Ukraine** have signed a minerals agreement granting the **US** access to **Ukraine's** natural resources, including graphite, titanium, and lithium, in exchange for economic support. This deal aims to establish a Reconstruction Investment Fund to aid **Ukraine's** recovery after the war with **Russia**. **Secretary of State Marco Rubio** has highlighted the importance of the deal as a step toward ending the war.\n",
      "\n",
      "This agreement occurs amidst ongoing **US-Russia** peace negotiations, where ceasefire terms and the status of **Crimea** remain sticking points. While **Putin** declared a three-day ceasefire, **Zelenskyy** dismissed it as a manipulation attempt, demanding a 30-day ceasefire instead. The timing of the minerals deal sends a clear signal of **US** commitment to **Ukraine**, even as negotiations with **Russia** continue.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Global landscape\n",
      "\n",
      "### Power & politics\n",
      "\n",
      "### <u>**Trump's Gender-Affirming Care Stance and Foreign Policy Draw Fire**</u>\n",
      "\n",
      "The **Trump** administration's stance on gender-affirming care, as outlined in the new **HHS** report, is likely to further galvanize opposition from progressive groups and medical professionals. The report's advocacy for \"exploratory therapy\" is seen as a direct challenge to established medical guidelines and could have a chilling effect on access to care for transgender youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the foreign policy front, **Trump's** \"America First\" approach continues to isolate the **US** from its traditional allies. The trade war with **China**, exemplified by the rare-earth metal export halt, demonstrates the potential economic consequences of this approach. The administration's actions are creating a more volatile and unpredictable global landscape.\n",
      "\n",
      "### <u>**US Secures Access to Ukrainian Resources Amidst Tense Peace Negotiations**</u>\n",
      "\n",
      "The minerals agreement between the **US** and **Ukraine** is a strategic move with both economic and geopolitical implications. Securing access to **Ukraine's** natural resources, particularly rare earth minerals, reduces **US** dependence on **China** and strengthens its supply chain. The deal also provides much-needed economic support to **Ukraine**, signaling a long-term commitment to the country's recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the timing of the agreement, amidst ongoing peace negotiations with **Russia**, adds a layer of complexity. While the **US** aims to support a \"free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine,\" the negotiations with **Russia** suggest a willingness to compromise, potentially at **Ukraine's** expense. The differing views on ceasefire conditions highlight the challenges in achieving a lasting peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Noteworthy & under-reported\n",
      "\n",
      "### <u>**Belichick's Off-Field Drama: A Cautionary Tale of Influence and Image**</u>\n",
      "\n",
      "The **Bill Belichick** saga serves as a cautionary tale about the potential pitfalls of unchecked influence and the importance of managing public image. **Jordon Hudson's** alleged demands and trademark filings raise questions about her motivations and the extent of her control over **Belichick's** brand. The public disagreement between **Belichick** and **CBS** further damages his reputation and raises concerns about his judgment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The situation also highlights the challenges faced by public figures in navigating personal relationships and professional obligations. **Belichick's** coaching career at **UNC** could be impacted by this controversy, as the university may be hesitant to associate itself with such negative publicity. The story underscores the importance of transparency and accountability, even for individuals with established reputations.\n"
