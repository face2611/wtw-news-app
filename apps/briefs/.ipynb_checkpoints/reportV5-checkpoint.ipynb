It marks at least the second health-related pick from Trump to be pulled from Senate consideration. Nesheiwat had been scheduled to appear before the Senate health, education, labor and pensions committee on Thursday for her confirmation hearing.Means and her brother, former lobbyist Calley Means, served as key advisers to Kennedy’s longshot 2024 presidential bid and helped broker his endorsement of Trump last summer. The pair made appearances with some of Trump’s biggest supporters, winning praise from conservative pundit Tucker Carlson and podcaster Joe Rogan. Calley Means is currently a White House adviser who appears frequently on television to promote restrictions on Snap benefits, removing fluoride from drinking water and other Maha agenda items.Casey Means has no government experience and dropped out of her surgical residency program, saying she became disillusioned with traditional medicine. She founded a health tech company, Levels, that helps users track blood sugar and other metrics. She also makes money from dietary supplements, creams, teas and other products sponsored on her social media accounts.In interviews and articles, Means and her brother describe a dizzying web of influences to blame for the nation’s health problems, including corrupt food conglomerates that have hooked Americans on unhealthy diets, leaving them reliant on daily medications from the pharmaceutical industry to manage obesity, diabetes and other chronic conditions.Few health experts would dispute that the US diet – full of processed foods – is a contributor to obesity and related problems. But Means goes further, linking changes in diet and lifestyle to a raft of conditions including infertility, Alzheimer’s, depression and erectile dysfunction.“Almost every chronic health symptom that Western medicine addresses is the result of our cells being beleaguered by how we’ve come to live,” Means said in a 2024 book co-written with her brother.Food experts say it’s overly simplistic to declare that all processed foods are harmful, since the designation covers an estimated 60% of US foods, including products as diverse as granola, peanut butter and potato chips.“They are not all created equal,” said Gabby Headrick, a nutrition researcher at George Washington University’s school of public health. “It is much more complicated than just pointing the finger at ultra-processed foods as the driver of chronic disease in the United States.”Means has mostly steered clear of Kennedy’s debunked views on vaccines. But on her website, she has called for more investigation into their safety and recommends making it easier for patients to sue drugmakers in the event of vaccine injuries. Since the late 1980s, federal law has shielded those companies from legal liability to encourage development of vaccines without the threat of costly personal injury lawsuits.She trained as a surgeon at Stanford University but has built an online following by criticizing the medical establishment and promoting natural foods and lifestyle changes to reverse obesity, diabetes and other chronic diseases.If confirmed as surgeon general, Means would be tasked with helping promote Kennedy’s sprawling Maha agenda, which calls for removing thousands of additives and chemicals from US foods, rooting out conflicts of interest at federal agencies and incentivizing healthier foods in school lunches and other nutrition programs.Nesheiwat, Trump’s first pick, is a medical director for an urgent care company in New York and has appeared regularly on Fox News to offer medical expertise and insights. She is a vocal supporter of Trump and shares photos of them together on social media. Nesheiwat is also the sister-in-law of former national security adviser Mike Waltz, who has been nominated to be Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations.Nesheiwat also recently came under criticism from Laura Loomer, a far-right ally of Trump who was instrumental in ousting several members of Trump’s national security council. Loomer posted on Twitter/X earlier this week that “we can’t have a pro-COVID vaccine nepo appointee who is currently embroiled in a medical malpractice case and who didn’t go to medical school in the US” as the surgeon general.Independent freelance journalist Anthony Clark reported last month that Nesheiwat earned her medical degree from the American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine in St Maarten, despite saying that she has a degree from the University of Arkansas School of Medicine.The surgeon general, considered the nation’s doctor, oversees 6,000 US Public Health Service Corps members and can issue advisories that warn of public health threats.In March, the White House pulled from consideration the nomination of former Florida Republican Dave Weldon to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. His skepticism on vaccines had raised concerns from key Republican senators, and he withdrew after being told by the White House that he did not have enough support to be confirmed.The withdrawal was first reported by Bloomberg News.', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Trump nominates Means for Surgeon General\\nENTITIES: Donald Trump, Casey Means, Robert F Kennedy Jr, Janette Nesheiwat\\nEVENT: Trump nominated Dr. Casey Means, linked to RFK Jr., for surgeon general, replacing Janette Nesheiwat.\\nCONTEXT: Means' nomination signals a shift towards alternative medicine perspectives.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 51414, 'sourceId': 12678, 'url': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14688557/canned-beans-recall-states-life-threatening-health-risk-NEW.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490', 'title': \"Canned beans recalled in 23 states over 'life-threatening' health risk\", 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T18:08:09.000Z', 'content': \"18:33, 07 May 2025, updated\\n19:08, 07 May 2025\\nBy\\nLUKE ANDREWS SENIOR HEALTH REPORTER FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\\nREAD MORE: Urgent recall for breakfast item that may contain plastic\\nAn urgent recall\\xa0has been issued for canned beans sold at Walmart\\xa0and other grocers over fears they pose a life-threatening health risk.The FDA\\xa0is recalling 4,510 cases of Yellowstone Brown Sugar Molasses Baked Beans sold across 23 states because they contain undeclared soy.About 1.9million people in the US are allergic to soy, and can suffer from anaphylaxis if they eat the substance — a life-threatening allergic reaction that can leave them gasping for breath.No illnesses or adverse reactions have been reported to date, but the FDA is urging people to throw out the beans or return them to stores for a full refund.The beans are sold in 15-ounce cans with a best-by date of February 17, 2028 — and were made by Tennessee-based Vietti Food Group.The can has a black label with a large, yellow 'Y' on the front, as well a a picture of beans cooking in a saucepan.A representative for the brand said the affected beans were sold in Walmart, Associated Wholesale Grocers, Hy-Vee and Meijer, among others. The above is a stock image of beans. It was a brand sold by Vietti Food Group that was recalled because it contained undeclared soy The above shows the label used on the recalled canned beans The FDA said in its alert: 'Individuals with an allergy or severe sensitivity to soy risk serious or life-threatening allergic reactions if they consume this product.'\\xa0The recall was called in the following states: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Virginia.It was not clear exactly how many cans of beans were being recalled or how the soy had entered the baked beans.But it is likely that the soy was contained in the sauce, where it is used to tone down the sweetness and add depth to the flavor.Food workers then did not declare the sauce's presence on the label, which led to the recall.Soy comes from soybeans and is commonly consumed in foods. It is one of nine major allergens, with the others being milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat and sesame.It poses no risks to someone who does not have a soy allergy.But for patients with this, they can quickly experience a tingling sensation in the mouth and swelling of the lips and face after consuming soy.Experts say they can also break out in hives, itching or eczema, and suffer from abdominal pain, diarrhea and nausea.It comes after a March recall was issued for 200,000 cans of popular vegetables sold at Target over fears they were contaminated with a foreign object.Good & Gather Cut Green Beans - distributed by Target - have been recalled in just about two dozen states, including Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Texas. On February 12, 197,808 cans were recalled. On March 13, the recall was named as the second-highest risk level, or a 'Class II' distinction.The FDA did not explain in its release what sort of foreign object had been found in the cans, but these are typically pits and bones that have not been removed.\", 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Canned beans recalled over undeclared soy\\nENTITIES: FDA, Walmart, Vietti Food Group, Yellowstone Brown Sugar Molasses Baked Beans\\nEVENT: 4,510 cases of Yellowstone Brown Sugar Molasses Baked Beans are recalled across 23 states due to undeclared soy.\\nCONTEXT: Undeclared soy poses a life-threatening risk to those allergic.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 52602, 'sourceId': 12322, 'url': 'https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-politics-newsletter-biden-appointed-judge-orders-refugee-resettlement-resumed', 'title': 'Fox News Politics Newsletter: Biden-appointed Judge Orders Refugee Resettlement Resumed', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T21:53:35.000Z', 'content': 'Welcome to the Fox News Politics newsletter, with the latest updates on the Trump administration, Capitol Hill and more Fox News politics content.Here\\'s what\\'s happening…-Vance previews US-Iran nuclear talks, says Trump \\'open\\' to sitting down with Russians, Chinese in future-Congress moves to address air traffic controller crisis as Newark meltdown sparks alarm-205 arrested in FBI child sex operation, Patel and Bondi announceJudge Orders Refugee Resettlement to ResumeA federal judge on Monday ordered the Trump administration to immediately resettle some 12,000 refugees into the U.S. under a court order that partially blocks President Donald Trump’s executive order aimed at halting the refugee admissions program.\\xa0U.S. District Judge Jamal Whitehead, a 2023 appointee of former President Joe Biden, issued the order despite the Trump administration saying during a hearing last week that it should only have to process 160 refugees into the country and would likely appeal any order requiring thousands to be admitted.\"This Court will not entertain the Government’s result-oriented rewriting of a judicial order that clearly says what it says,\" Whitehead wrote Monday. \"The Government is free, of course, to seek further clarification from the Ninth Circuit.

Launched today by Employment Hero, this mobile app is shaking up the hiring game, offering SMEs a free, fast, and mobile-first way to connect with job seekers.\\nUnlike traditional job boards, EH Jobs is built for the smartphone era, where candidates hunt for work between shifts or on the go. The app’s AI-driven features, like SmartMatch, pair SMEs with local talent in seconds, slashing recruitment time and costs. It also taps into the 80% of jobs never publicly advertised, giving smaller businesses a leg up in a tight labor market.\\nDavid Holland, Managing Director of Talent Solutions at Employment Hero, told reporters: “The job hunt has changed. People aren’t sitting at a desktop scrolling through listings anymore. Job hunting has become part of daily life; Aussies are looking for work between shifts, on the train, on their phone during smoko, even while scrolling TikTok.”\\nTailored for fast-paced SME hiring\\nWith employment growth stuck at 1.5% quarter-on-quarter and wages inching up by just 0.7%, SMEs face mounting pressure to fill roles quickly. EH Jobs delivers with features tailored for shift-based hiring: map-based candidate searches, AI-polished profiles with video intros, and direct 1:1 chats with applicants. Holland highlighted the app’s speed: “EH Jobs is designed for that reality, a fast, mobile-first experience that removes friction on both sides of the marketplace and integrates with how people use technology today. Our record so far is just 18 minutes from a candidate seeing a business listing and successfully scheduling a Trial Shift. I expect that record will continue to tumble.”\\nThe app’s focus on casual and frontline roles is a boon for SMEs, which employ 70% of Australia’s workforce but often lack the HR firepower of larger firms. “This isn’t just another job board,” Holland said. “We’re bringing a sense of immediacy to job seeking, especially for those in casual and shift-based roles, where speed and simplicity make all the difference.”\\nEH Jobs also integrates with Employment Hero’s broader platform, offering SMEs tools to streamline HR and payroll. A new feature, ShiftSync, allows SMEs to post real-time shift openings directly to the app, instantly notifying nearby candidates who match the job criteria. This ensures businesses can fill last-minute vacancies, a common pain point in hospitality and retail. “EH Jobs is the front door to a more connected employment experience; one that benefits jobseekers and businesses alike,” Holland added.\\nFor more information, visit\\xa0employmenthero.com\\nKeep up to date with our stories on\\xa0LinkedIn,\\xa0Twitter,\\xa0Facebook\\xa0and\\xa0Instagram.', 'location': 'AUS', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Employment Hero launches free SME hiring app\\nENTITIES: Employment Hero, David Holland, Australian SMEs\\nEVENT: Employment Hero launched EH Jobs, a free mobile app designed to help Australian SMEs in hospitality, retail, and frontline sectors quickly connect with job seekers.\\nCONTEXT: App helps SMEs tackle talent shortages with mobile-first approach.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 49407, 'sourceId': 12490, 'url': 'https://www.pcworld.com/article/2774978/microsoft-trims-its-low-end-surfaces-to-make-room-for-smaller-models.html', 'title': 'Microsoft trims its low-end Surfaces to make room for smaller models', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T19:51:59.000Z', 'content': \"Image: Microsoft\\nAfter introducing smaller, lower-priced Surface devices this week, Microsoft has quietly raised the prices of its older Surface devices to compensate — well, kind of.\\nMicrosoft launched a new 13-inch Surface Laptop for as low as $899.99 and a 12-inch Surface Pro for $799.99. The two devices are just a tad smaller than the existing Surface Laptop and Surface Pro and slightly cheaper as well: the base prices of the existing, older Surface Laptop 7th Edition and the Surface Pro 11th Edition are $999.\\nAs reported by XDA Developers, Microsoft has now widened the pricing gap, implementing a $200 difference between the smaller Surface Pro and Laptop and the existing models from May 2024. But that’s not precisely true, either.\\nInstead, Microsoft has eliminated the lowest-priced 13.8-inch Surface Laptop offering from its website. Last May, you could buy a 13.8-inch Surface Laptop, in Platinum, with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD storage, for $999, according to the price list Microsoft provided us. Now, the cheapest 13.8-inch Surface Laptop is a Black model but with 16GB of RAM and a larger 512GB SSD instead, with an MSRP of $1,199.99 — but one of those models, too, has been marked down to a discounted $1,031.47. (Microsoft sometimes offers educational or military discounts, but I used an anonymous browser to check that information.) Otherwise, the MSRP of that model remains the same as last May.\\nIt also appears that the remaining devices in the existing 13.8- and 15-inch Surface Laptop line have retained the same pricing as before, too.\\nIn the 15-inch Laptop, Microsoft says that the cheapest $1,299 option (a Platinum model with a Snapdragon X Elite, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD) is out of stock. But the next step up the ladder remains unchanged at $1,499.99 for a black laptop with an X Elite / 16GB RAM / 512GB SSD.. The other models are, too, up to the top-of-the-line $2,499 model, which is now out of stock as well.\\nMicrosoft appears to be making slight tweaks in its Surface Pro line as well. Again, Microsoft appears to have removed all of its Surface Pro 11th Edition models with 256GB of SSD storage. That effectively eliminated the cheapest $999.99 model from last year. Now, the cheapest 13-inch Surface Pros carry an MSRP of $1,199 for models with Wi-Fi, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. Even then, Microsoft has marked down the Sapphire version to $1,029.99, a $170 discount.\\nOtherwise, it seems like the other Surface Pro prices, for both the OLED and LCD models, remain the same. (A $1,299 Platinum model is now out of stock.)\\nEssentially, Microsoft is raising prices by eliminating its cheapest options from its existing Surface Pro and Surface Laptop lineups and carving out more space for the smaller Surfaces to exist. And it’s unclear whether Microsoft will leave those discounts at the low end in place.\\nFor now, though, it appears that the Surface prices are safe.\\nAuthor: Mark Hachman, Senior Editor, PCWorld\\nMark has written for PCWorld for the last decade, with 30 years of experience covering technology.

Well, now we know.Samsung’s just dropped invites for its next Galaxy Unpacked, and it’s an entirely virtual affair with a clear focus – the Galaxy S25 Edge. Even with its ultra-thin design that will land at under the Galaxy S25\\'s 7.2-milimeters, it\\'s still poking its way through the center of the invite.The invite image reveals, under a cloth of some kind, the super slim silhouette. It’s accompanied by “Beyond slim” on the left and “May 12, 2025 Live on samsung.com” on the right.That basically gives it away, and Samsung will stream this Galaxy Unpacked at 8pm ET/5pm PT/1am BST/ (10am AEST on May 13, 2025 in Australia) live on its site and on YouTube.(Image credit: Samsung)A shared blog post from Samsung details much more on this addition to the Galaxy S lineup and actually names the Galaxy S25 Edge, writing, “This is more than a slim smartphone.” It teases that the Galaxy S25 Edge will offer flagship-level performance with ‘superior portability’ without compromising on any of it, seemingly.It also confirms a key spec for the Edge that’s been rummored alongside many others. “Even with its slim form, Galaxy S25 Edge’s 200MP wide lens continues Galaxy’s iconic camera experience, delivering pro-grade capabilities to intuitively capture the world around you,” thus confirming the ultra-slim phone will have a very sharp main shooter. It will also match the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which has the same sensor for the primary lens.Samsung’s really highlighting that it took a lot of engineering work to make the Galaxy S25 Edge a reality and that it didn’t have any shortcomings that would have dropped it from the mainline Galaxy S family of phones. Much of the May 12 Galaxy Unpacked will likely delve into how this device came to be.Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.(Image credit: Future/Lance Ulanoff)We still expect the Galaxy S25 Edge to arrive at a premium price, somewhere above $999 / £999 / AU$1,699. It should feature the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy inside, considering that’s powering the rest of the lineup. We also expect it to match 12GB of RAM, which should make it a speedy and efficient phone, but we also don’t yet know what size battery Samsung’s been able to squeeze inside the svelte frame.The latest rumors point to the Galaxy S25 Edge having a titanium frame, weighing only 163 grams, and only 5.85 millimeters thick. That same report claims the Galaxy S25 Edge will have a 6.7-inch AMOLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, which aligns with previous reports.The best news is that we’re just days away from this being official and Samsung telling us all about the Galaxy S25 Edge. It’s also the start of a new category of sorts – ultra-slim, premium smartphones for the masses, and Samsung will, in turn, be beating Apple to the punch before the much-rumored iPhone 17 Air sees the light of day.Now, if you’re already sold on the Galaxy S25 Edge – maybe you’ve been holding out on getting an S25, S25 Plus, or S25 Ultra – Samsung is rolling out an early offer. You can sign up to reserve the next Galaxy, with no commitment to purchasing or strings attached, and score a $50 Samsung Credit towards the S25 Edge.You might also likeThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge has just leaked in full – including specs, renders, and pricingExclusive: the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge will have durability to match its ‘sexy’ design\\nJacob Krol is the US Managing Editor, News for TechRadar.

And the world will have to be patient for at least a few more hours, as the cardinals in the conclave break for lunch and convene again for the next secret ballot.On Thursday morning, crowds gathered in St. Peter’s Square as the 133 cardinals voted in total secrecy. The black smoke prompted gasps and then groans from the crowds in St. Peter’s Square as they understood that no candidate had captured two-thirds of the cardinal electorate during voting in the morning. Pope Francis’ death in April set in motion the process of choosing his successor, the first conclave in more than a decade. The papal election is one of the world’s oldest dramas, but this one is unlike any other. It is the largest ever assembled, and many cardinals appointed by Francis are meeting one another for the first time.The new faces bring unfamiliar politics, priorities and concerns that some experts say could make the selection process more fragmented than usual. Francis also left the church deeply divided, with progressive factions pushing for more inclusion and change, and conservatives seeking to roll things back, often under the guise of preserving unity.Here’s what to know:How it works: Except for Wednesday, when there was only one vote, the cardinals will participate in four rounds of voting every day until a candidate achieves a two-thirds majority. The ballots are burned up to twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon, and smoke emitted from a purpose-built chimney above the Sistine Chapel signals the result — black smoke for no decision, white if there is a pope.How long it takes: There is no indication of how long the conclave will go, though the last two conclaves reached decisions within two days. One in the 13th century dragged on for almost three years.Extreme secrecy: Some security experts say the conclave is the most secure vote anywhere. The closed-door process, which is designed to be leakproof, has been fine-tuned over the centuries.Referendum on Francis: The election in many ways will turn on whether the cardinals want a pope who will follow Francis’ path of openness and inclusion or forge a different one. During his 12-year pontificate, Francis made landmark declarations that encouraged liberals, including allowing the blessing of people in same-sex unions and raising his voice for migrants.Here are 7 key issues dividing the Roman Catholic Church.ImageCardinals in Vatican City after the death of Pope Francis. A conclave to choose his successor is to start on Wednesday.Credit...James Hill for The New York TimesThe cardinals who are electing the next pope sometimes look as ideologically polarized as many secular voters around the globe. Many conservative Roman Catholic Church leaders disagreed with Pope Francis, who was often a darling of liberals around the world.But the typical divisions between progressives and conservatives don’t correspond so neatly with the ideological battles within the Vatican and the broader church. Complex debates are ongoing over the role of women and L.G.B.T.Q. Catholics in the church, whether priests should be able to marry, accountability for sexual abuse by priests and other divisive questions.More than any single issue, the choice of the next pontiff will be dominated by a philosophical question: Who deserves a say in determining the church’s future?AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTCardinals are supposed to pick up the voting this afternoon. They are set to have two more rounds of voting today, unless they elect a pope on the first. Interest in the ‘Conclave’ movie has soared. How accurate is it?ImageA scene from “Conclave,” a fictionalized account of the selection of a new pope.Credit...Focus Features, via Associated PressThe death of Pope Francis last month drove a surge of interest in the 2024 movie “Conclave,” a fictionalized account of the selection of a new pope.Streaming views rose 3,200 percent week-over-week, according to the tracking firm Luminate. When Amazon Prime Video made the film available at no extra cost to subscribers the day after the pope’s death, the number of minutes watched jumped to 18.3 million, from 574,000 a week earlier.The movie was “quite accurate, save for a few things,” said Kurt Martens, a professor of canon law at the Catholic University of America.ImageA scene from “Conclave.”Credit...Focus Features, via Associated PressBut, of course, not all the details of the process have leaked. “On some level, very few people outside the College of Cardinals can really speak to the reality” of what takes place, said Piotr H. Kosicki, an associate professor of history at the University of Maryland who focuses on Roman Catholicism.Here’s what happens in the film, and what papal experts say is accurate about its depiction of Vatican rituals.What’s ‘Conclave’ about?The film opens with the death of an unnamed fictional pope and follows the process and drama of a papal election.It stars Ralph Fiennes as Cardinal Thomas Lawrence, the dean of the College of Cardinals, with Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow, Lucian Msamati and Sergio Castellitto playing top papal contenders.The film follows the cardinals through several voting sessions, meals in a shared cafeteria and the rooms in the papal palace where they are sequestered.The emphasis on secrets and remaining insulated — the world conclave comes from the Latin for “with key” — has no doubt contributed to the interest in “Conclave,” which experts say does a reasonably good job of capturing this special moment in the workings of the Vatican.How much of the voting is shown?Many of the rituals in the film — the prayers being said, the burning of the ballots, a needle being woven through the ballots — are “more or less correct,” Dr. Kosicki said.During the voting process, each cardinal writes the name of one person on a rectangular ballot. Votes are announced aloud one by one, and each ballot is threaded with a single needle before being burned. Four rounds of voting are permitted daily.Some rituals depicted in the film take place in a mix of English and Spanish. In reality, Dr. Kosicki said, “prayer in the Vatican is in Italian or in Latin, period.”Is there as much cutthroat politicking in real life?While it is impossible to say exactly what goes on within the confines of the conclave, electing a pope is similar to electing a head of state, said Massimo Faggioli, a professor of history at Villanova University who specializes in the administrative inner workings of the Catholic Church and of the papacy.The politicking begins in earnest after the pope has died during what is called sede vacante, the period when the seat is vacant. But unlike in a standard governmental election, overt campaigning is taboo, Vatican experts say.Is it common for the cardinals to go multiple rounds without reaching a decision?The conclave process was created in the early Middle Ages to ensure that a new pope could be chosen quickly. The film “Conclave” depicts a pope being chosen over three days and seven ballots. In the last couple of centuries, conclaves haven’t lasted more than four days, Dr. Faggioli said. Pope Benedict XVI was elected in two days in 2005, as was Pope Francis in 2013.“Everyone likes it when things go fast because it means a show of unity,” Dr. Kosicki said. “And it means a strong sort of message being sent to the outside world, to the 1.4 billion Catholics.”After black smoke at noon, the crowd in St. Peter’s hopes for white smoke at night.ImageReacting as black smoke rises from the Sistine Chapel chimney on Thursday morning.Credit...Amanda Perobelli/ReutersAnticipation had been building in St. Peter’s Square on Thursday morning as people started to think in earnest that the cardinals would elect a new pope. But when the first smoke of the day came, just before noon, it was black — indicating that there was still no consensus inside the Sistine Chapel, where the cardinals were voting.Because the past two conclaves to elect Francis and Benedict XVI lasted two days, many of the faithful and tourists milling around the square as a light morning rain turned into bright sunshine said they expected white smoke on Thursday but not until the evening.So when the black smoke came at midday, most were not that surprised, training their cellphones on the giant screens flanking the square where they could see the smoke pumping out of the chimney.Judith Duru, 22, a nursing student in Rome from Nigeria, filmed the smoke on the screen because she could not see the actual smoke from where she was standing. She said she trusted the cardinals to select a “pope with a good heart, who can care for your people, understand your people.” Although she comes from a continent with a fast-growing Catholic population, she said she did not care where the new pope hailed from.“I don’t do politics and religion,” she said. “It does not matter to me” where he comes from, she added. “A good pope will touch everyone.”Before the first smoke signal of the day, Joaquín Cáceres, 30, and Lucía Pérez, 28, Argentines who live in Spain, said they had made a wager on Wednesday night after seeing the first plume of black smoke come out of the Sistine Chapel chimney.“He thinks this morning, on the third ballot,” Ms. Pérez said.“She thinks this afternoon, on the fifth ballot — like Francis,” Mr. Cáceres said.Although neither had a favorite contender, both said they hoped the cardinals would want to continue Francis’ work.“The conclave and the Holy Spirit always work in mysterious ways,” Ms. Pérez said. “But they don’t turn a deaf ear to what people say.”The crowd on Thursday morning was decidedly smaller than the many thousands of people who attended on Wednesday night, probably because a lot of Italians were at work, but perhaps also indicative of expectations that white smoke was more likely to come in the evening. The crowd remained heavily international on Thursday morning, with flags from across the world on view.Several onlookers said they planned to stick around all day — and came prepared.Philipp and Kathrin Wilmes, tourists from Germany, crammed their sightseeing into Monday and Tuesday so that they could wait for six hours in St. Peter’s Square on Wednesday to see the smoke. On Thursday, Mr. Wilmes, 45, had slathered his face with sunscreen expecting another long day. He and his wife, 39, had jackets, bread and water in their backpacks because they said they did not plan to move from their spot against the barrier closest to the basilica. The couple had tickets to fly back to Germany on Friday, and were hoping for an election before then.Maciej Czaharyn, 33, who is Polish but lives in Iceland, spent seven hours in the square on Wednesday. “I was standing all the time,” he said. “But it was worth the sacrifice.”On Thursday, Mr. Czaharyn brought a thin cushion to sit on the ground and a grocery bag filled with bottles of electrolyte drinks, chocolate cookies and cigarettes, “even though you can’t smoke in here,” he said.A group of sophomores from the University of Dallas, a Catholic school, had been studying near Marino, Italy, this year and extended their stay for the conclave. They sat in a circle on the ground playing a card game. They had a large bag of chocolate chip cookies and sandwich fixings.Some Italians found their way to St. Peter’s, too.Flavia Valle, 16, who was lying on the cobblestones not far from the barrier closest to the basilica, said that she and several friends were skipping high school.“I want to see the pope come out,” she said, pointing at the balcony framed by thick, red velvet curtains where the new pontiff traditionally makes a first appearance once the white smoke signals his election.She said she was hoping for another charismatic pope in the mode of Francis. “He talked to the guys, people my age,” she said. “I liked him.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTA call for ‘unity’ in the conclave sounds divisive to some.ImageCardinals returned to St. Peter’s Basilica after Pope Francis’ funeral in April.Credit...James Hill for The New York TimesEven before Pope Francis was entombed in a Rome basilica, conservative cardinals who felt his pontificate was a divisive disaster that endangered the church’s traditions had begun politicking to sway the conclave.They have a seductively simple slogan: unity.It is hard to imagine a less offensive rallying cry, but in the ears of Francis’ most committed supporters, it rings as a code word for rolling back Francis’ more inclusive vision of the Roman Catholic Church.The concerns are a clear sign of the maneuvering by ideological camps as the cardinals vote for Francis’ successor. Among the deeply contested issues are whether the next pope should push forward, or roll back, Francis’ openness to potentially ordaining women as deacons, making some married men clergy or offering communion to divorced and remarried Catholics.Some progressives within the church worry that the dozens of new cardinals Francis chose around the world will be less versed in Vaticanese and may be taken in by the sweetness of the unity siren.“It sounds really good,” said Cardinal Michael Czerny of Canada, who was one of Francis’ closest advisers, but “it means reversal.”“The black smoke is not surprising. The cardinals need some time to decide.”John Trecker, 39, a software engineer from Kansas City.Videotranscriptbars0:00/0:24-0:00transcriptI lost count, but I think the second or third black smoke is not surprising. The Cardinals need some time to decide. This is the most diverse set of cardinals, the biggest number in ever. And they don’t know each other. They need to understand the needs of the church now, and each other, before they can make a good decision. Yeah, but we’re here just to pray for them to make that decision.An Italian cardinal, Gianfranco Ravasi, who is 82 and not voting in the conclave, said that he had been impressed by a speech from Cardinal Jean-Marc Aveline of Marseille, France, who has emerged as a papal contender. Cardinal Aveline, who is learning Italian, read his speech in “perfect Italian,” Cardinal Ravasi said, adding, “He only got two accents wrong.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTWhile younger cardinals are busy choosing the new pope, older cardinals are mostly waiting it out like the rest of us (cardinals over age 80 are not allowed to vote). But many have attended meetings with the other, voting cardinals over the past two weeks, so they have thoughts about the next pontiff. The Vatican’s spokesman declined to say what time the voting began this morning, so it is hard to say how long it took the cardinals to cast their ballots in each vote.The black smoke suggests that three votes have now taken place, and a two-thirds majority has not been reached.VideoCreditCredit...Vatican Media, via ReutersAt first there was a gasp in the press room because the smoke looked a little white... but two seconds later, it was very clearly black.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHundreds of people in St. Peter’s Square raised their cell phones to the giant screens that showed the black smoke rising.

Here’s a glossary with some of the key words and phrases that are used in the process after a pope dies.A convent asks people to spiritually adopt a voting cardinal.ImageOn a convent’s website, people can pick a cardinal to support with prayer in the election of the pope.Credit...James Hill for The New York TimesA convent in a Northern Italian seaside city is encouraging people to pick a voting cardinal to accompany in prayer through its “Adopt a Cardinal” initiative.The convent, in Rimini in the Emilia-Romagna region, is calling on the faithful to pray for a cardinal to be guided by the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary in his choice for a new pope.People can sign up at a local church in Rimini or through the website of the convent, which houses a community of Poor Clares, also known as the Clarisses.The nuns have been clear that it is not a popularity contest. “We specify that this not a poll nor a Toto-Papa,” the website says, referring to the term for papal election predictions much used by Italian journalists. “We are not inviting people to choose the one who will become pope, but rather a cardinal to accompany with a special prayer in the election of the pope.”According to the site, all 133 cardinals have been adopted by at least one person. As of Thursday morning, 1,173 people had made a choice.No word on who has the most prayers.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTPeople are gathering in St. Peter’s Square to wait for the outcome of the next secret ballot.I just crossed the Tiber River on the Ponte Sant’Angelo.

Yesterday, as the hours stretched on and the Vatican’s live video stream was trained on a chimney atop the Sistine Chapel that was not billowing smoke, gulls kept landing on the nearby roof, sometimes to increasingly insistent clapping from those waiting in the square.

The cardinals were scheduled to hold a Mass and prayers before heading to the Sistine Chapel for a second round of voting.With no result — and no smoke — expected imminently, St. Peter’s Square was almost deserted in the early morning, except for a few tourists and tour groups. But by 10 a.m., a crowd had started to gather. Few people looked up at the chimney of the Sistine Chapel — the focus of the Wednesday night’s anticipation.Lorena Belloso, 48, from Argentina and her husband were among the few in the square. “We came for a vacation to Spain and Italy, but we are Catholic believers and now we are waiting for the new pope,” she said. “It’s a historic moment.”On Wednesday evening, tens of thousands of people packed the square to wait for the outcome of the first ballot. A result had been expected early in the evening, but it wasn’t until 9 p.m. that black smoke rose from the chimney, signaling that the cardinals had not reached a consensus on a new pope. Applause, cheers and gasps of disappointment broke out among the crowd, which quickly vacated the square.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTStarting today, the cardinals will vote twice in the morning and twice in the afternoon. There will be smoke at the end of the morning session and the afternoon session, unless a pope is elected earlier.The cardinals were scheduled to hold a Mass and morning prayers at the Apostolic Palace early on Thursday before heading to the Sistine Chapel for a second round of voting.

No phones, no internet: The cardinals vote in extreme secrecy.ImageThe process of selecting a new pope, which takes place in the Sistine Chapel, is intended to be leakproof.Credit...Dimitar Dilkoff/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesNo cellphones. No internet. No television. No contact with the outside world. Welcome to the conclave, which some security experts say is the most secure vote anywhere.The ancient, closed-door selection process that began in the Sistine Chapel on Wednesday was intended to be leakproof. Popes have been fine-tuning the procedure for centuries.The last major changes to the rules came in 1996 and were laid out in a document written by Pope John Paul II, “Universi Dominici Gregis: On the Vacancy of the Apostolic See and the Election of the Roman Pontiff.”Before a single vote was cast on Wednesday, the chapel was cleared of all but the cardinal electors. (This time there are 133 of them.) The room was swept for listening and transmission devices. The windows were boarded up. Jamming devices are routinely used, to ensure that the proceedings cannot be interfered with, or snooped on.The participants all took an oath to uphold the sanctity — and, in essence, the security — of the vote. The process is almost entirely tech-free: Cardinals write their votes by hand on paper ballots, and then proceed one at a time to the altar to place their ballots in an urn.Nine cardinals oversee the process. Three are known as “scrutineers,” tasked with counting and recounting the votes and three are “revisers” who double-check their work.All of this creates “enormous social — religious, actually — disincentives to hacking the vote” or leaking details, Bruce Schneier, a security expert and lecturer at Harvard Kennedy School, wrote in a 2005 blog post.Twenty years later, with smartphones and recording devices nearly everywhere, Mr. Schneier reflected on the security of the voting. In an interview last week, he said that he still considered the conclave to be nearly hackproof. (On a scale of one to 10, with 10 being unhackable, Mr. Schneier gave it a 9.9.)“It’s a small manual process, which makes it more secure,” he added. But that also makes it nearly impossible to replicate for national elections. “There are no lessons for the real world,” he said, “because it doesn’t scale.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHow long will the conclave take?No one knows how long the conclave will last.There is no formal time limit: until two-thirds of the 133 voting Roman Catholic cardinals agree on a new pope, they must continue to vote. Past papal selections have lasted from just a few hours to nearly three years. In the 13th century, the tradition of sequestering the cardinals during the conclave started after residents in Viterbo, near Rome, where it was being held, grew frustrated with a selection process that dragged on almost three years. Locals locked the squabbling cardinals in the papal palace in Viterbo and had the roof removed, subjecting them to the elements. They also cut down their food rations until they made a selection. Pope Gregory X finally emerged as their choice after 33 months.It’s no wonder that Gregory X scrambled to come up with fixed rules for the conclave, which comes from the Latin “with key.” They included reducing meals to one a day if a pope was not elected after three days, and to only bread and water after five more days. But some papal elections continued to drag on. In the 17th and 18th centuries, European Catholic monarchies used their influence over loyal cardinals to shape the outcome, meaning that votes sometimes dragged on for months.Conclaves have become considerably shorter in the past two centuries, after the end of the pope’s temporal power in 1870.The last two popes, Francis and Benedict XVI, were each elected within two days.Cardinals provided varying estimates of how long this conclave would last. Some said the process may take longer than recent selections because the members of the large and diverse College of Cardinals, many of them appointed by Pope Francis in recent years, don’t know each other well. Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan of New York said he thought the conclave would be longer than the one that elected Francis. He has packed 12 packets of peanut butter, and enough to eat three a day. “I think it’ll be longer than last time,” he said.Others predict the cardinals will converge on a well-known name and wrap it up fast.“Everyone says that, but I don’t know how they know,” Cardinal Anders Arborelius of Sweden said in a recent interview. Maybe, he said, “Everyone wants to get home as soon as possible.” Elizabeth Dias contributed reporting.When will the cardinals vote next?ImagePeople watching a screen in St. Peter’s Square showing cardinals in the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican on Wednesday.Credit...Amanda Perobelli/ReutersVoting for the next pope will resume on Thursday morning and continue four times a day until a two-thirds majority reaches a consensus.The next vote by the 133 cardinals gathered in a conclave in Vatican City is expected to take place around 10:30 a.m. local time (4:30 a.m. Eastern), and the second around noon.If neither vote is successful, the next two ballots will take place around 5:30 p.m. and 7 p.m. on Thursday.Casting, reading and incinerating the secret ballots can take a while, so those times are only estimates.The voting procedure is precisely choreographed. All 133 voting cardinals must write the name of the man he sees as pope on a rectangular piece of paper under the phrase “Eligo in Summum Pontificem,” or “I elect as the supreme pontiff.” Cardinals individually walk their ballots to the chapel’s altar, where they say an oath in Latin, and leave the ballot on a plate.Votes are counted before being read aloud and pierced and tied together with a red string (the “Conclave” film depicted this practice). After ballots are counted, they are burned.Smoke emerges from the Sistine Chapel up to twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Black smoke tells the world that the cardinals haven’t reached a decision; white smoke announces that a new pope has been chosen.Both of the past two popes — Benedict XVI in 2005 and Francis in 2013 — were elected in two days. For the past two centuries, each pope was selected within four days or fewer.The cardinal electors will take Sunday off for prayer if a pope has not been selected by Saturday afternoon.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTPaper ballots and sacred oaths: the objects guiding the conclave.The conclave to elect the next pope is now underway at the Vatican. The cardinals — the prelates who are just below the pope in the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy — will vote by secret ballot for a successor to Pope Francis until one candidate earns a two-thirds majority.While we may not know what’s being said during the conclave — it is off limits to outsiders — we do have a pretty good idea what it will look like. During the gathering, the cardinals will follow specific instructions and use several distinctive objects to facilitate the process, many steeped in tradition.Here’s a look at some of those objects, and the meaning behind them.Voting InstrumentsWhen the cardinals vote in the Sistine Chapel, they will be sitting in rows of simple wooden tables. At one end of the chapel, a large table is set up for those who run the voting, according to the Universi Dominici Gregis, or U.D.G., one of the documents used to govern the papal transition.The room also contains voting instruments, including an urn to receive the ballots, a set of wooden balls, and a needle and twine. The urn is used to collect the ballots, rectangular pieces of paper printed with the Latin phrase “Eligo in Summum Pontificem” (“I elect as Supreme Pontiff”).The ballots contain a space where each cardinal writes in the name of his chosen candidate. The ballots are placed in the urn and are removed for counting after all the cardinals have voted.The wooden balls are used to keep track of the ballots. The balls have numbers written on them that correspond to the number of cardinals voting in the conclave. As the ballots are being counted, an attendant removes one of the wooden balls for each ballot, to ensure that the number matches the number of cardinals, according to The Catholic Advocate, formerly a newspaper of the Archdiocese of Newark, N.J. If the numbers don’t match, the ballots must be burned without being read and another vote is conducted immediately, according to the U.D.G.As the ballots are being read, they are pierced with the needle through the word “Eligo” and strung onto the thread, “so that the ballots can be more securely preserved,” according to the U.D.G.ImageMembers of the clergy and conclave staff taking the oath of secrecy in the Pauline Chapel earlier this week.Credit...The VaticanThe Oath of SecrecyThe conclave is a secretive institution, and many steps are taken to prevent leaks, including restricting the cardinals’ use of phones, the internet and newspapers.The members of the College of Cardinals, the body that will elect the pope, must also swear and sign an oath of secrecy, according to the U.D.G. The oath reads, in part: “I will observe absolute and perpetual secrecy with all who are not part of the College of Cardinal electors concerning all matters directly or indirectly related to the ballots cast and their scrutiny for the election of the Supreme Pontiff.”The cardinals also must promise not to record anything in Vatican City during the time of the election. The punishment for breaking the oath is “automatic” excommunication, according to the oath.ImageA temporary stove in the Sistine Chapel in a photo provided by the Vatican.Credit...The VaticanThe StoveThe weekend before the conclave began, Vatican workers installed a simple stove in which ballots would be burned in the Sistine Chapel. Fire crews also installed a chimney on the roof of the chapel, where the smoke will leave the building.After each round of voting, the ballots are mixed with chemicals that, when burned, emit either black or white smoke. Black smoke means that the cardinals have not yet reached the requisite majority; white smoke means that a new pope has been elected and voting is over.The SealAt the beginning of the conclave, the Apostolic Palace, which contains the Sistine Chapel, is closed to the public. On Wednesday, members of the Pontifical Swiss Guard placed beaded ropes with the guard’s seal at the entrances to the palace to ensure privacy and maintain secrecy for the cardinals.The Vatican City government also planned to deactivate cellphone service within its territory for the duration of the conclave, starting on Wednesday afternoon.The Papal VestmentsAfter a pope is elected, he is taken to the “Room of Tears,” a small room next to the Sistine Chapel, where he will put on the white papal cassock for the first time. Garments in three sizes are prepared and kept in the room, since no one knows who — or what size — the next pope will be.The room is known as the “Room of Tears” because there are accounts of previous popes becoming overwhelmed with emotion in the room, and being moved to tears, after their election. After the pope puts on the vestments, he is introduced to the public for the first time.', 'location': 'N/A', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Black smoke: No pope elected, conclave continues\\nENTITIES: Pope Francis, Cardinals, Vatican, Sistine Chapel\\nEVENT: Cardinals failed to elect a new pope on the second day of the conclave, indicated by black smoke.

He also noted that \"Teamsters are professional drivers who safely handle all conditions with miles driven in the real world.\"The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued a\\xa0Second Amended Standing General Order 2021-01 requiring manufacturers and operators of vehicles with automated driving systems (ADS) or level 2 advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to report crashes to the agency.This order mandates the reporting of specific crash-related information when ADS or level 2 ADAS is engaged or was recently in use, enabling NHTSA to monitor potential safety defects in these vehicles and ensure compliance with safety standards. The goal is to proactively address safety concerns related to these technologies as they evolve, in accordance with the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act. Driverless big rig robotruck (Aurora)What this means for the futureThere are undeniable upsides. Autonomous trucks could operate 24/7, slash delivery times, reduce costs and help address the growing driver shortage. They may even improve road safety by eliminating accidents caused by human error. But risks remain. Public trust in driverless tech is still shaky. Many worry about what happens to jobs when machines take the wheel. The Teamsters are particularly vocal about this.\"Tens of millions of people turn a key for a living, but companies like Aurora couldn\\'t care less if they lose their livelihoods. Eliminating all driving jobs would be disastrous for our communities and the middle class,\" McQuaid said.That said, a\\xa0Department of Transportation (DOT) study from the Trump administration projected long-haul autonomous trucking could increase U.S. employment by 26,400-35,100 jobs per year as new logistics and tech roles emerge.

The man who drove his car through Jennifer Aniston’s gates has been charged with stalking and vandalism. “Stalking is a crime that can quickly escalate from harassment to dangerous, violent actions, threatening the safety of victims and our communities,” District Attorney Nathan Hotchman said in a statement obtained by Variety. “My office is committed to aggressively prosecuting those who stalk and terrorize others, ensuring they are held accountable.” Along with one count of stalking and one of vandalism, Jimmy Wayne Carwyle faces an aggravating circumstance of the threat of great bodily harm, which would beef up his sentence if convicted. He faces three years in state prison.\\nOriginal story follows.\\nThe man who was arrested for allegedly driving a car through the gates outside Jennifer Aniston’s home in Los Angeles is now being investigated for possible stalking, law enforcement told TMZ. The Friends star was at home when the incident happened, and her security is said to have held 48-year-old Jimmy Wayne Carwyle at gunpoint until officers arrived and booked him on suspicion of felony vandalism. A public Facebook account under Carwyle’s name has previously made multiple disturbing posts about Aniston, including several that refer to her as his wife or soulmate. A September 2024 post addressed to Aniston declares in all caps, “I fucking love you, come get me or call me, tell me our address!, If not, I’m coming hunting next weekend!” The following month, another all-caps post suggests that there are forces of “corruption” keeping them apart.\\nCarwyle quit his job as an automobile-service technician five years ago and has since suffered from delusions that he is a Christlike figure who is married to Aniston, his childhood friend Steve Rhea claimed to NBC News on Tuesday. According to Rhea, Carwyle left his native Mississippi in September to start living out of his car at a Walmart in Burbank. “We just hope he gets the help he needs,” Rhea said. “I hope there’s some way to fix him, but I don’t know.” Carwyle, who has not been formally charged, is currently being held in the L.A.

Police say they are not looking for anyone else. One of the Gibson children caught in the Toowoomba fire Homicide detectives were called to assist in Queensland Police's investigation on Wednesday 'The 18 year old male and the 34 year old did assist with removing or assisting with the children getting from that premises,'\\xa0said Detective Superintendent George Marchesini on Thursday.'And I believe the 36 year old woman had escaped that house as well, was located towards the front of the premises.'We have detectives from the Darling Down district, along with the homicide investigation unit assisting this investigation.'We also brought in other specialist teams to assist, and some of that takes part with the forensic and scientific examination at the scene.\\xa0'As part of our investigation, we'll be looking at any interaction or communication from the family with police prior to this incident.'The two men were taken to a Toowoomba hospital with Mr Gibson in a stable condition with serious injuries while the teenager is believed to have a hand injury.They were discharged on Thursday morning. An 11-year-old boy was uninjured, police said.Det Supt Marchesini said they were still waiting to interview the mother about blaze.\\xa0'We have been unable to speak with the woman at this stage,'\\xa0he said.\\xa0 The home of Ellouisa Brighton Gibson, 36, (pictured) and partner Justin Gibson, 34, in Harristown, 130km west of Brisbane, erupted up in flames just after midnight on Wednesday 'That is something our investigators are working on with the hospital to arrange, but will happen dependent on her condition, how that progresses.'We're continually getting updates from the hospital at this stage - it's very difficult to ascertain.\\xa0We know she will have been hospital for an extensive period of time.\\xa0'We're just waiting on further confirmation of the hospital, and we'll be in contact with them quite regularly through the days.'He added: 'From what we've been advised at this point in time, she is in a critical condition, so has survived obviously last night and is expected to survive.\\xa0'But things can change quite quickly.Obviously we're hoping that she does, and that's not wanting to just be able to speak with her, but in terms of her surviving this incident.'Detective Inspector Renee Garske confirmed investigations would include whether domestic violence had played a role in the fire.Neighbours smashed windows in an attempt to free the children from the home.Neighbour Will Cuffe ran to help the family as soon as he saw the fire.‘We were awake and heard some loud shouting, so we went to see what was happening and saw a lot of people out on the street,’ he told The Courier Mail. Queensland Police confirmed it is treating the fire as suspicious ‘We heard the smoke alarms, then saw the smoke and flames. After we saw the smoke, it took about three minutes and the house just went up in flames‘We saw the mother, the father and some of the young kids. The mother was holding the kids and taking them to the ambulance.‘Two of the young kids were walking, but they were really badly burnt.’ he said. ‘The dad had a cut on his arm.’A witness who phoned Triple-0 said the home was fully engulfed by the time he ended the call to emergency services.Queensland Fire and Rescue Service station manager Neil Goodman said fire crews located the nine-year-old's body near the front door.'Once (crews) could bring the fire under control sufficiently, just near the front door, they located one (deceased person),' Mr Goodman told 7News.The family’s dog survived the fire and was being cared for by a neighbour.Mr Goodman said firefighters were greeted with a 'wall of flame and heavy smoke' when they arrived at the scene as the fire mostly impacted the front of the home.'The guys had quite a difficult time making access and getting in to conduct a primary search,' Mr Goodman said.After speaking with a family member who was 'hysterical', Mr Goodman advised fire and rescue crews on where they might be able to find the missing child.'We're all fathers, we've all got children, so its always hard, it's a little bit harder when its sort of similar to your own situation,' Mr Goodman said.It took about 30 minutes for four fire crews to extinguish the fire.Anyone with information or relevant vision, including CCTV or dashcam footage, is

costs, which appeared to have brought the Wagatha legal battle to an end more than five years after the viral social media post at the heart of the dispute, had brought “closure for my family and I”.Mrs Vardy sued Mrs Rooney at the High Court over alleged “very serious harm to her reputation” as a result of the latter’s October 2019 post, which claimed Mrs Vardy’s Instagram account was responsible for leaking information about her to The Sun newspaper.After a seven-day trial, Mrs Justice Steyn ruled in Mrs Rooney’s favour in July 2022, finding it was “likely” that Mrs Vardy’s agent, Caroline Watt, had passed information to The Sun and that Mrs Vardy “knew of and condoned this behaviour” and had “actively” engaged.The two were then engaged in a battle over legal costs for almost three years, potentially culminating on Tuesday when a specialist costs court was told that Mrs Vardy had agreed to pay almost £1.2 million of Mrs Rooney’s legal costs, with a judge also ruling she must pay an additional £212,000.Mrs Rooney must also pay Mrs Vardy a total of £135,097.50 in costs under the terms of court orders from 2024, which will be set off against what Mrs Vardy must pay.Posting on social media on Wednesday evening, Mrs Rooney wrote: “The ruling yesterday in my favour finally brings this claim to an end, it’s a relief and brings closure for my family and I.“Throughout this long process, I am grateful that the judgments have consistently gone my way.“However, as I have always maintained, this claim did not need to be made or run for as long as it did.“The time and money should have been put to better use.“I want to thank my legal representative, management, friends and family for their guidance and constant support.“Thanks also to the public and many well-wishers who have been in touch with such kind messages.“This episode is not something that I ever wanted in my life.“However, I am thankful for the way my family and team have dealt with it.“We look forward to moving on with our lives.”The case began in October 2019, when Mrs Rooney publicly claimed Mrs Vardy’s account was the source behind three stories featuring fake details she had posted on her private Instagram profile – her travelling to Mexico for a “gender selection” procedure, her planning to return to TV, and the basement flooding at her home.Mrs Rooney wrote: “I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them.“It’s … Rebekah Vardy’s account.”The case first went to court in November 2020, with a judge finding that Mrs Rooney’s post “clearly identified” Mrs Vardy as being “guilty of the serious and consistent breach of trust”.', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT',

But de-extinction remains a dangerous fantasy.Credit...Photo Illustration by Chantal JahchanBy Brooke JarvisBrooke Jarvis is a contributing writer for the magazine who writes frequently about climate change.May 7, 2025“Over 10,000 years ago, a howl was lost to time.”So begins a recent promotional video by Colossal Biosciences, a biotechnology company, whose narrator speaks in a voice that sounds as if it, too, was resurrected from the past: a 1950s newsreel or biology-class explainer. Quick cuts of scientific B-roll — frozen blood in vials, a microscope, a white-coated hand jiggling a computer joystick — eventually give way to a lingering close-up of a wolf opening a bright, golden eye. “Today,” the voice intones, “it returns.”The video introduces viewers to Romulus and Remus, “the first two dire wolves since the Pleistocene era.” In under three minutes, the very cute pups mature from tiny fluff balls, stumbling through their first steps, to regal youngsters romping in drifts of snow that accentuate their own (luxurious) white coats. “Roughhousing may look like play,” the narrator tells us, “but it’s serious practice for life in the pack.” The voice then shows a third, younger pup, Khaleesi — “the first female dire wolf brought back from extinction.”Colossal brands itself “the de-extinction company” and has announced plans to bring back woolly mammoths and dodos and Tasmanian tigers, some of the biggest stars in the species extermination hall of fame. On a planet with as many as one million species at risk of disappearing, many within decades, the company is promising an undo button.Many media outlets, including People and CNN, breathlessly promoted Colossal’s story; Time featured a cover portrait of Remus with a big red line through the word “extinct.” On my Facebook feed, clickbait link aggregators trumpeted “the world’s first de-extinction” in posts that were awe-struck and joyful. Any commenter who questioned the company’s narrative was shouted down as a hater. Amid the relentlessly grim news about the state of our planet, here was a tale of pure inspiration, of futuristic science triumphing over the tragic losses of a mythic past.De-extinction is a distinctly modern fantasy: the extremely appealing idea that we can, with just some pipettes and computers, undo the destruction we continue to cause the natural world. So it’s fitting that the first animal whose creation Colossal announced was a dire wolf — an animal that exists, in the public imagination, primarily as a fantasy. Colossal’s advisers include the “Game of Thrones” author George R.R. Martin and two stars of the HBO adaptation, and a press photo showed the animals sitting on the show’s Iron Throne. Many commenters were shocked not by the advancing science of genetic engineering but rather by the revelation that dire wolves were once real animals.Dire wolves thrived in the Americas for more than 200,000 years, adeptly filling so many ecological niches that their remains have been found from Alaska to Peru. More than 4,000 wolves were pulled from the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles alone. They are understood to have been hunters of the many large mammals that populated the Americas before the arrival of humans dramatically changed the continents’ ecology. They then disappeared alongside their prey, among the earliest victims of what would become an ongoing crisis of human-driven extinction.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

And that\\'s if warming continues under current policies to reach 4.9 degrees Fahrenheit (2.7 degrees Celsius) by 2100.If the world warms even faster, reaching 6.5 F (3.5\\u2009C) by 2100, 92% of today\\'s 5-year-olds will experience deadly heatwaves, 29% crop failures and 14% floods at some point in their lives.In comparison, the researchers found 16% of those born in 1960 experienced extreme heatwaves in their lifetimes. The researchers published their findings today (May 7) in the journal Nature.\"By stabilizing our climate around 1.5 C [2.7 F] above pre-industrial temperatures, about half of today\\'s young people will be exposed to an unprecedented number of heatwaves in their lifetime. Under a 3.5 C [6.5 F] scenario, over 90% will endure such exposure throughout their lives,\" study lead author Luke Grant, a physical scientist at the Canadian Centre for Climate Modeling and Analysis, said in a statement.\"The same picture emerges for other climate extremes examined, though with slightly lower affected fractions of the population. Yet the same unfair generational differences in unprecedented exposure is observed,\" he added.Eco-anxiety is rife among children, with nearly 4 in 5 children aged under 12 worried about climate change, according to a YouGov poll commissioned by Greenpeace.The effects of climate breakdown, and the human suffering it causes, are already evident — unprecedented heatwaves, storms, droughts, floods, extinctions and wildfires are taking place around the world.Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Related: Atlantic ocean currents are weakening — and it could make the climate in some regions unrecognizableBut quantifying the hardships that changes to Earth\\'s complex climactic systems will foist on future generations remains difficult. To arrive at a rough picture, the researchers behind the new study combed through demographic data for each location on the planet, combining population projections and life expectancies with climate model projections for three emissions scenarios.In February 2023, wildfires fueled by severe drought consumed forests, grasslands and wetlands in northeastern Argentina, burning an estimated 40% of the Ibera National Park. (Image credit: Joaquin Meabe/Getty Images)This enabled the researchers to arrive at rough estimates for the number of people in each generation who will experience unprecedented climate events. And the results they arrived at were stark — 52% of children born in 2020 face unprecedented heat exposure compared to 16% of those born in 1960 under the most limited global warming scenario of 2.7 F (1.5°C) by 2100, rising to 92% if warming reaches 6.5 F (3.5 °C).Exposures to crop failures, wildfires, droughts, floods and cyclones also rose significantly. For example, in a 6.5 F (3.5 °C) pathway 29% of those born in 2020 will face unprecedented lifetime exposure to crop failures, with the risk expanding for those around the United States, South America, Sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia.And those most socioeconomically vulnerable, especially children born around the tropics, are set to be the most strongly impacted. Under current policies, 92% of today’s five year olds born into low-income groups are exposed to lifetime risk compared to 79% of those from wealthier backgrounds.\"Living an unprecedented life means that without climate change, one would have less than a 1-in-10,000 chance of experiencing that many climate extremes across one\\'s lifetime,\" Grant said. \"This is a stringent threshold that identifies populations facing climate extremes far beyond what could be expected without man-made climate change.\"RELATED STORIESThe researchers note that their study is far from complete — they didn’t model climate change’s impacts on fertility, mortality or migration. This means that the effects of climate change in sparking mass migrations and resource wars were not accounted for in their analysis, and neither were the various tipping points our warming world is edging closer toward.In an accompanying News & Views article, Rosanna Gualdi and Raya Muttarak, from the Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Bologna, Italy, wrote that the findings \"reveal an alarming intergenerational gap\" in exposure to climate extremes.\"If greenhouse gases continue to be emitted into the atmosphere at current rates, global warming will intensify and today\\'s children will be exposed to increasingly frequent and severe climate-related hazards,\" they wrote.\"The actions taken today to reduce emissions are therefore crucial in shaping the climate future of current and coming generations. Given that the impacts of climate change and the transformations required to decarbonize society are not distributed equally, it is important to consider equity in the transition to net-zero emissions. This includes addressing the intergenerational inequality highlighted by Grant et al.

I mean this literally, as Leo J. Wahl is credited with inventing the modern hair clippers. The Wahl Professional 5 Star Cordless Senior Clipper keeps this legacy alive, which is why it’s a favorite among barbers. Chulpayev loves its unmatched power and durability, estimating that the clipper can handle around 50,000 total haircuts and last barbers at least five years. He also praises its ergonomic design for precise handling. Cassondra Kurtz, barber and founder of Beyond the Beard in New York City, also relies on the Senior Clipper for clients. This high-performance tool runs at 7,000 rpm, includes tough, long-lasting guards, offers an 80-minute cordless runtime, and can switch to corded use when needed. I’ve been using my Senior Clipper for over a year, and it’s clear why so many pros back it. The 7,000 rpm motor is no joke, plowing through hair with ease. I rarely, if ever, find myself going over one area multiple times. Plus, the adjustable taper is easy to use without sacrificing any stability (a common nuisance with clippers), so it’s perfect for any kind of fade, and you don’t have to worry about accidentally changing the length. The stainless steel blades never tug at hair and glide across your dome. A few months ago, I used these clippers to fully buzz my head, and the entire process couldn’t have taken more than ten minutes. That’s how powerful and precise these are. These are professional-grade clippers, so there are a few drawbacks for newbies. At 13 oz, the Senior is heavier than other options. Another killer Wahl device, the Magic Clip, is over 2 oz lighter, for example. DIY haircuts involve a lot of twisting and contorting your body to reach the sides and back of your head, so an extra couple of pounds will be felt. Similarly, if you’re new to cutting hair at home, these might prove too powerful and result in a more drastic cut than you were aiming for. But once you get the hang of using clippers, you won’t find a more reliable, effective option.Read More: Best Clippers for Men Battery Life80 minutesMotor Power7,000 rpmBladesStainless SteelAttachments4Most Versatile Cordless Hair Clipper Wahl Professional 5 Star Magic Clip ProsCan be used corded or cordlessGreat at beard trimmingLong lifespanSharp metal bladesComfortable to use designConsNot waterproofCharger isn't universe beyond Wahl productsIf you dig a fade, pay attention to the taper level on your cordless clipper. This lever actively adjusts the blade's cutting length between guide comb settings, allowing you to fine-tune the cut and achieve more precise fades. For the best available, look to Wahl’s Magic Clip, as its taper is even more user-friendly than the Senior. The lever not only switches between blade lengths more smoothly, but the feel of it (backed by its overall lighter design) is more comfortable and intuitive. Kurtz uses Wahl Professional 5 Star Cordless Senior on her clients, but recommends the Magic Clip for anyone new to cutting hair. This is due to the expansive dexterity and directional abilities the lightweight Magic Clip offers. Heavier clippers are going to be much more difficult to swing around your head, especially if you’re not very flexible, like me. They are also equipped with a consistently powerful battery that can operate for up to 100 minutes of runtime per charge. The high-power and high-speed motor also makes it versatile for a slew of hair types and styles. Plus, the blades are coated to keep them cooler for longer, and come with eight blade guard attachments for any hair length.Read More: Wahl Magic Clip Review Battery Life100 minutesMotor Power6,500 rpmBladesStainless SteelAttachments8Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowBest Cordless Hair Clipper DesignBaBylissPro BaBylissPRO GoldFX+ ProsBeautiful designStrong motorCan be used corded or cordless Three-hour battery ConsOver $225Chulpayev loves the BabylissPro for one major reason: its rpm. This clipper slices up to 13,600 slices per minute, and 6,800 rpm. Sure, the BaBylissPro GoldFX+ cordless hair clippers’ quality holds merit with its powerful motor and high-torque engine, but it also impresses with its sharp design. It has the vibe of a vintage ribbon microphone that Elvis would have used, but upside down, and gold. I’ll admit, I always feel a bit fancy whenever I hold this glittery clipper (despite chaotically cutting my own hair in a tiny bathroom). The battery life is also top of the market at three hours (though it’s more accurately 2 hours and 50 minutes), so I rarely have to charge it. I understand that dropping over $200 is a lot for something many people look to as a way to save money, but if you can swing it, these clippers will pay for themselves after a few uses.

There are swappable clipper and trimmer blades, a digital taper adjustment for razor-sharp precision, and magnetic snap-on guards for quick length changes. The full package is built for smooth, efficient cutting.While Bevel designed this tool with textured and curly hair in mind, it works on all hair types. I have straight hair, and this is my go-to when I’m giving myself a short cut, as it gets closer than any other clipper I’ve tried. Much of this is due to the digital taper, which unlike other traditional options, is controlled through an LED display, so that you always know exactly how closer you’re cutting. This results in a precise cut that’s easy to replicate once you find the taper levels you prefer. It also packs a standout four-hour battery life, which is far beyond any others on this list, and features a smart LED display so you’ll never run out of power mid-cut. It’s the ideal tool for fades and short hair styles, like buzzes or crew cuts.Battery Life4 hoursMotor Power6,000 rpmBladesStainless SteelAttachments4Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowBest Luxury Cordless Hair ClippersAndis Master Cordless Clipper 12470 Now 23% OffProsDurable aluminum housing Long lasting 2 hours batterySharp bladesIncludes standConsNo attachmentsLoud motorThe Andis Master Cordless Clipper runs at a powerful 7,200 strokes per minute with a rotary motor and a carbon-steel blade built for ultra-precise cuts.

I find it lasts more like 110 to 115 minutes. Still, it’s surprisingly lightweight for its power. The motor does get loud, especially during longer sessions.

It’s for the average dude who doesn’t want or have the space for multiple devices to achieve their grooming goals.The set comes with 21 pieces to tackle head hair, beards, body hair, and nose hair with interchangeable self-sharpening blades. Best of all, the battery lasts up to 6 hours. While it cannot operate with the cord, it does have a 5-minute quick charge.It won’t give you the most detailed cut, but if you’re just buzzing or doing a simple style, it can certainly handle that.

Chulpayev adds that corded hair clippers also tend to last longer. “If you took the corded machines that were made 30 or 20 years ago, you see some barbers that still use them,” he says. However, cordless devices like the Magic Clip, will only last about four or five years before performance starts to drop off. The benefits of cordless hair clippers are the convenience and flexibility of clipping your hair without dangling cables that restrict your movement. Cordless hair clippers also make for a better on-the-go option. “From a travel point of view, a personal point of view, and from a dexterity point of use, a cordless hair clipper is the way to go,” Kurtz says. While corded hair clippers offer abbreviated power, the best cordless hair clippers also offer consistent power for prolonged periods of time. Ultimately, like most grooming tools, it comes down to a split between preference and quality products. Meet the ExpertsDaniel Chulpayev, barber and founder of Made Man Barbershop in New York City.

That question is being hotly debated in Catholic forums, as millions of dollars pour into betting pools during an intensifying papal conclave.As digital wagering expands across the United States—once mainly focused on sports and casinos—betting platforms have broadened their reach to include the ongoing papal election. Picking the next Pope has become big business. Like, really big.Millions Riding on the Next PontiffWhile the College of Cardinals meets in secret behind Vatican walls to choose a new leader for 1.3 billion Catholics, punters around the globe are placing serious money on the outcome.Polymarket, a digital currency betting site, is handling over £13.47 million ($18 million) in wagers tied to the conclave. Meanwhile, Kalshi is managing close to £5.01 million ($6.7 million), according to the Wall Street Journal.Favourites and Long ShotsOn Polymarket, frontrunner Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's Secretary of State, leads with a 27% chance of selection. Close behind is Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle from the Philippines, holding a 22% likelihood.Other contenders include Cardinals Matteo Zuppi (11%), Pierbattista Pizzaballa (10%), and Peter Erdo (7%). On these platforms, users can 'buy' a candidate, effectively betting on their election as Pope, or 'sell' them—betting against their selection.Tagle's potential win has drawn over £0.97 million ($1.3 million) in bets, the same amount as Dutch Cardinal Willem 'Wim' Eijk, despite his 1% odds. Parolin, Cardinal Peter Turkson, and Cardinal Robert Sarah have each seen over £0.75 million ($1 million) wagered on their candidacies.Why Papal Elections Are So UnpredictableThe conclave's secrecy and lack of campaigning make betting on its outcome uniquely uncertain.Tom Nash, a contributing apologist for Catholic Answers, told Catholic News Agency: 'The most well-known cardinals are heading into the conclave,' but visibility doesn't always reflect actual chances of election.Nash noted that Cardinal Angelo Scola was widely tipped to win in 2013 but failed to secure the two-thirds majority. Instead, the Cardinals chose Jorge Bergoglio, who became Pope Francis.Even pre-conclave meetings are held privately, meaning the public has limited insight into real frontrunners.Strict Rules Inside the ConclaveThe 1996 apostolic constitution Universi Dominici Gregis forbids Cardinals from communicating outside the Vatican during the conclave. It also bans newspapers, radio, and TV access.The document explicitly outlaws any 'pact, agreement, promise, or other commitment' aimed at influencing the vote. However, it does permit open discussions and opinion sharing before and during deliberations.Morality of Betting on the Holy SeeSome Catholics have raised ethical concerns about gambling on such a solemn event. While once banned, betting on papal elections is no longer explicitly prohibited by Church law.In 1591, Pope Gregory XIV outlawed such betting under threat of excommunication. But the 1918 revision of canon law omitted the rule, and no ban has since been reinstated.Still, Nash cautioned: 'Catholics should prayerfully consider how we can best give witness regarding this 2025 conclave... betting could introduce [corruption] into the conclave.'He added: 'We don't want to reduce this important event to the level of a mere sports competition.'What the Church Says About GamblingThe Catechism of the Catholic Church does not condemn betting outright. Wagering is only deemed morally wrong when it involves money needed for essential expenses or becomes addictive.If you're gambling away rent money or falling into a cycle of dependency, the Church calls that 'enslavement'—a clear moral red flag.In short: placing a few pounds on your favourite cardinal isn't a sin.

That is, unless their thinking has been muddled by ingesting microplastics. Then, they struggle with a decision that could be crucial for survival. They aren’t alone: across the animal kingdom, it appears, tiny bits of plastic change behaviours and mess up cognition. Exposure to these particles makes mice more forgetful and less social. Bees have trouble learning. Zebrafish act more anxious.\\nSuch discoveries sound a warning bell for people, too. These so-called microplastic fragments are everywhere, from Arctic snow to the Amazon rainforest. Perhaps worse, they are in our foods: from beer and table salt to seafood and honey. “If you turn the top of your plastic bottle, you shower tiny pieces of plastic down into the water,” says Tamara Galloway, an ecotoxicologist at the University of Exeter, UK, whose work focuses on the environmental and health effects of pollultants like microplastics. People consume around 52,000 microplastic particles per year – or around 121,000 if you include those we inhale. What’s more, recent research shows that some of these can cross the barrier designed to stop toxins from getting from blood vessels into brain tissues.\\nExactly if and how this might mess with our minds is unclear because we can’t subject people to the sorts of experiments we do with the likes of mice – though Galloway’s opinion is that the effects on humans could be serious.\\nWe do however, have animal studies to illuminate how microplastics affect the brain…', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Microplastics linked to cognitive issues in animals\\nENTITIES: Marta Zaraska, Tamara Galloway, University of Exeter\\nEVENT: Animal studies show microplastics impair cognition and alter behavior in hermit crabs, mice, bees, and zebrafish; microplastics can cross the blood-brain barrier.\\nCONTEXT: Microplastics impact animal cognition, raising concerns for humans.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 47795, 'sourceId': 918, 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/may/07/queen-elizabeth-ii-memorial-designs-unveiled-statues-bridges-soundscapes', 'title': 'Statues, bridges, soundscapes: Queen Elizabeth II memorial designs unveiled', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T14:33:53.000Z', 'content': 'How best to capture the enduring essence of Queen Elizabeth II is the question behind innovative designs shortlisted for a national memorial planned for Britain’s longest-serving monarch.An exact cast of a Windsor oak tree, a giant canopy of stone lilies and a “graceful and strong” stone bridge symbolising her as the bedrock of the nation are among shortlisted designs on which the public is now being consulted.Other ideas include a statue of the late queen next to Prince Philip, an audio installation featuring her voice, and a “tranquil family” of romantic royal gardens inspired by the Georgian architect John Nash.The memorial is planned for St James’s Park, close to Buckingham Palace in the heart of London.

Firstly, there’s way more to do in bed than anal intercourse. Jerking off together, frotting, oral, making out, kink, and toys are all there at your disposal. You could, for example, acquire a double-ended dildo and experience the same kind of anal stimulation at the same time.\\nIf you simply need to integrate penis-in-ass anal play, you could enlist a third (or more) guy to do one/both of you. At first, it may make more sense to do this together, but of course, you could keep things open and both take partners separately. The writer Edmund White once told me that as a bottom, he tends to fall in love with other bottoms, and the way he’s always negotiated that is non-monogamy. An open relationship can function like the best of both worlds: You get the stability of a partner and the novelty of a swinging single. One person can’t be everything to you, no matter how perfect he is, so there’s a real pragmatism in keeping things open. It, of course, comes with its own complications like insecurity, jealousy, increased risk of infection, and time management, but if you stay on the same page with regular, clear communication and defer to the most sensitive person in the couple, you can do well and be extremely satisfied sexually.\\nFinally, I suggest thinking outside of your currently assumed identities. I know some people are just bottoms and that’s all they’re ever going to be sexually, but for many, those roles are a bit more malleable, subject to change with time and circumstance. Versatility is extremely common. If either of you has ever had an interest in topping, well, now is the time to try it. If it never goes there, you still have a lot of options.\\nPlease keep questions short (<150 words), and don‘t submit the same question to multiple columns.

In the event of something egregious—a wine glass shattered on a carpet, an accidental condom spillage across the wall—of course, the person responsible should try to rectify it as best they can (elbow grease, money to fix/clean/replace, both, etc.). But in terms of regular wear and tear from bodies being in a space doing what they’re there to do? Nah. That’s your job. Hosting includes prep and cleanup. You take on these responsibilities implicitly when you invite people into your home.\\nThat’s not to say that you’re being unreasonable. Of course, it would be nice if people lent a hand. Very considerate guests will at least offer to, say, do the dishes after you’ve cooked for them or stick around and help you pick up. But this is them going above and beyond—their job is to attend, and yours is to provide. It would not be outrageous if, in your invite, you mentioned, “Try to remain considerate. A helping hand from attendees in putting things back in order would be much appreciated.” Then maybe more people would be aware and make the effort. But they are not obligated to do so. That responsibility falls squarely on your shoulders. If you don’t like it, don’t throw a party. Generosity is, by definition, thankless—the gratitude you receive for your hospitality is a bonus, not part of the price of admission.\\nSend Us Your Questions About the Workplace!\\nThe columnists behind our new advice column,\\xa0Good Job, want to help you navigate your social dynamics at work. Does your colleague constantly bug you after hours? Has an ill-advised work romance gone awry?\\xa0Ask us your question here!\\nDear How to Do It,\\nMy girlfriend keeps complaining that I’m not performing oral sex on her properly because it takes her forever to reach orgasm. I’ve done this with previous girlfriends and never had any negative reactions. She orgasms pretty much every time we have sex, so she isn’t one of those women who has a difficult time coming.\\xa0Am I the one who has the problem, or is it her?\\n—First Time I’ve Heard This\\nDear First Time I’ve Heard This,\\nThe best way to think about this isn’t as a you problem or a her problem, but as a problem you both share. The licks ain’t licking, but whether that is your “fault” for not doing it right or her “fault” for not responding to supposedly objectively good head is immaterial—you should collaborate on a way to efficiently achieve your shared goal of her orgasm.\\nNow, I don’t think you should take your adeptness as a given. You say you hadn’t heard negative reactions about your performance from exes, but that only means that you didn’t hear the negative reactions, not that they didn’t exist. Positive reactions, too, may have been faked for any number of reasons (a glaring one: to get you to hurry up and be done). Your head game may have been very good indeed to the women that came before your current girlfriend, but I want to disabuse you of the notion that you’re intrinsically good at something when it may well not be the case and also is irrelevant if you aren’t good to the person that you are with. Everyone has different preferences, after all.\\nIt is unfortunate that your girlfriend seemingly hasn’t given you much direction. Complaining isn’t constructive. If your techniques are not suited to her taste, it would be useful for you to know what is. If you haven’t had this conversation, you should. Ask her what she likes and whether or not she can direct you in the moment. There is no all-purpose approach to prescribe to women’s genitalia. Bodies are idiosyncratic and each needs to be approached with stimulation catered to it—stimulation that in fact may need to change during the act. As Ian Kerner writes in She Comes First: The Thinking Man’s Guide to Pleasuring a Woman (a book that I recommend you and your girlfriend read and discuss together), “Cunnilingus is not foreplay, it’s coreplay—the best approach for consistently applying various methods of clitoral stimulation—and one that, like genital penetration, requires an appropriate prologue of erotic activity.”\\nKerner gives a lot of hands-on (or is that tongues-on?) advice in his book. The 69 position, he postulates, is not ideal because it provides “stimulation from the wrong point of attack,” which is to say: “Rather than approaching her vulva from the south—bottom up—you’re coming in from the north—top down. Regardless of who’s on top, you’ll have little use of your hands and it will be difficult to use your tongue to comfortably service the major parts of her clitoris.” For something that has proven effective, Kerner recommends diagonal tongue strokes (again, approaching from the south). Tilt your head so that one of your ears is pressing up against her inner thigh and lick from the lower point of the clit up to its diagonal opposite brushing against the head in the process, and then make slow strokes down. This is just one technique and tempo recommended—others may be more useful. You’ll have to try different things to see what works on your girlfriend’s body.

Earlier this year, the US government designated several crime factions as terrorist organizations, including Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua and El Salvador’s MS-13, as well as Mexican cartels and Haitian gangs.“We don’t have terrorist organizations here, we have criminal organizations that have infiltrated society,” said Sarrubo. But Brazilian law, he added, only considers organizations that violently clash with the government for religious or racial reasons to be terrorists.In recent weeks, the Trump administration has deported hundreds of Latin American immigrants, alleging they were gang members, though it presented little evidence of their criminal ties.At the meeting in Brasília, US officials informed their Brazilian counterparts that their request was part of an effort to address immigration and criminal gangs with a transnational presence, saying they were priorities for the Trump administration, said one source who was present.US officials said a terrorist designation could help the government apply sanctions, raise resources and target criminal supply chains, the same source added.According to this source, US officials said the FBI had reported that the PCC and the Comando Vermelho had cells in 12 US states, mainly Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Florida, Connecticut and Tennessee.Those reports, the source added, alleged that the gangs trafficked guns and laundered money through Brazilians who traveled to the US, adding that 113 people were denied visas to enter the country because of connections to organized crime in 2024 alone.On Monday, the office of Senator Flavio Bolsonaro, son of the former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, said he met with Trump Organization officials to deliver a dossier that he said included intelligence information that tied the PCC and the CV to terrorist acts.The US embassy in Brasília did not immediately reply to a request for comment.', 'location': 'BRA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Brazil rejects US request on gang designation\\nENTITIES: Brazil, US, Primeiro Comando da Capital, Comando Vermelho, Trump administration\\nEVENT: Brazil rejected a US request to designate PCC and CV gangs as terrorist organizations, citing Brazilian law.\\nCONTEXT: US wants Brazil to designate gangs as terrorists for sanctions.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 46930, 'sourceId': 883, 'url': 'https://news.sky.com/story/donald-trump-hails-uk-trade-deal-as-pm-agrees-concessions-on-food-and-agriculture-13363630', 'title': 'Donald Trump hails UK trade deal - as PM agrees concessions on food and agriculture', 'publishDate': '2025-05-08T02:00:00.000Z', 'content': 'Donald Trump has hailed the trade deal with the UK as \"full and comprehensive\" as he promised it would cement the relationship between the two countries for \"years to come\".The US president said it was a \"great honour\" to strike an agreement with the UK and said deals with other countries would soon follow.\\nPosting on the Truth Social website, Mr Trump said: \"The agreement with the United Kingdom is a full and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come.\"Because of our long time history and allegiance together, it is a great honour to have the United Kingdom as our FIRST announcement.

\"liberation day\" tariffs on both the US\\' geopolitical rivals and allies on 2 April.Mr Trump imposed a 10% tariff on most countries including the UK during the announcement, along with higher \"reciprocal\" tariff rates for many trading partners.However, those reciprocal tariffs were later suspended for 90 days.Britain was not among the countries hit with the higher reciprocal tariffs because it imports more from the US than it exports there.However, the UK was still impacted by a 25% tariff on all cars and all steel and aluminium imports to the US.A UK official said on Tuesday that the two countries had made good progress on a trade deal that would likely include lower tariff quotas on steel and cars.Read more:UK chancellor outlines red lines for US trade dealWill MPs get a

politically helpful for Keir Starmer to have got the heads of terms, the kind of main points of a US-UK trade deal, nailed down before we see what we have negotiated with the EU -- or, more importantly, Donald Trump sees what we have negotiated with the EU.\"Coates said there was \"always a danger\" that if it happened the other way around, Mr Trump would \"take umbrage\" at negotiations

This approach eliminates any added layers of software-based security – something the global telecom industry has struggled to achieve for years.\\nThe breakthrough – developed by Professor Lilin Yi at Shanghai Jiao Tong University – is called the Integrated Encryption and Communication (IEAC) system. Unlike traditional methods such as TLS or IPsec, which apply software-level security while leaving the optical signal exposed, IEAC redefines how security operates within fiber networks. Rather than securing the message, it encrypts the signal itself – the light – making eavesdropping virtually impossible.\\nIt achieves this using an optimized artificial intelligence technique called geometric constellation shaping (GCS). High-speed random number generators create a unique light pattern for each data burst. The system treats every transmission like a constantly shifting optical fingerprint. As a result, the signal becomes nearly impossible to decode without the exact matching pattern. To any interceptor, the data appears indistinguishable from static.\\nIn testing, the researchers passed the signal through a fiber loop, simulating conditions such as dispersion, nonlinearities, and optical noise. They tested it across 26 channels on the full 3.9 THz C-band, each carrying dual-polarization 32 GBd signals. The result was a net data rate of 1 Tbps and a bit error rate under 2×10⁻² – commercial-grade speed paired with near-military-grade security.\\nBeyond its blistering data rates, another compelling aspect of IEAC is its compatibility with existing infrastructure. Unlike quantum key distribution (QKD) or chaotic encryption systems that require specialized equipment, IEAC can piggyback on standard optical hardware. In many cases, deploying the system could be as simple as a firmware upgrade. This compatibility should provide a significant advantage for cash-strapped operators or countries seeking to secure national communications without overhauling their entire network.\\n\"Our work bridges the gap between security and transmission performance in optical communications,\" Yi said. \"By embedding encryption into the physical layer, IEAC paves the way for secure, high-throughput networks capable of supporting AI-driven data demands.\"\\nProfessor Yi and his team hope the IEAC framework\\'s scalability and compatibility with today\\'s optical infrastructure will make it a game changer for global data centers, cloud platforms, and upcoming 6G networks.', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: 1 Tbps secure data transmission achieved\\nENTITIES: Lilin Yi, Shanghai Jiao Tong University\\nEVENT: Chinese researchers achieved 1 Tbps secure data transmission over 1,200 km of optical fiber using Integrated Encryption and Communication (IEAC) system.\\nCONTEXT: IEAC is compatible with existing infrastructure, potentially deployable via firmware upgrade.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 48311, 'sourceId': 927, 'url': 'https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/locals-gather-red-wine-spritz-conclave-watch-cardinals-121585677', 'title': \"Locals gather for red wine spritz and conclave watch in a cardinal's hometown\", 'publishDate': '2025-05-08T06:14:30.000Z', 'content': 'SCHIAVON, Italy -- SCHIAVON, Italy (AP) — Conclave watching turned out to be a perfect aperitivo activity.Caffè Centrale, on the main drag of the Veneto hometown of Cardinal Pietro Parolin, a papal favorite, filled up with locals and journalists awaiting the first sign of smoke on Wednesday.A large TV screen displayed images from St. Peter’s Square and the chimney atop the Sistine Chapel, where 133 cardinals were casting the first votes for pope, as locals in the Veneto town of Schiavon, near Vicenza, quaffed glasses of wine.“We’re waiting, and we’re rooting for him,’’ said Giacomo Bonora, raising a glass of the local favorite, a red wine spritz, and using the local nickname for Parolin, “Don Piero.\" Bonora said that when Parolin returns to the town of 2,600, he asks to be called “Don Piero,\" the way a parish priest would be addressed, using the Veneto dialect for Pietro, rather than “eminence,\\'\\' a cardinal\\'s honorific.Parolin, 70, is a veteran diplomat who was Francis’ secretary of state, essentially the Holy See’s prime minister and No. 2 to the pope.Outside, a city worker stopped to show the parish sacristan a photo of Parolin when the town celebrated his elevation to secretary of state 12 years ago. Everyone is hopeful, but officials have been instructed not to speak to the media until a new pope is elected.Angelo Cisalto, the sacristan at the town\\'s St. Margherita parish church, was heading home to keep an eye on the smoke coming out of the chimney.If it is white, it is his job to go and ring the church bells. Cisalto, 84, remembers Parolin as a child, 14 years his junior, and always devout. “He used to dress up as an altar boy, and at home, in his garage, he had a little altar,’’ where he would play saying Mass, Cisalto recalled. “He is a very good, very humble person.\"Back at Caffè Centrale, clients ordered plates of cold cuts as the closed meeting of cardinals dragged on long past the expected hour. TV reporters whose air times had passed headed out for the night. Finally, black smoke emerged.“Tomorrow, we\\'ll do it again,” Bonora said. Locals recalled that Parolin came regularly to Schiavon before his mother died last summer. His father died when he was 10, and he entered the seminary in nearby Vicenza at 14.

The president has historically respected the independence of the central bank, and kept out of its way – even if there was disagreement over policy.But, of course, it looks like Trump is following his own playbook.“Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Trump said on social media in April.The Fed chair first took office in 2018 after an appointment from Trump, and was later reappointed by Joe Biden in 2022. Though his term is expected to end in May 2026, multiple reports suggested that Trump was considering firing the chair before his term is up.Here’s what we know is going on between Trump and the Federal Reserve.What does the Federal Reserve do?As the central bank, the Fed manages the money supply in the US, primarily by setting the interest rate. When setting it, the Fed considers the inflation rate and the labor market, what it calls its “dual mandate”: higher interest rates could bring down inflation, but negatively affect the labor market, while lower interest rates could do the opposite.Over the last few years, starting before Trump’s second term, the central bank has been trying to bring down inflation, which peaked at 9% in June 2022.To do that, the Fed raised interest rates to a multi-decade high of between 5.25% and 5.5%. Just a few years before, at the height of the pandemic, in 2020 and 2021, interest rates had been close to zero. This made it cheaper to borrow money, including taking out mortgages.Late last year, the Fed lowered interest rates, which are now 4.25% to 4.5% – a whole point lower than where they were a year ago.US stock markets are very sensitive to Fed decisions. Stocks started to climb after September, when the Fed started cutting rates.Why is Trump attacking the Federal Reserve?Since Trump took office again, Fed officials held three meetings, in January, March and May, at which they could have changed interest rates. At all three, they declined to touch the rates, citing economic uncertainty.“Uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further,” the Fed said on Wednesday, as it held rates again. In a statement, it added that its committee of policymakers “judges that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen”.After Trump introduced his newest slate of tariffs, he said on social media that he expected Powell to cut interest rates. “This would be a PERFECT time” for rate cuts, Trump wrote on social media. “CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS.”From Trump’s perspective, cutting rates could offset the impact that his tariffs are having on the US stock market. But for Fed officials, it would risk exacerbating inflation.Powell – who is extremely careful with his public remarks – made some statements that made clear the Fed believes Trump’s tariffs will make prices go up, making it far less likely that the central bank would decrease rates.“Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well-anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem,” he said in Chicago recently.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionThis seemed to set Trump off. “If I want him out, he’ll be out of there real fast, believe me,” the president told reporters in the Oval Office. “I’m not happy with him.”Can Trump legally fire the Fed chair?The clearest answer: right now, probably not, but things could change.Powell has affirmed that the Fed’s independence “is a matter of law”.“We’re not removable except for cause,” Powell said. “Fed independence has pretty broad support across both political parties and on both sides of the hill.”But he also mentioned a case going through the supreme court that may alter the power the president has over federal agencies, stemming from Trump firing an official with the National Labor Relations Board. It is unclear how the court will rule, but it allowed the firings to stand, overruling a lower court.“I don’t think that that decision will apply to the Fed, but I don’t know,” Powell said. “It’s a situation that we’re monitoring carefully.”The Fed’s next board meeting is on 17 and 18 June. Trump is likely to continue pressuring the Fed ahead of this meeting, but officials are not expected to budge.What is the Fed’s case for independence from the White House?The Fed, which holds huge power over the economy, has to be extremely careful about each decision it makes.Moves made by the central bank can affect the stock market, the value of the US dollar and government bonds – which all, in turn, affect the US economy.On the Fed’s independence, Powell said that officials “will only make our decisions based on our best thinking, based on our best analysis of the data and what is the way to achieve our dual mandate goals as we can to best serve the American people”.“We will do what we do strictly without consideration of political or any other extraneous factors,” he said.', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Trump clashes with Fed over interest rates\\nENTITIES: Donald Trump, Jerome Powell, Federal Reserve, Joe Biden\\nEVENT: Trump criticizes Fed Chair Powell for not cutting interest rates, potentially offsetting tariff impacts, while Powell emphasizes Fed's independence and inflation control.\\nCONTEXT: Trump pressures Fed amid economic uncertainty and tariff concerns.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 47806, 'sourceId': 918, 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/07/minimum-age-train-drivers-lowered-to-18-great-britain', 'title': 'Minimum age for train drivers to be lowered to 18 in Great Britain', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T04:00:07.000Z', 'content': 'If train drivers – like police officers – start looking younger, it may not just be you. Britain’s trains could soon have 18-year-olds in the cab, with the government likely to cut the minimum age to plug a shortage of drivers.Currently train drivers can obtain a licence from the age of 20 – although the vast majority of drivers are much older.The Department for Transport said the change could lead to teenage applicants being recruited from December. The government hopes to boost job prospects for young people, with thousands of apprenticeships made available to school-leavers, as well as making train services more reliable.According to data from the rail regulator ORR, 87% of P-coded cancellations – those made the night before a service is scheduled to run – are caused by driver shortages. Services are also frequently disrupted because of a reliance on “rest day working” across parts of the industry where operators rely on drivers voluntarily undertaking additional shifts.Unions and the rail industry also hope the move will lead to a more diverse workforce at the controls. Drivers are typically white middle-aged men, with an average age of 48. Fewer than 9% of train drivers are female, while under 12% are from a minority ethnic background.The move is also partly prompted by a looming retirement crisis: about 25%-30% of approximately 27,000 drivers in Britain are due to reach the retirement age of 65 in the next five years.The DfT said the decision to lower the recruitment age now would bridge this gap, preventing any future shortages and ensuring consistent, reliable services for passengers.The move comes after a consultation launched by the previous government, and as ministers plan wider reform under a nationalised Great British Railways.Heidi Alexander said the move would unlock thousands of jobs. The transport secretary said: “We’re committed to getting the economy moving and a big part of that is getting young people into the workforce, putting them on track for a skilled and fulfilling career which will boost growth across the country.“We’re future-proofing our railways against delays and cancellations caused by a shortage of drivers, ensuring that we can provide reliable, passenger-focused train journeys under Great British Railways for decades to come.”skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionMick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, the train drivers’ union, said it had long been campaigning to lower the age at which drivers could start training. He said: “This decision – to allow people to leave school, or college, and join the railway in the driving grade at 18 rather than wait until they’re 20 – will increase diversity in the driver’s cab.“At the moment, young people who want to become train drivers leave school or college at 18, get other jobs, and we miss out as an industry as they don’t wait around until they turn 20 to find a career.”The DfT pointed out that several other countries, including the Netherlands, France, Germany and Switzerland, had already safely adopted a lower age limit.It typically takes about 12 months before a trainee can start driving trains.', 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Britain lowers train driver minimum age to 18\\nENTITIES: Department for Transport, ORR, Aslef, Great British Railways, Heidi Alexander, Mick Whelan\\nEVENT: Great Britain is likely to lower the minimum age for train drivers from 20 to 18 to address driver shortages and increase diversity, with potential recruitment starting in December.\\nCONTEXT: Lowering age aims to address driver shortages and diversify workforce.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 47998, 'sourceId': 9, 'url': 'https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250508-trump-to-announce-trade-deal-with-uk-on-thursday-us-media', 'title': 'Trump hails US-UK trade agreement but scope of deal is unclear', 'publishDate': '2025-05-08T04:15:16.000Z', 'content': 'US President Donald Trump announced Thursday an agreement with Britain on trade, which would be the first such deal since he launched his global tariffs blitz.Trump provided no details about the scope of the agreement, which comes a month after he imposed sweeping tariffs on US trading partners on his April 2 \"Liberation Day\".\"The agreement with the United Kingdom is a full and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come,\" the president posted on his Truth Social platform.\"Because of our long time history and allegiance together, it is a great honor to have the United Kingdom as our FIRST announcement.

This approach to tattooing isn\\'t uncommon, but in this case, the tattoo was botched and led to an unintended side effect.\\n(Image credit: Neuroplastic Creative via Getty Images)\\nThe patient: A 21-year-old man in IranThe symptoms: The patient reported that his penis had been \"partially rigid\" for three months.What happened next: Upon examining the man, doctors noted that he had a tattoo along the top of the penile shaft, as well as another tattoo on the glans, or tip of the penis. The man initially told the doctors he\\'d gotten the tattoos several years prior, but he later said he\\'d gotten them just before his symptoms emerged.The tattooist had used a handheld needle, the patient said, which is a common traditional tattooing technique. Afterward, the patient experienced bleeding and pain for a number of days. After the pain subsided, the man experienced \"longer-than-usual sleep-related erections,\" which worsened to the point that his penis was \"half-rigid\" all the time.His doctors further investigated his medical history and ran many lab tests, including brain scans to look for abnormalities and blood tests to rule out infections. Using sound waves to assess blood flow in the penis, the doctors saw \"pseudoaneurysms\" in the tattooed area, meaning there were places where the arteries had been injured, causing blood to pool.The diagnosis: The man was diagnosed with \"nonischemic priapism.\" Priapism refers to prolonged erections that occur in the absence of sexual stimulation, or that continue long after sexual stimulation has ceased.The most common form of priapism — ischemic priapism — occurs when a blockage prevents deoxygenated blood from exiting the penis, or when certain drugs prevent that blood flow. This can quickly lead to tissue damage, permanent scarring and impotence.Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.In nonischemic priapism, though, blood flow is not blocked, so there\\'s less pain and a low risk of permanent damage. This condition, also called \"high-flow priapism,\" typically occurs when an artery in the erectile tissue is injured and allows too much blood to be continuously pumped into the penis.The treatment: The appropriate treatment wasn\\'t available at the facility where the patient was examined, so he was referred to another facility for a superselective embolization, a procedure that would have blocked blood flow through the injured arteries to reduce blood flow in the penis. However, he instead underwent a \"nonindicated\" procedure that didn\\'t make sense given the features of his case. (In a report of the case, the man\\'s doctors didn\\'t note where or why he got this alternative operation.)The procedure involved introducing shunts, or passageways for blood, between two tissues: the corpus cavernosum and the corpus spongiosum. In ischemic priapism, blood builds up in the corpus cavernosum, so introducing these shunts helps the blood to drain properly. However, in nonischemic priapism, blood flow is not blocked, so that surgery wouldn\\'t help. \"Predictably, the procedure was unsuccessful,\" the man\\'s doctors wrote in the case report.Following the procedure, the man continued to experience half-rigid priapism. He was disappointed with the surgery\\'s outcome. But ultimately, the condition was painless and he maintained \"moderately good\" erectile function during intercourse. For those reasons, he declined further treatment and instead lives with the condition, his doctors reported.What makes the case unique: At the time the case was published, in 2012, the doctors wrote that it was the \"first case of nonischemic priapism following penile tattooing\" ever described in the medical literature.RELATED STORIESPriapism can have many triggers. For example, ischemic — or \"low-flow\" — priapism can be associated with sickle cell disease; blood cancers, such as leukemia; and the use of drugs, including certain antipsychotics, antidepressants and erectile-dysfunction medications. High-flow priapism accounts for only about 5% of priapism cases and is most often caused by physical trauma to the penis or the perineum, the tissue between the scrotum and anus.\"In our case, most probably, the handheld [tattoo] needle penetrated the penis too deep,\" the doctors wrote. \"Based on our unique case, we discourage penile tattooing.\"The patient, for his part, reported having no regret over the tattoo and no depression or other psychological symptoms related to the priapism.DisclaimerThis article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.\\nNicoletta Lanese is the health channel editor at Live Science and was previously a news editor and staff writer at the site.

Although it seems to have ignored the fact that many automakers tend to remove the physical buttons entirely, anyway.Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.As a result, LG thinks its expandable display, complete with protruding touch buttons, offers the best of both worlds that is \"easy to operate even while driving\".Alongside the Stretchable display, the South Korean tech giant is also showcasing the world’s largest pillar-to-pillar 57-inch automotive display, as well as an 18-inch Slidable OLED display that can be rolled up and hidden in a vehicle’s interior headliner.Analysis: One touch too many(Image credit: LG)While LG’s display technology is mightily impressive, looking like something hailing directly from an alien aircraft, it doesn’t really solve the issue of driver distraction when behind the wheel.The beauty of physical buttons is that they remain static, easy to locate and the sort of thing drivers can operate with muscle memory alone, negating the need to take eyes off the road.LG’s demonstration reveals that the unit has to be tapped a number of times before the physical buttons appear, often via very small and possibly quite fiddly parts of the screen.It’s almost like a futuristic BMW iDrive system, but with additional steps required to reveal the physical dials and buttons that made the German marque’s system so easy to use... although the new version has controversially dispatched of buttons.While a stretchable display might not be the best solution for drivers, it could be an ultra-luxurious system for those traveling in the rear – allowing designers the freedom to keep spaces looking clean and minimal, while offering a bit of drama when occupants decide they want to enjoy some Netflix on the 18-inch Slidable OLED display that’s tucked away in the roof.You might also likeMercedes\\' new steer-by-wire tech is the next big EV trend – and I\\'ll begrudgingly accept that it\\'s the futureI’ve tried the new Mercedes-Benz Superscreen – and its Google Gemini-powered smarts push EV infotainment to the next levelMove over, Rolls Royce – I tried the BMW i7\\'s 31-inch 8K Theater Screen and it\\'s the height of automotive luxury\\nLeon has been navigating a world where automotive and tech collide for almost 20 years, reporting on everything from in-car entertainment to robotised manufacturing plants.

Kimberly Hall is said to have tried to get Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to deport her to her native Britain after she was allegedly busted with $6.5 million of cocaine at Chicago O'Hare Airport Hall, pictured shortly after her August 2024 arrest, was on the verge of boarding a flight home to the UK to evade justice, prosecutors allege. She had been released from jail on an ankle tag just before the alleged escape attempt Hall, pictured in a newer mugshot, says she had been asking about how to get a job when she was taken into ICE custody But Hall was charged with two class X felonies - controlled substance trafficking and possession with intent to deliver.She was indicted by a grand jury in September 2024, with prosecutors asking for Hall to remain behind bars over fears she was a flight risk.A judge refused, instead ordering her to hand over her passport and don an ankle monitor so authorities could keep tabs her whereabouts.\\xa0Hall's attorney Carter claims the alleged drug mule had actually been detained by ICE while seeking information about finding a job in the United States.'The kiosk official saw the electronic monitoring device on Ms. Hall and assumed it was from ICE and instructed her to go to their office in the same building,' Carter's motion said.\\xa0\\xa0'When she spoke to an ICE official she was arrested and placed in custody.'\\xa0Carter even suggested the 'wildly unpredictable' Trump administration was to blame for the drama amid an ongoing crackdown on migrants.\\xa0He suggested ICE agents had overreacted to an honest enquiry about finding work, which prosecutors have now interpreted as a bid to flee.Carter wants Hall released from jail again and a hearing to determine whether she should remain behind bars has been scheduled for May 16.\\xa0 Hall was nabbed after arriving at Chicago O'Hare (pictured) on a connecting flight in August 2024 She claims she was asked to carry a bag containing what she believed to be $250,000 in cash from Cancun in Mexico to Manchester in England Hall, speaking while on house arrest, says she had been offered a freebie trip to Mexico while on vacation to Portugal and accepted the offer because she needed 'a bit of breathing space' Hall said last year: 'I am not guilty of what they're saying I am.'She said she was enjoying a leisure trip to Portugal when she was offered a free trip to Mexico by two men who asked her to bring a case full of cash to the UK.Hall said she'd accepted the trip because she needed 'a bit of breathing space' and claimed the two men she met 'certainly didn't come across as being criminals.'\\xa0Hall was initially freed on house arrest and was only allowed to leave the property where she was staying for two days a week. Its location has not been disclosed and it is unclear if Hall has to pay for her accommodation.\\xa0\\xa0She faces 60 years behind bars if convicted of the charges she faces.\", 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Beautician's alleged drug smuggling escape plot fails\\nENTITIES: Kimberly Hall, ICE, Chicago O'Hare Airport, UK, Cook County Prosecutors\\nEVENT: Kimberly Hall, a British beautician, allegedly tried to evade drug smuggling charges by attempting to trick ICE into deporting her back to the UK, but the scheme backfired, and she was jailed.\\nCONTEXT: Hall faces 60 years if convicted on drug charges.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 50944, 'sourceId': 12615, 'url': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14689865/Dog-pool-Adelaide.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490', 'title': \"Heart-stopping moment dog owner jumps into pool to save clumsy pooch TWICE: 'No survival instincts'\", 'publishDate': '2025-05-08T06:11:57.000Z', 'content': \"05:20, 08 May 2025, updated 07:11, 08 May 2025 By CHARLOTTE MCINTYRE FOR DAILY MAIL AUSTRALIA READ MORE: British tourist unsettled by Aussie cafe\\xa0Wild footage captured the moment a dog owner had to jump into her pool twice to save her clumsy pooch from drowning in her backyard.\\xa0Shannon Tremaine and her dad Vincent were forced to act fast when their Miniature Schnauzer, Chloe, fell into a pool in their Adelaide backyard.\\xa0In the viral footage, Ms Tremaine could be seen opening a gate and letting her dog explore the area surrounding the pool for the first time.\\xa0'If she falls in, at least we're here,' Vincent said.'That's the thing I'm most worried about is her falling in when we're not here,' Ms Tremaine said.Vincent appeared pretty confident the family pet wouldn't fall into the water, but his daughter wasn't so sure.\\xa0'I think she'll stumble in because she's clumsy,' Ms Tremaine said.As she predicted, Chloe wandered into the pool area and immediately slipped into the water.\\xa0 Shannon\\xa0Tremaine jumped into the pool to save her dog Chloe (pictured) Ms Tremaine's dad Vincent had to step in to help rescue Chloe (pictured) Although canine companions are famous for giving the doggy paddle a try in circumstances like this one, Chloe could be seen panicking.As\\xa0the Miniature Schnauzer struggled to keep her head above water, Ms Tremaine waited momentarily before jumping into the pool to save her dog.One side of the pool was visibly very deep and Ms Tremaine needed her dad's help to rescue Chloe.'At first we thought she would be fine because she used to be able to swim and I thought she would swim to me [when I jumped in] then I could scoop her up,' Ms Tremaine told Yahoo.\\xa0'But when I realised she was swimming down instead of up it was terrifying.''That went well,' Vincent remarked as he lifted his dog out of the water.Vincent and Ms Tremaine dried Chloe off with a towel, but moments later the clumsy pooch ended up in the water for a second time.\\xa0In a subsequent video, Ms Tremaine explained Chloe got distracted by her dad eating his breakfast and fell in as she attempted to get a closer look.\\xa0 Chloe fell immediately into the pool after being allowed to explore the area for the first time After rescuing Chloe once, Ms Tremaine jumped in a second time to save her clumsy dog (pictured) Once again Ms Tremaine jumped in after her to save the dog.However, Chloe didn't make things easy for Ms Tremaine as the owner struggled to keep her dog afloat in the opposite end of the pool, which was shallower but very slippery.The clip, which has been watched more than 48million times in just five days, attracted the attention of some trolls who criticised Chloe's swimming skills and the owners for not acting sooner.One viewer commented: 'That dog has like no survival instincts - because tell me why it started doing synchronised swimming under water????''I have never seen a dog that’s THAT bad at swimming like immediately swimming circles UNDERWATER,' another wrote.'Girl didn’t even stumble she walked STRAIGHT in,' a third added.\\xa0After the clip went viral, Ms Tremaine sat down with Chloe in an adorable interview-style clip to answer some of the internet's most asked questions.Ms Tremaine explained Chloe used to be able to swim, which is why she didn't immediately jump in.\\xa0 The pooch was diagnosed with\\xa0vestibular disease last year and Ms Tremaine believes this has affected her ability to swim as it impacts her balance under water.Ms Tremaine assured viewers Chloe received the all-clear from the vets soon after the incident.\", 'location': 'AUS', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Dog saved from drowning twice in pool\\nENTITIES: Shannon Tremaine, Vincent, Chloe\\nEVENT: Shannon Tremaine had to jump into her pool twice to save her Miniature Schnauzer, Chloe, from drowning after it fell in.

A shadow darts among them: a blackcap, pecking aphids from the underside of the leaves.The insects hatched from overwintering eggs in early April, congregating on loosening bud scales, waiting for tender new leaves to unfurl. Now there are legions of them, aligned along leaf veins, hypodermic stylets plugged in, siphoning sweet sap while simultaneously giving birth to more. They stand with regimented parade-ground spacing, just close enough to stay in touch with their long antennae. A shiver of fidgeting sweeps through the colony as the blackcap approaches.Blackcaps are one of several warbler species that eat sycamore aphids. Photograph: Phil GatesConservationists are quick to point out that sycamore sits close to the bottom of an oft-quoted league table of diversity of insect species hosted by trees, but there is an alternative measure of the tree’s value. That superabundance of a single aphid species contributes to a food web of warblers, tits, hirundines and predatory insects. It’s an ecosystem asset. A 20-metre specimen can host an estimated 2.5 million aphids, diverting its photosynthetic energy into fuelling their own exponential reproductive potential. They in turn fall prey to hoverfly larvae, ladybirds and lacewings. In summer, the winged adults join the aerial plankton hunted by swallows, house martins and swifts. Survivors will lay overwintering eggs in leaf buds, ready for next spring’s population explosion.Sycamore, non-native and invasive, is perhaps our least-loved deciduous tree. As long ago as 1664, John Evelyn, in his Sylva, a treatise on Britain’s trees, despised sycamore for its “honey-dew leaves, which fall … and mar our walks”, and wanted to see it “banished from gardens and avenues”. Motorists might concur if they park in its shade and find cars covered in a sticky film of honeydew, excess tree sap that falls in a constant rain from aphid anuses after they’ve extracted nutrients they need.And yet, for all the species’ purported faults, the felling of the famous Sycamore Gap specimen, a landmark on Hadrian’s Wall familiar to generations of walkers, provoked an outpouring of public\\xa0grief and outrage.

Finding the right controller, however, can be an arduous task. In 2020, Backbone landed on the scene and instantly became a hot favorite for gaming on phones.\\nRecommended Videos\\nOver the years, the company has released two iterations of its One controller, and even one for PlayStation fans. With its latest, the Backbone Pro, the company hopes you won’t look for another controller. From mobile and cloud devices to PC and VR hardware, this is one controller to rule them all.\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\nBackbone went back to the engineering table and made a host of changes to ensure that the Pro can be used in USB-tethered mode, as well as a standalone mode. That mandated a bulk-up, but also introduced perks that gaming enthusiasts will love. The price is still at a premium, but the sum total of this $169.99 package is more than what you would get from an average controller.\\nThoughtful design, stunning build\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\nThe Backbone Pro is bigger and bulkier than its One sibling, though it still tips the scales at under 200 grams. Maneet Khaira, the founding chief of Backbone, tells me that the flagship controller has been in development for over three years and entailed hundreds of 3D-printed prototypes.\\nOver the course of testing, the team performed camera capture to finalize the most comfortable grip, button layout, and even the texture work. The updated thumbsticks required multiple micrometer-level adjustments to get them right.\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\nAll the work that went into design and engineering reflects during usage. I’ve tried nearly half a dozen game controllers in the past few months, including those with a telescoping bar like the Pro. The Backbone controller stands out with its superb build quality and weight balance.\\nA neat touch on the Pro model is the dotted texture on the handle. It’s not rubberized, but it still offers a remarkable surface-level grip. Khaira tells me that the team experimented with multiple laser-etched textures to ensure that it’s not too rough, and doesn’t get the palm sweaty either.\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\nJumping across different venues in Grid Legends in a sweltering 98 degrees Fahrenheit weather, the Backbone Pro did an admirable job at maintaining surface grip against my perspiring palms and prevented slipping.\\nThe handles are thicker this time around, and I quite like them. It’s a personal perk because I’ve grown used to the official Xbox controller and felt right at home with the Backbone Pro. The added heft is also reassuring. In hindsight, it offers a more controlled experience if you are using gyro tilt in racing games.\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\nThe Backbone Pro also throws a couple of customizable rear buttons into the mix. Positioned towards the inner side of the handle, these curved buttons offer a satisfying click feedback and really come in handy for games with crowded controls.\\nThe telescopic bar can fit any smartphone easily, including the big ones like the iPhone 16 Pro Max and Red Magic 10 Pro. It barely falls short of accommodating the iPad mini. Thankfully, the controller won’t cause any trouble if you don’t want to take the case off your phone.\\nThe best-grade inputs out there\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\nFor all that increase in size and heft, the Backbone Pro added a serious functional perk. In addition to using it in tethered mode via the USB-C insert, this one can also act as a standalone wireless controller for all your devices, including TVs, tablets, and laptops.\\nI spent most of my time using the controller in wireless mode, burning up hours in Warframe, Alien: Isolation, and the new Resident Evil titles. I didn’t run into any issues with latency, and the pairing process was also fairly seamless across the screens I tried.\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\nThis dexterity also ties into a continuity feature for gaming. For example, if you left playing a game at a certain point on a large screen, you can seamlessly carry it over on a phone via the official streaming client, such as Xbox Cloud.\\n“We want to support every platform,” Khaira told me during a live demonstration of the Backbone Pro controller. So far, my own experience with playing games across various formats has been fairly smooth and hassle-free.\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\nIn wireless mode, the built-in battery is touted to last 40 hours. I couldn’t verify this number, and honestly, you shouldn’t be concerned about it, either. That’s because the controllers allow parallel charging via the USB-C port on the right handle.\\nWhen plugged in, the port can top up the phone as well as the built-in battery. Technically, I never ran out of juice during my gaming sessions. Thankfully, the companion app conveniently shows the phone and the controller’s battery levels, so you can keep an eye on the drain.\\nA versatile gaming experience\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\nThe buttons and sticks you get on the Backbone Pro are arguably the best you will find on a controller out there. Period. In retrospect, you shouldn’t settle for anything less at this asking price.\\nThe round action buttons offer a nice clicky feedback with a satisfying level of vertical travel, perfect for mashing during your dungeon grinds. The D-Pad, in contrast, offers a quieter response, but they’re really well put together.\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\nThe slight elevation on the edges and a concave profile combine to offer a rewarding circular input for executing combos in fighting games. The Hall Effect triggers, unsurprisingly, perform just as well and keep concerns of drifting at bay.\\nMy favorite element of the controller is the full-sized ALPS joysticks. They have a nice texture around the periphery for extra grip. The pair offers precise movement control, especially in racing games where cornering and hand-brake combos require nimble fingers and subtle radial movements.\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\nYou can calibrate the trigger depth and also configure the thumbstick dead zone. Button remapping is also part of the package, but I wish the app also offered an in-game launcher experience, the way labels like Red Magic have executed.\\nI had a fantastic time gaming with the Backbone Pro and can report that the aspects such as depth sensitivity, response time, and keypress feedback are all top-notch. The only misstep was the occasional bugs in the app, which is to be expected while running a TestFlight build.\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\nIn the stable version that I was running on the Red Magic 10 Pro and OnePlus 13, I didn’t notice any lag or non-responsive buttons. Depending on the platform, you can also save custom key presets and set unique profiles, as well.\\nA rewarding controller app\\nThe most enticing element of the Backbone Pro experience is actually the mobile app. The layout and feel will be second nature to Xbox mobile app users if you’re on Team Green. The app has been beautifully designed, and the content organization is lovely.\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\nGames are neatly sorted across platforms, categories, and the cloud service providers. The app acts more like an aggregator, where you can seamlessly pick up games across Android, iOS, Apple Arcade, Xbox, Nvidia GeForce Now, and other libraries. And yes, you can launch the games directly, as well.\\nThe game cards are dynamic, which means even without tapping on them, you can get a short preview of the gameplay. When I launched the app, I got access to a bunch of freebies with the Backbone+ subscription, such as Discord Nitro and Apple Arcade for three months.\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\nThe biggest surprise? A native emulation tool in the Backbone app. The team has built a unified system where emulation cores for multiple retro Nintendo consoles have been placed in a single container. For now, you can enjoy games for SNES, NES, Game Boy, and Game Boy Advance platforms.\\nThe Backbone chief tells me that the emulation stack will go as far back as Nintendo 64. When I asked about bringing more legacy console platforms, Khaira said it’s not about choosing a side (read: Sony or Nintendo), but technical capabilities. “We want to support every platform,” he put it bluntly.\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\nBackbone is currently testing emulation cores for PlayStation 1, PSP, and Nintendo DS, in case you’re wondering. When I asked him to dig further into the challenges at hand, the Backbone chief told me that the “biggest constraint is memory on the phone.”\\nTying it all together is the Backbone+ subscription, which serves a bunch of exclusive tools and benefits. Priced at $39.99 per year, it offers $35 worth of in-game benefits, a 30% discount on Backbone products, the ability to record game videos at full-HD 60fps with cloud storage, in-app voice chats, and Twitch direct streaming.\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\nThe best, however, is yet to come. Khaira tells me that the subscription bundle will bring more titles and content later this year. “We are working on adding licensed games into the subscription bundle,” he tells me.\\nIn addition to new games, Backbone envisions offering free games as well as instantly playable games that can work offline with the premium bundle. “We want to bring down the barrier of entry as much as possible,” Khaira explains, adding that Backbone hopes to evolve into a gaming platform of its own by working with multiple partners in the gaming industry.\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\n“We are really trying to be an alternative way to play games.”\\n– Maneet Khaira, founder and CEO of Backbone.\\nVerdict\\nThe Backbone Pro is an unabashedly premium controller. But for its $169.99 ask, it inches close to the territory where you find first-party controllers from the console warlords. But where the Backbone option races ahead is the sheer flexibility.\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\nThe buttons and joysticks are fantastic, and so is the flexibility of using it in docked as well as standalone mode across different platforms. From a hardware perspective, it is as good as it gets.\\nIf your preferred gaming platform is mobile devices, and the best experience is what you seek, the Backbone Pro will serve you just fine. It goes a step further by offering a fantastic catalog aggregator in the mobile app. For fans of emulation, the built-in emulator will be a huge draw.\\nThe Backbone One will remain on the shelf at its $99.99 ask, going against the Razer Kishi V2. And if you’re looking for budget alternatives, the GameSir X5 Lite is a great option.

Some are facing pressure from building groups to reject updated standards that would modernize new buildings while increasing construction costs.“Right now, a hospital and fire station are built to the same level of protection as a hot dog stand.” —Rob Moore, senior policy analyst The council committee approval was a victory for flood specialists, environmentalists and insurance groups, who say added construction costs will more than pay for themselves by reducing future flood damage.“This represents a sorely needed critical leap forward in flood resilience,” Aaron Davis, deputy executive director of BuildStrong America, told the committee Friday. The group is a coalition of consumer groups, architects, insurance groups and other advocates of modernized building codes.Chad Berginnis, executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers, said the flood standards would curb growing flood damage worldwide as climate change intensifies storms and development increases in flood zones.The standard was opposed by the National Association of Home Builders, the National Multifamily Housing Council and the American Society for Health Care Engineering.“Our concern with this is that these will increase the cost of construction for new construction,” Jonathan Flannery, the society’s senior associate director of regulatory affairs, told the committee.East Houston Medical Center and Gonzalez Family & Occupational Medicine on I-10 still has water standing during Hurricane Harvey, Wednesday, August 30, 2017.Juan DeLeon/Icon Sportswire via Getty ImagesOne of the standards approved Friday would expand local flood zones so that more structures are subject to elevation requirements.Flannery said the requirement would discourage health care facilities from locating inside flood zones, where elevation requirements would increase construction costs.“If a community is looking at building a facility … and it can be built for 1 percent less outside the flood zone, they’ll do that. Yet the need may be in the flood zone area,” Flannery said.Louisiana State University construction expert Carol Friedland told the committee that the flood standards would increase the number of buildings in flood zones by five percent. They also would impose “modest cost increases” of between 0.5 percent and 2 percent in construction.But the standards would sharply reduce the chances of a building being damaged by flooding, Friedland said.The standards would apply to basic buildings such as residential or commercial structures and to “somewhat critical facilities” such as schools and “critical facilities” including hospitals. The flood standards would be higher for buildings that are more critical.“Right now, a hospital and fire station are built to the same level of protection as a hot dog stand,” Rob Moore, a senior policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told the committee.The committee approved the flood standards three days after a separate council committee rejected a proposal to increase standards for newly built homes.The homebuilders association strongly opposed requiring higher elevation of more homes because of the added construction cost.The association has opposed similar efforts in states and by the federal government under former President Joe Biden. A Biden-era policy that required the elevation of structures built with federal disaster aid was canceled by President Donald Trump.Reprinted from E&E News with permission from POLITICO, LLC.

Here’s one that has been proven to work.\\nA worker assembles components of modular housing in the Capsys factory in the Brooklyn Navy Yard in New York in 2016, shortly before it was repurposed as the Nehemiah Spring Creek housing development.(Richard Levine / Corbis via Getty Images)\\nEzra Klein and Derek Thompson’s new book, Abundance, is riding high on the bestseller lists. The authors argue that something has gone very wrong in our nation: “Over the course of the 20th century, America developed a right that fought government and a left that hobbled it.” They focus on a set of changes—relaxing zoning restrictions, reducing or ending review by local government and environmental agencies, among others—that would make some impact on the current crisis. At the same time, those on the left often propose a massive new investment in what is called social housing. But both sets of proposed solutions miss the mark. And neither addresses an underlying reality that both impedes housing production and explains the growing equity gap between the housing haves and the housing have-nots: the lack of a robust strategy for affordable home building.\\nThe two celebrated political analysts admit to being liberals and confess that their primary audience is the Democratic Party. I wish them luck. I worry, however, that they and those on the left are underestimating the power of the current culture they seek to transform.\\nMy colleagues and I know how powerful this culture is because we have been fighting it for 40 years. When we proposed building housing on vast tracts of vacant and abandoned New York City land—first in East Brooklyn, then in the South Bronx—we met with a top civic official, who listened impatiently before replying, “Your eyes are bigger than your stomachs.”\\nAs it turned out, our stomachs were big. We ultimately built thousands of affordable houses, called Nehemiah homes, in East Brooklyn and the South Bronx that working people could buy and maintain.\\nWe didn’t call it “abundance.” We called it critical mass: building at scale, with speed. This ran against the then-conventional wisdom that the way to rebuild cities was by sprinkling a few new units here and a few new units there.\\nBuilding at scale replaced all the negative chain reactions—abandonment, business flight, crime, despair, nihilism—with a constructive chain reaction of ownership, wealth creation, retail growth, upgraded parks, improved health and education indicators, hope and more. We succeeded. Though it took longer than it should have.\\nCurrent Issue\\nThe problem was not primarily hobbling from the left that the authors describe, nor resistance from the right—not that there was much of a right in New York. The issue was that the Nehemiah effort’s proven success—the transformation of entire blocks—was not adopted in other cities without enormous pressure from our local leaders and institutions.\\nHere’s why.\\nFirst, a consensus developed that the best way to build affordable housing is through tax credits—which favor renting over owning. This does nothing to close the terrible equity gap throughout our country. A coalition of developers, nonprofits, consultants, housing intermediaries, elected and appointed officials, and financial institutions—all of which benefit from the reliance on tax credits—has dominated the discussion of building affordable housing in recent decades. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program unlocks private investment in low-income housing efforts. The New Market Tax Credit approach does the same for those interested in financing businesses, daycare centers, charter schools, and other community amenities. Neither provides a path to ownership and equity for those on the economic margins. These approaches are constructive and create some impact. But they have become comfortable monopolies, blandly accepted by many as the only way to rebuild communities.\\nSecond, institutions charged with producing this housing—including the Federal Home Loan Banks, the billion-dollar intermediaries like Enterprise and the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, the multibillion-dollar foundations that funnel through these intermediaries—have amassed fortunes, paid their executives handsomely, and opted for safe and predictable housing strategies. Meanwhile, they have done little to address the housing production crisis—even as millions of Americans remain plagued by housing scarcity.\\nThird, lack of leadership. Klein and Thompson rightly decry a policy universe filled with lawyers:\\nIn the Democratic Party, every presidential and vice-presidential nominee from Walter Mondale to Kamala Harris (Tim Walz, in this respect, was an almost radical break with tradition) attended law school. [W]hen you make legal training the default training for a political career, you make legal thinking the default thinking in politics. And legal thinking centers around statutory language and commitment to process, not results and outcomes.\\nAmen.\\nFourth, what Klein and Thompson mostly miss is the role of third-sector organizations in the robust effort to transform our political culture. At the Industrial Areas Foundation, we understood from day one that our ability to succeed had nothing to do with the quality of our plans or the design of our homes or, as Klein and Thompson describe it, “a new theory of supply.”\\nPopular\\n“swipe left below to view more authors”Swipe →\\nInstead, it had everything to do with whether we had the power to make mayors and governors respond to our demands, and enough persistence to keep them responding over years and decades. When we began the rebuilding of East Brooklyn and the South Bronx, we didn’t begin with an attempt to alter zoning regulations or to wait for what one deputy mayor recommended when we said that the Koch administration lacked a housing strategy. He said, “Yes, we do. It’s called federal money.”\\nIf we had taken him seriously, we would still be waiting; thousands of minority homebuyers would still be stuck in substandard rental and public housing, and nearly $2 billion in equity would never have been created. Instead, we began with a power analysis of the city at the time. We raised our own no-interest construction financing—something the left never does. And we persuaded Koch to make an unprecedented investment of city funds in our effort and the efforts of others. Then, policy changed—in response to the power of the organization and our growing track record of success. No matter what new theory or consensus emerges, the fundamental role that power, and powerful organizations, play will still be key.\\nForty years after we began building in East Brooklyn, 20 years after its success was obvious to just about anyone who looked, our affiliates in Chicago, United Power for Action and Justice, and in Baltimore, BUILD, have finally begun to build at the pace and scale needed to reclaim the depopulated stretches of those cities. Apparently, there is still an appetite for a major push toward new and even bigger critical masses of affordable ownership housing.\\nOur New York Metro Industrial Areas Foundation affiliates will increase the pressure until that appetite grows. But mayors and governors and others need to match or exceed the kinds of commitments that an initially reluctant Ed Koch made. We know from experience that this combination of organized citizen power and responsive local leadership can make all the difference—and actually get affordable housing built.\\nMike Gecan\\nMike Gecan worked as an organizer and then national codirector of the Industrial Areas Foundation for more than four decades.

It's the first time she has testified\", 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T19:18:29.000Z', 'content': \"NEW YORK -- Days into Harvey Weinstein 's first sexual assault trial in 2020, prosecutors privately spoke for the first time with a former model who alleged that he had forced oral sex on her. But that jury was never told about Kaja (KEYE’-ah) Sokola's claim. Prosecutors have said they still were investigating the allegation when Weinstein, a onetime movie tycoon-turned- #MeToo pariah, was convicted in February 2020 of charges based on other women's accusations.On Wednesday, Sokola began to tell a new jury her story. Sokola didn't look at Weinstein as she walked past him and onto the witness stand in a Manhattan courtroom where he's on trial again. An appeals court overturned his 2020 rape and sexual assault conviction, sending those charges back for retrial, and prosecutors subsequently added another sexual assault charge based on Sokola's allegations. As she began testifying about her life before the alleged 2006 assault, Weinstein looked toward her, with his right hand across his mouth.Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty to all the charges. His lawyers contend that his accusers consented to sexual encounters with him in hopes of getting movie and TV opportunities, and the defense has emphasized that the women stayed in contact with him for a while after the alleged assaults.The women, meanwhile, say the Oscar-winning producer used the prospect of show business work to prey on them.The Polish-born Sokola, 39, sued Weinstein after industry whispers about his behavior toward women became a chorus of public accusations in 2017, fueling the #MeToo movement and its calls for accountability for sexual misconduct. Prosecutors have said Sokola eventually received $3.5 million in compensation.She was introduced to Weinstein while on a modeling trip to New York in 2002, when she was 16, according to prosecutors. In her lawsuits, Sokola said that shortly after she met Weinstein, he invited her to lunch to discuss her career but then sexually assaulted her. The lawsuits alleged he sexually harassed and emotionally abused her for years afterward.The criminal charge stems from one instance when Sokola maintains that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in a Manhattan hotel in May 2006. Prosecutors have said it happened after Weinstein arranged for Sokola to be an extra in the film “The Nanny Diaries” and met her visiting older sister, whom she was trying to impress. “She was proud of knowing him,” her sister, cardiologist Dr. Ewa (pronounced EH’-vah) Sokola, told jurors Wednesday.She said the three of them met in a hotel lobby, chatted for about an hour about Italian movies and the heavyset Weinstein's heart health, and then he and the model left the table together.Kaja Sokola was tense when she returned about a half-hour later — “like somebody waiting for the result of an exam” or the Oscars — but didn't say anything about the alleged sexual assault, Dr. Sokola told jurors.She said she was shocked to learn about the claim over a decade later, when she read about it in a magazine article.Weinstein's lawyers will get a chance to question Kaja Sokola in the coming days. In an opening statement last month, defense attorney Arthur Aidala questioned why she waited years to come forward. Prosecutors have argued that accusers were reluctant to speak up because of Weinstein's wealth and influence.Prosecutors have said Sokola's attorneys contacted them on the eve of Weinstein's first trial to say she was willing to be interviewed. Prosecutors have said they soon spoke with her and began investigating, but didn't initially pursue charges because Weinstein was convicted and the coronavirus pandemic loomed.They revived the Sokola investigation after New York's highest court reversed Weinstein's conviction. Weinstein's lawyers fought unsuccessfully to keep Sokola's allegation out of the retrial. They accused prosecutors of “smuggling an additional charge into the case for the improper purpose of bolstering the credibility” of other accusers. One of the others, Miriam Haley, testified last week that Weinstein forced oral sex on her in 2006. The third accuser in the case, Jessica Mann, is expected to testify later.The Associated Press generally does not name sexual assault accusers without their permission, which Haley, Mann and Sokola have given.\", 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Ex-model testifies in Harvey Weinstein retrial\\nENTITIES: Harvey Weinstein, Kaja Sokola, Miriam Haley, Jessica Mann\\nEVENT: Kaja Sokola testified in Harvey Weinstein's retrial, alleging he forced oral sex on her in 2006; this is the first time she has testified.\\nCONTEXT: Weinstein's 2020 conviction was overturned, leading to this retrial.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 51031, 'sourceId': 12628, 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/d2d9afed-9fb1-4b21-90a4-fbfd5391c528', 'title': 'UK looking at setting up youth mobility scheme with EU, minister says', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T04:00:58.000Z', 'content': 'Unlock the Editor’s Digest for freeRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.Nick Thomas-Symonds, European relations minister, has confirmed publicly for the first time that Britain is looking at setting up a youth mobility scheme as part of a new “strategic partnership” with the EU, to be launched at a summit this month.Days after Nigel Farage’s anti-EU Reform UK delivered a bloody nose to Labour in local elections, Thomas-Symonds used an interview with the Financial Times to prepare the ground for a politically contentious deal with Brussels at a summit in London on May 19.The summit will agree a new UK-EU security and defence pact, increasing co-operation on procurement and training. But it will also set in train months of negotiations on a wide-ranging package of economic reforms and on the creation of some kind of youth experience scheme.Thomas-Symonds, who is heading ministerial “reset” efforts, previously insisted there were “no plans” for a youth mobility scheme, a key EU demand that would enable young adults from member states to study and work in the UK and vice versa. But on Tuesday he said that provided the UK government’s red lines were respected, “a smart, controlled youth mobility scheme would of course have benefits for our young people”.Ministers have indicated privately that they would cap numbers in any scheme and make it time limited, and Thomas-Symonds confirmed: “We will consider sensible EU proposals in this space.”He said Sir Keir Starmer, prime minister, had made it clear Britain would not return to free movement or rejoin the customs union or single market. The government was also committed to bringing down net migration, he added.But Thomas-Symonds said Britain already had youth mobility deals with countries including Australia and Uruguay, adding: “Nobody is suggesting any of those schemes, smart and controlled, are about freedom of movement.”Thomas-Symonds also suggested Britain would be prepared to allow EU fishermen to continue to enjoy current access to UK waters when a five-year agreement expires in 2026.He said it would have to be part of a wider deal to secure easier access for British fishermen selling their catch on the continent. “We are looking for an overall arrangement that is beneficial to our fishers,” he said.Thomas-Symonds left open the door to Britain continuing to align with EU rules in food standards and animal welfare, saying: “We are not interested in divergence for divergence sake or a race to the bottom on standards.”He also indicated Britain was prepared to accept a role for the European Court of Justice as part of a deal to cut red tape on cross-channel trade. “You would expect there to be an appropriate dispute resolution mechanism,” he said.Asked if he feared a backlash from Farage and Kemi Badenoch’s Conservatives, Thomas-Symonds said he looked forward to presenting the benefits of an accord to voters, who rejected Labour and the Tories in local elections in England last week. “I don’t worry about selling something that we believe would make the UK more secure and more prosperous,” he said. “This is a package for which we have a strong mandate from the British people. We need to move on from the debates of the past; this is forward-looking. It’s where the European continent is in the mid-2020s, not where it was in 2016.”Badenoch has already claimed that a youth mobility deal risks creating “another avenue which people might use to game the system”, while warning that Starmer was about to “sell out” British fishermen.After Reform’s gains last week, Thomas-Symonds’ comments are the prelude to a major political offensive by Starmer and other ministers to explain why closer EU ties will bring benefits to voters.Thomas-Symonds talked repeatedly about a “package” of reforms that he claimed would be popular with the public, from cutting red tape at borders in order to bring down food prices to making it easier for professionals or touring musicians to work on the continent.On a defence deal, he said: “At this moment in European history it’s not in the interests of the European continent to have fragmentation of our defence industrial capacity.”Asked whether Britain might at some point rejoin the Erasmus student exchange programme, Thomas-Symonds did not rule it out. “We don’t have plans to return to Erasmus,” he said. “But we are always open to listening to sensible proposals from the EU, but they have to be within the framework we’ve set out.” He said any closer ties to Europe had to be “part of a package which is in the national interest”.London has refused to cut university tuition fees for EU students to UK levels and any change to that policy would come with a considerable price tag. In the last seven-year Erasmus cycle, the UK contributed €2bn more than it received because more EU students used it than British ones.Additional reporting by Andy Bounds in Brussels', 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: UK considers youth mobility scheme with EU\\nENTITIES: UK, EU, Nick Thomas-Symonds, Keir Starmer, Nigel Farage, Kemi Badenoch\\nEVENT: The UK government is exploring a youth mobility scheme with the EU, allowing young adults to study and work in both regions, and is open to discussing continued access to UK waters for EU fishermen as part of a wider trade deal.\\nCONTEXT: The UK is considering a youth mobility scheme with the EU as part of a broader strategic partnership, aiming to improve relations post-Brexit.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 50659, 'sourceId': 12612, 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/f2a5e12f-0599-4f7d-a3ec-6db7050df2a0', 'title': 'UK and EU split over youth mobility deal, negotiating document shows', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T18:06:07.000Z', 'content': 'The UK and the EU are deeply split over the terms of a youth mobility scheme that is a key part of a post-Brexit “reset” agreement, fresh negotiating documents show.\\xa0With only two weeks to go until a crucial London summit kicking off formal negotiations, the two remain far apart on a deal to allow 18 to 30-year-olds on both sides of the Channel to travel and work more freely in each other’s countries.The EU is demanding a “dedicated visa” to enable young people to work, study or “simply travel” in the UK as long as they have sufficient funds, according to a draft document discussed by EU ambassadors on Wednesday. It also proposes that EU students should return to paying the same £9,535 fees to attend British universities as home students.A UK “counterproposal” suggests the two sides “explore” a much narrower scheme that is “time-limited [and] capped” and would mean visitors had “no right to bring dependants or access benefits”, the document adds. The UK government has repeatedly rejected Brussels’ version of a youth mobility deal arguing that it is too close to restoring the “free movement of people” that was ended by the 2016 Brexit vote.\\xa0Instead, the UK said it would push for a deal to improve the rights for musicians and other touring artists. The proposed text says only that the European Commission proposes to “provide clear information to artists” on rules they need to comply with.Brussels also wants the UK to work towards rejoining the “Erasmus+” student exchange programme, the document states — though European relations minister Nick Thomas-Symonds this week told the Financial Times there were no plans to rejoin. At their summit on May 19 at Lancaster House, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will announce a new security and defence partnership, alongside a plan for a new EU-UK “common understanding”.The documents set out plans to deepen co-operation in areas including energy, emissions trading, co-operation on crime fighting and tackling illegal migration, along with removing barriers to trade in food and animal products.The UK has asked for “more flexibility” than EU countries to impose controls on food and plant imports. But the document states that the UK must accept so-called “dynamic alignment” that would result in it automatically following EU rules, and requests an “adequate financial contribution” to pay for the EU’s work in that area.\\xa0In a win for London, it adds that any food agreement will be governed by an “independent arbitration panel”, which avoids the European Court of Justice having direct jurisdiction over the UK.London officials would be involved in early stage drafting of new laws covered by dynamic alignment, in a sign that any veterinary deal following EU rules will inevitably pull the two sides closer together.\\xa0The UK would also be required to make “adequate financial contribution” to any European emissions trading system if the pair chose to link their separate programmes, the document states. Beyond the disagreements on trade and mobility, the two sides will also agree on an expansive security and defence partnership that will create regular meetings, repairing what one UK diplomat called the “institutional rupture” caused by Brexit.\\xa0According to the draft text, the UK and EU will establish a six-monthly “foreign policy dialogue” between the British foreign secretary and the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs.\\xa0The EU will also “regularly” invite the UK to high-level meetings, including the quarterly meetings of the European Council of EU leaders, alongside an annual defence dialogue, training exchanges and possible staff secondments.\\xa0A UK government spokesperson said any final deal would be in “the national interest”, adding: “These are EU internal draft texts.

But there’s still changes to be made to the game in the meantime.\\nRecommended Videos\\nA new update going live tonight adds an interesting quality-of-life update that I didn’t know I needed, but now I’m thankful for it because it just makes sense. It’s also a great example of some of the small changes that help make a liveservice game that much more. Screenshot by Destructoid The issue in question? The emote and spray wheel. NetEase Games says the May 8 update for the game will now split it into two separate wheels, one for emotes and one for sprays, instead of having them both on the same button. Hotkeys can be assigned for the separate options. Not only that, but a new option will allow you to set your spray wheel to be shared across all heroes, which is my favorite part of this update. I cannot be bothered to go into each hero and customize the sprays, which are also in big need of organization options in the future. Now, I can have the spray I want in the same slot across every hero. And if you don’t want the uniformity, you can keep things as is no problem. In short, it’s a welcome change, even if it wasn’t actually a problem to begin with. In similar games, sprays and emotes also have their own buttons, so this type of change is a no-brainer, now that I do think about it. The hard part, though, will be un-learning all of the muscle memory used in the game over its first five months since launch. I shudder at the thought. And hey, while we’re talking about quality-of-life changes, Marvel Rivals could also do well with a “play of the game” feature like and killcams like Overwatch 2 has, because what’s the point of a good spray or emote if I can’t use it to taunt my enemies after I pop off with a team wipe? Come on, NetEase, get it together. You can check out the full list of changes on the game’s official website.\\nPost Tag:\\nDestructoid is supported by our audience.

From 1961 to 1983, the U.S.’s old space race rival launched 16 probes, Venera 1 through Venera 16, that either flew by, orbited, or landed on Venus—with three of them failing en route. It’s been decades since the Russians bothered with Venus, but this week, an artifact from that long-ago space program may very well bother us: Sometime between May 9 and May 11, an 1,100-lb Venus spacecraft known as Kosmos 482, which has been stuck in Earth orbit since 1972, will come crashing back to the ground, potentially threatening anyone on Earth living between 52° North and 52° South of the equator—which covers the overwhelming share of us. Here’s what you need to know.Kosmos 482 was originally intended to be known as Venera 9. It was launched on March 31, 1972, just four days after its sister probe, Venera 8. That ship had a brief but glorious life. It arrived at Venus on July 22, 1972, spent close to an hour descending through the atmosphere, and landed at 6:24 a.m. local Venus time. (Local time on another world is calculated the same way it is on Earth—by measuring the angle of the sun relative to the meridians, or lines of longitude.)Once on the ground, Venera 8 lived for only 63 minutes, which is about what was expected given Venus’s hellish conditions. The atmospheric pressure is 93 times greater than it is on Earth, with a sea level pressure of 1,350 pounds per square inch (psi) compared to just 14.7 psi here. The air is mostly carbon dioxide, which, together with Venus's greater proximity to the sun, means an average temperature 860°F—or more than 200 degrees hotter than the melting point of lead.That was the future that awaited Venera 9 too, but things didn’t work out for what turned out to be a snakebit ship. After reaching Earth orbit, it fired its engine to enter what is known as a Venus transfer trajectory; that engine burn went awry, however, either cutting off too soon or not reaching a sufficient thrust to send the spacecraft on its way. Instead, it remained in an elliptical Earth orbit, with an apogee, or high point, of 560 miles, and a perigee, or low point, of 130 miles. There it has remained for the past 53 years. For its pains, Venera 9 lost not only its mission but its name. Abiding by Soviet-era nomenclature rules, spacecraft that remain in orbit around the Earth are dubbed Kosmos, followed by a number—in this case, Kosmos 482.In 2022, Marco Langbroek, a Dutch archaeologist who toggled over to sky watching mid-career and now lectures on space situational awareness at The Netherlands’ Delft Technical University, completed a round of tracking Kosmos 482's orbit. In The Space Review, he wrote that the object would reenter Earth’s atmosphere sometime in 2025 or 2026, due to the steady accumulation of drag by the atmosphere’s upper reaches. Further tracking of the spacecraft’s trajectory—by Langbroek, NASA, and the nonprofit Aerospace Corporation—now predicts the reentry will occur on May 10, at 12:42 a.m., plus or minus 19 hours.“The reentry is an uncontrolled reentry,” Langbroek wrote on his website on April 24. “It likely will be a hard impact. I doubt the parachute deployment system will still work after 53 years and with dead batteries.”Medallion which was delivered to the surface of planet Venus by the soviet space probe Venera 3 on March 1, 1966. Universal Images Group—GettyOrdinarily, even a spacecraft as big as Kosmos 482 would not pose much danger to people on the ground. The same atmospheric friction that causes most meteors to burn up before they reach the surface disposes of errant satellites the same way. It is mostly far larger objects, like the U.S.’s Skylab space station—which reentered in July, 1979, scattering debris across the Australian outback—that cause concern. But Kosmos 482 is different; it was intentionally designed to withstand Venus’s pressure-cooker atmosphere, and even colliding with our own atmosphere at orbital speeds of 17,500 miles per hour, it could at least partly survive its plunge.“The risks involved are not particularly high, but not zero,” Langbroek writes. “With a mass of just under 500 kg and 1-meter size, risks are somewhat similar to that of a meteorite impact.”All of the land masses in Earth’s southern hemisphere are within the reentry footprint, along with the large majority of the north. Most of Russia, the U.K. the Balkans, Scandinavia, Canada, and Alaska are among the few places out of harm’s way.\\xa0Still, nobody is recommending calling the pets inside and crouching in fallout shelters. More than 70% of the Earth’s surface is water, meaning a 70% chance of a splashdown as opposed to a hard landing. What’s more, the landmasses in the reentry zone include largely unpopulated areas like the Sahara, Atacama, and Australian deserts.\\xa0It would, of course, be best if Kosmos 482 disintegrates entirely on reentry, but space sentimentalists are hoping that at least a bit of it survives. Venera probes, like all of the Soviet spacecraft sent to the moon and the planets, carried along with them small memorial coins, medals and titanium pennants—embossed with the hammer and sickle, the likeness of Lenin, the Earth, and more. Kosmos 482 will return to a world very different from the one it left—with the Soviet Union itself consigned to history. This week, after more than half a century, a bit of commemorative metal just may survive the empire that sent it aloft.\", 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Soviet Venus spacecraft to crash back to Earth\\nENTITIES: Soviet Union, Kosmos 482, Venera, NASA, Aerospace Corporation, Marco Langbroek\\nEVENT: Kosmos 482, a Venus-bound spacecraft stuck in Earth orbit since 1972, is predicted to reenter Earth's atmosphere around May 10, 2024, potentially scattering debris across a wide swath of the globe.\\nCONTEXT: Soviet-era spacecraft's reentry poses minimal but non-zero risk.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 51962, 'sourceId': 12729, 'url': 'https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/tv/eastenders-fans-convinced-lauren-peters-31593684', 'title': \"EastEnders fans convinced Lauren and Peter's baby named after former soap actor 'in tribute'\", 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T19:05:21.000Z', 'content': 'Manchester Evening News IconNewsTVEastEndersThe actor in question was working on the programme for 11 years20:05, 07 May 2025The baby arrived as Lauren connected with an unlikely figure(Image: BBC)EastEnders fans are convinced that Lauren Branning and Peter Beale’s baby is named after one of the show’s former actors.It’s been a period of departures on the BBC soap, with Sonia Fowler and Bianca Jackson both leaving last month after joining the programme in 1993.\\u200cOn top of this, viewers are still getting used to life without Martin Fowler and Reiss Colwell, who both died after an explosion at the Queen Vic in February’s 40th anniversary week.\\u200cWhile Ross Marshall and his son Joel arrived in April with a returning Vicki Fowler, fans have been desperate for new faces to show up in Walford.In scenes that aired on Wednesday night (May 8), Cindy Beale had to take matters into her own hands to get Lauren to hospital when their ambulance was delayed.Despite Cindy and Lauren being at odds before the former was bribed to leave Albert Square in February, they joined forces to get through the ordeal.Article continues belowPrior to Cindy’s affair with Junior Knight being exposed at Christmas, Lauren’s future-mum-in-law was supplying her with drugs in order to get easy money.Cindy Beale helped her former enemy Lauren through labour(Image: BBC)After returning to the show on Monday (May 5), Cindy showed a rare kind side as she shared a heart-to-heart with Lauren at the hospital.\\u200cWith the baby\\'s dad and her fianceé Peter nowhere to be seen, Lauren admitted that she feared the implications her addiction would have on her newborn.Lauren went on to give birth to a healthy baby, with Ian, Kathy and Peter Beale eventually arriving and ordering Cindy to leave.In spite of Cindy being there for Lauren when no one else was, Peter told his mum that he’s adamant he doesn’t want her in his life moving forward.\\u200cPeter and Lauren went on to arrive at a unanimous dedication to name their baby boy Jim Branning, as Cindy told Ian and Kathy that she was coming for their businesses.The name Jim Branning has caused debate among EastEnders fans on X, with many assuming it\\'s after Lauren\\'s late grandfather who was married to Dot Cotton.However, Martin Fowler actor James Bye was nicknamed Jimmy by his castmates, which many fans pointed out on the app previously known as Twitter.Article continues below@CallumWhitee_ said: “Why have they called it Jimmy?

Its effective military resistance against a much stronger adversary is in fact underpinned by this successful economic management. Rather than face institutional sclerosis or even collapse, Ukraine’s state capacity has been strengthened by the conflict. Through a combination of tax revenue collection and substantial networks of voluntary fundraising, the state has dramatically increased the size of its armed forces, invested in defence production and maintained a decent level of public infrastructure.State spending on soldiers’ wages, infrastructure and logistics – including public sector procurement from private firms – has had a positive knock-on effect, supporting demand in the civilian market economy. Soldiers on the frontline earn well above the national average wage. An innovative military industrial complex, combining traditional state-owned enterprises with an ecosystem of drone startups, has been developed. These policies have stabilised the Ukrainian economy and directed it to the goal of the country’s basic survival.But while Ukraine must be credited with these successes, it still lacks the resources domestically to meet the enormous costs of the war. External financial support has been vital to keeping the country afloat. Its wartime resilience is in this sense built on a contradiction: state capacity has grown considerably, but it has done so through a fundamental dependence on foreign financial assistance. Ukraine records a negative gross domestic savings rate, for example – an indicator of an economy that is consuming (including military spending) more each year than its annual economic output. This is made possible thanks to financial aid from Ukraine’s allies.As I argue in my recent report, Russo-Ukrainian War: The Political Economy of the Present Balance of Forces, despite this dependency, Ukraine has made the best of the situation, and Russia’s economic position is less strong than it is often portrayed.Russia’s economy is often seen as the success story of the all-out war – and it certainly defied expectations that it would descend into crisis under the effects of western sanctions. But this apparent strength disguises its fundamental dependency – not on its allies, but on fossil fuels. With oil and gas accounting for 30% to 50% of Russia’s government revenues over the past decade, and generating profits that sustain much of the rest of the economy, Russia is fundamentally a petrostate.In 2022, the global oil price spike helped Russia stabilise its economy. But with demand for oil now falling, its room for manoeuvre on the home front has narrowed. The trade-offs between the war and civilian economies will now become harder to manage.Longer-term supply and demand trends in global oil markets also pose a critical problem for Russia. The International Energy Agency predicts that over the next five years, the world will face an unprecedented supply glut, upending the price-setting power of petrostates and weakening the Russian economy.Unlike Ukraine, which has secured foreign financial assistance until 2027 in the form of aid and loans, Russia is running down liquid assets in its national wealth fund to finance its military. As the war persists, problems are developing in the Russian economy: a falling current-account surplus, rising inflation, high interest rates and a banking system put under strain by these growing contradictions. Ukraine’s inflation-adjusted central bank rate is now actually far lower than Russia’s, putting it in the peculiar position of being the country where the war is being fought, while also having a more stable monetary and banking system.On paper, Ukraine appears to be in the stronger economic position. But the recent minerals agreement with the United States complicates that assessment, offering a stark reminder of the country’s basic dependency on its allies.The deal creates a joint investment fund to access Ukraine’s mineral wealth, but on terms that are advantageous to the US. Ukraine will contribute half of all revenues from new mineral licences to capitalise the fund, without any equivalent obligation for the US to match these contributions. Yet, despite this inequity, Washington retains 50% control over decision-making. The deal even envisages that US military aid would be considered as a form of capitalisation of the fund, potentially giving the US a legal claim on future profits without having contributed any investment capital.The deal has been widely seen as a victory for Ukraine, owing to how earlier iterations contained far more onerous terms. In a win for Kyiv, those proposals have been dropped. But the final agreement still bears the marks of the raw colonialism of the original vision.From a commercial standpoint, the deal may not even work. Mineral extraction is notoriously high-risk and capital-intensive. Potential investors in projects created under the auspices of the fund will have to weigh up the political risks. A future Ukrainian government might repudiate the framework altogether – especially if the EU makes a better offer. Given that investments are already risky in Ukraine and some of the country’s mineral assets are under occupation, there is widespread scepticism that the fund will amount to much in practice.This may well help explain why Ukraine chose to sign the agreement: it has a primarily symbolic value, anchoring the US back in the camp of Ukraine supporters. Ukrainian officials point to the concessions they won: that the US formally recognises Russia as the aggressor in the war; has agreed to negotiate future changes required to make the fund compatible with Ukraine’s EU obligations if it were to join the bloc in the future in “good faith”; and acknowledges that the Ukrainian constitution explicitly places mineral assets in the hands of the Ukrainian people. Importantly, then, the deal could be rewritten if the EU demands it.Still, the narrative matters. The minerals agreement is a grim formalisation of the Trump administration’s view of international relations as coercive bullying, or what it calls “great power competition”. A country fighting for its democracy and sovereignty should not have to trade away its strategic resources. But the deal is about Ukraine playing for time and maintaining some level of US support for its war of self-defence. With Russia’s war machine facing the ticking clock of oil price declines, time might even be on Ukraine’s side.\\nLuke Cooper is an associate professorial research fellow in international relations at LSE Ideas, the in-house foreign policy thinktank of the London School of Economics and Political Science, and the director of PeaceRep’s Ukraine programme\\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Nerazzurri reached their second final in three season, after losing the 2023 edition in the 1-0 final against Pep Guardiola's Manchester City, and they have the chance to win their fourth ever Champions League trophy, after winning the last one in 2010 under Jose Mourinho at the end of the historical season when Inter won the treble. PSG, on the other side, are yet to win their first Champions League trophy, and they will play their second ever final of the tournament after losing 1-0 in the 2020 edition against Bayern Munich with the deciding goal scored by Kingsley Coman.\\xa0The team coached by Luis Enrique were able to reach the final after knocking out Arsenal in the two-legged semifinals, as the French giants won 1-0 in London before winning 2-1 the return leg in Paris on Wednesday, thanks to the goals scored by Fabian Ruiz and former Inter winger Achraf Hakimi. The Nerazzurri, on the other hand, managed to eliminate Barcelona in the semifinals after knocking out Bayern Munich in the quarterfinals, as Simone Inzaghi's side played one of the most memorable Champions League ties in the history of the game, and at the end managed to win 4-3 the return leg with the winning goal scored by Davide Frattesi after drawing 3-3 in Barcelona in the first game. Both sides are full of talents and players that can decide the final at any moment, but let's take a look at the top five players that will feature in the Champions League final this season:\\xa0How to watch the Champions League final, oddsDate: Saturday, May 31 |\\xa0Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Allianz Arena -- Munich, GermanyTV:\\xa0CBS |\\xa0Live stream:\\xa0Paramount+Odds:\\xa0Paris Saint-Germain +105; Draw +240; Inter +2705. GK Yann Sommer, Inter\\xa0It wasn't easy to pick the best goalkeeper, especially considering the incredible performances of PSG player Gianluigi Donnarumma against Liverpool in the round of 16 and then in the quarterfinals against Aston Villa. Yann Sommer been absolutely impressive, especially in the first leg of the Arsenal matchup in London. However, the Swiss goalkeeper showed out, especially against Barcelona in the two-legged semifinals, proving he is one of the best players around Europe. His incredible saves, in particular the one on Lamine Yamal at San Siro in the second leg played in Milan, showed why Inter decided to sign him to replace Andre Onana in the summer of 2023.\\n4. Achraf Hakimi, PSGThe PSG winger played for the Italian side during the 2020-21 season under Antonio Conte, when he was the Inter manager. His impact in the Italian Serie A was outstanding, and his performances led the Nerazzurri to win their first Scudetto in 11 years before PSG decided to sign him in the summer of 2021 for around $70 million, add-ons included. The Nerazzurri, after his departure, replaced him with Dutch winger Denzel Dumfries, who improved a lot and he's now close to the level of Achraf Hakimi, but still not quite there. The Moroccan star can be considered as one of the best players around the world, and he will have the chance to lift the trophy in front of his former teammates and fans after scoring the deciding goal of the semifinals tie against Arsenal in Paris.\\n3. Lautaro Martinez, InterThe Inter captain has been incredible this season, and he also showed why last year as he was named seventh in voting for the Ballon d'Or. Winning the Champions League would be the only trophy he still hasn't won so far in his career, and his quick recovery ahead of the second leg of the semifinals against Barcelona showed how much he wants to achieve it, starting six days after suffering a muscular injury in the match played in Barcelona. Compared to the 2023 final against Manchester City, when he was playing alongside Edin Dzeko and Romelu Lukaku, his new teammate, Marcus Thuram, has helped Lautaro Martinez to improve his goal records and performances.\\n2. Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, PSGKhvicha Kvaratskhelia to PSG has been by far the best signing of the 2025 January transfer window and possibly one of the best ever made in the winter transfer session. The former Napoli winger has been able to prove himself in a very short time in France as well, and since he joined Luis Enrique's team, he scored four goals and provided six assists, but most notably, he was able to show all his talent and quickly gained a starting place in the team. He will be the most talented player on both teams in that game, and he's the one to watch for individual brilliance.\\n1. Ousmane Dembele, PSGThere is one PSG with Ousmane Dembele on the pitch, and there is one without him. If the French winger will be fit at the best of his form in the 2025 final, there is no much Inter can do to contain him, even if the the Nerazzurri were able to face both Lamine Yamal and Raphinha in the semifinals. His numbers this season are absolutely incredible as he already scored 33 goals, 13 assists and has scored one goal every 92 minutes played over the 44 games in all competitions.

The company of Here We Are, Stephen Sondheim’s final musical, are off-book and getting the first act on its feet. But hitting your cues in a show as intricate as this is tough, whoever you are.Jane Krakowski fluffs an entrance and tries not to corpse. Martha Plimpton raises a glass a second after everyone else, and a cast-mate blows a raspberry from the sidelines. Jesse Tyler Ferguson is convinced it’s not him who is a beat off. “Do it exactly like Rory does,” suggests director Joe Mantello, and Rory Kinnear responds mock-haughtily: “That’s just a general note.”Sondheim’s songs can be notoriously tricky to perform. Ferguson, best known for his role as Mitchell in the sitcom Modern Family, found the New York premiere of this work “hypnotic” when he saw it. “And now I realise they spent weeks just learning how to speak these things, and how hard that is.” Combining the verbal rhythmic patterns with the show’s ever-moving choreography is, says Mantello, like patting your head while rubbing your stomach.The good news: after three weeks it is already very funny. Denis O’Hare – he and Tracie Bennett return from the original production – is nailing his scene. Even with 129 performances in the bank, he is still making his director laugh with fresh takes on a desperate-to-please waiter. At the back of the room, awaiting his entrance, a dead chef lies on a trolley, suitably garnished.When Here We Are opened off-Broadway in October 2023 it was the hottest ticket in town (not unlike Mantello’s 2004 Assassins, which won a Tony). A collaboration between Sondheim, Mantello and writer David Ives, it had been in development for seven years when Sondheim died, aged 91, and was completed posthumously. Ferguson and Krakowski both remember watching from the audience feeling wildly jealous of the participants, so being asked to join the show for its London debut was a dream. “And on top of that,” says Ferguson, “it’s at the National Theatre, which is something everyone dreams of doing, certainly as an American. I feel very, very fancy.”‘A loving farewell’... Chumisa Dornford-May in Here We Are. Photograph: Marc BrennerA satirical amalgam of two of Luis Buñuel’s surrealist films, The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie and The Exterminating Angel, the show is about a group of wealthy friends who head out for brunch, only to find themselves caught up in a sequence of absurd situations. “I’ve sort of taken my lead from Buñuel, who said the only explanation is there’s no explanation,” says Mantello. When it starts to snow in the middle of the room, you don’t ask why: “It’s magical.”The characters are symbols of late-capitalist excess – an immoral industrialist, a philandering ambassador, a celebrity plastic surgeon – but their bond of friendship is real. “The secret is, you cast really charming actors,” says Mantello. “You have such affection for these faces when they walk on stage, and maybe just as you start to run out of patience, so does the show.”The music famously runs out before the end, early in the second half. “Sondheim makes people crazy in all kinds of interesting and different ways,” says Ives. “And social media went crazy over whether this show should even go on. Should Mozart’s Requiem not be heard because Süssmayr had to finish some of the writing? Should Lulu by Alban Berg, one of the greatest operas ever written, not go on because Berg died without finishing the third act? I don’t think so.”It needed Mantello’s vision to stage such a technically tricky show, says Ives. “He is a genius at composition. It’s like watching a classical painting, the way they move around.” The last time he felt so fraught before an opening night, he adds, was when he wrote Venus in Fur, and that was based on a pornographic, sadomasochistic novel. “Joe and I just did not know what people were going to make of this,” he says.Instead of opening on Broadway, they mounted the production at The Shed, a 1,200-seater cultural centre in Hudson Yards. “We tried to find a space to fit the oddness of this piece.” The New York Times, which had questioned the play’s readiness to be seen, pivoted after opening night: “cool and impossibly chic”, it was “a worthy and loving farewell”.“People realised that we weren’t there to somehow traduce a Bible or slander Sondheim,” says Ives. “We were there to show people what he had done. And behold, it was good!”‘You never had to ask him a follow-up question’ … Stephen Sondheim in 1997. Photograph: Douglas Elbinger/Getty ImagesKrakowski’s long musical theatre CV includes a first meeting with “Mr Sondheim” when she was 14, playing Fredericka in a production of A Little Night Music. She still remembers the precision of his notes: “You never had to ask him a follow-up question.” Krakowski’s family adored musical theatre – her mother was a drama teacher, her father gave them Sondheim librettos to study on car trips. At 24, she was performing in the first Broadway revival of Company, terrified by the responsibility of holding the alto line. “And now,” jokes 56-year-old Krakowski, “aged 29 …”Ferguson grew up in New Mexico watching the Tony awards and wearing out hard-to-find videotapes of Sweeney Todd and Into the Woods. He remembers missing out on the part of Jack in Into the Woods at the Albuquerque Civic Light Opera, “and bawling, crying so hard because I really was right for the role. I still am.” Krakowski shakes her head: “Let it go, Jesse.”The only time Ferguson met Sondheim was backstage after a production of Merrily We Roll Alongn Foster. “At this point in my career I had met some very, very famous people, but nothing compared to this man who meant so much to me from such an early age.” Intimidated and overwhelmed, all he could say was: “Good job.” He looks at us with a hangdog expression. “Those are the only two words I ever spoke to Stephen Sondheim.”The composer’s loss still felt fresh during the New York production. “I found that very, very moving, that we actually hear the music stop,” says Krakowski, tearing up at the memory. “And David Hyde Pierce did this very subtle thing,” adds Mantello,” where he just looked up for a second, and it was like bringing him into the room. You don’t want it to get sentimental or maudlin or self-conscious, but it was just a breath to say, ‘You were here.’”‘Cool and impossibly chic’ … the production at the Shed in New York. Photograph: no creditMantello’s inventive staging – including restaurant sets that drop from the ceiling – is being faithfully recreated for the Lyttelton at the NT. The cast, meanwhile, are finding new gags. We watch as Plimpton adds a hint of dominatrix to one character – “That’s something she brought to the table,” says Mantello. And this time around, the show’s end-of-the-world undertones may hit even harder.“Politically, we’re in a very different place,” says Ferguson, “where a lot of those fears – not for everyone, but for many people – are here. Some of it is going to make jokes funnier, and some of it is going to make stuff more poignant. There are lines that I cannot believe have been in this script for three years.” One line about Teslas has taken on an entirely new meaning.We discuss Thomas Ostermeier’s recent production of The Seagull, which questioned the value of theatre and literature when you’re faced with apocalypse. “Being a closeted gay kid in Albuquerque, I went to art to heal me and fill me with purpose,” says Ferguson. “Now I’m a father with two kids, and I’m looking at the world that’s being created around them. And what I do to feel like I can protect them is take them to experience art. So if you ask me what are we even doing here – I’m surviving. You know, this is exactly where I should be right now.”Mantello says one of the reasons he’s excited to bring the show to the UK is that he feels British audiences are more inclined to dissect shows in the aftermath. “I’m making a broad generalisation here, but the idea of the play as the beginning of a conversation – that you take it into the bar next door, that you take what you’ve just experienced and sift through it – happens less in America than you’d think.”How long will it take for this play to become part of the Sondheim canon? “Well, it’s in the canon now,” Ives points out. “And you know, how many of his shows were actually well received? All those we think of as classics lasted a week or two. He loved to say to me, ‘It never made any money.’ And as Mantello says, it takes time for people to catch up to him. But we’re just so proud of it, so, here we are.”', 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Sondheim's final musical 'Here We Are' debuts\\nENTITIES: Stephen Sondheim, Joe Mantello, David Ives, Jane Krakowski, Martha Plimpton, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, National Theatre, Luis Buñuel\\nEVENT: The article discusses the production of Stephen Sondheim's final musical, Here We Are, at the National Theatre in London, highlighting the challenges and emotional resonance of completing the work after his death.\\nCONTEXT: Sondheim's final musical, completed posthumously, debuts in London.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 52900, 'sourceId': 12706, 'url': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-14687977/Ruben-Amorim-breaks-silence-Bruno-Fernandes-mega-money-offer-Saudi-Arabia-Al-Hilal-attempt-lure-Man-United-transfer.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490', 'title': \"Ruben Amorim breaks silence on Bruno Fernandes' mega-money offer from Saudi Arabia - as Al Hilal...\", 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T23:11:44.000Z', 'content': \"Ruben Amorim breaks silence on Bruno Fernandes' mega-money offer from Saudi Arabia - as Al Hilal attempt to lure Man United captain in British transfer record deal\\n15:48, 07 May 2025, updated\\n00:11, 08 May 2025\\nBy\\nCHRIS WHEELER\\nAl-Hilal are prepared to break the British transfer record to buy FernandesThe Saudi Pro League side could pay Fernandes around £200m over three years\\xa0LISTEN NOW: It's All Kicking Off!

He is a leader, he’s the captain, so he’s really important. It’s normal that a lot of clubs want a player like Bruno, like (Alejandro) Garnacho, like others. But we want to keep the best players, and Bruno is clearly one of the top players in the world, so our idea didn’t change.

We know this season was really disappointing for everybody. I felt that and still feel this season was the worst, I don’t say in history but in the last 50 years, I don’t know.’Amorim was also asked about Arsene Wenger’s claims over weekend that the Europa League winners should return to the competition the following season rather than gain automatic qualification for the Champions League. He added: ‘I just know the rules. If people want to change the rules by all means, but these are the rules. If you win the Europa League, you go to the Champions League.‘I know the Champions League should be for teams who are champions, or the best team in the league, but they find this way of promoting the (Europa League) competition.

Another suggests building symbolic pathways and a pair of bridges over the lake in the park.The winning entry will be chosen later this year, but there is no date yet set for when the finished memorial will be unveiled. The construction budget will be between £23m and £46m, depending on the selected design, says the Cabinet Office.TSS JFAAn oak tree from Windsor Great Park was the inspiration for this proposalThe public will get a chance to say whether they want a more traditional representation of the late Queen, or something more experimental, in what will become an important London landmark.The new memorial will be placed not too far from statues of the late Queen\\'s parents, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother. Also nearby is the memorial to Queen Victoria outside Buckingham Palace.WILKINSON EYREInterweaving bridges are used in one of the proposed designsThe location for the monument will be a section of St James\\'s Park close to the Mall and across to a bridge over a lake in the park. The entries include plans to landscape and redesign this area and the construction process is expected to mean replacing the current bridge.The memorial scheme will also provide community projects and facilities around the country. This will follow in the tradition of legacy schemes such as the King George V Playing Fields, which saw almost 500 sports grounds opened in memory of the monarch who died in 1936. Many of those playing fields are still in use, dotted around the country.JLL GibbonsA figure of the late Queen on horseback is part of this design for the parkThe public is being encouraged to contribute ideas about the memorial and to give feedback on the shortlisted designs.\"We want public engagement, we want the public to comment on these proposals, because we want them to feel part of it,\" said Baroness Amos, a member of the committee which will select the design to be built.\"So much of what the late Queen was about was meeting people and engaging with them,\" she said.Baroness Amos, a former leader of the House of Lords, said the memorial should be a fitting tribute to the late Queen, who died at the age of 96 after seven decades on the throne.\"This is about an extraordinary woman and an extraordinary reign, about her commitment to public service, her duty, her commitment to the community, to the nation and the Commonwealth,\" she said.The five final teams are: Foster + Partners with Yinka Shonibare and Michel Desvigne PaysagisteHeatherwick Studio with Halima Cassell, MRG Studio, Webb Yates and ArupJ&L Gibbons with Michael Levine RDI, William Matthews Associates, Structure Workshop and ArupTom Stuart-Smith with Jamie Fobert Architects, Adam Lowe (Factum Arte) and Structure WorkshopWilkinsonEyre with Lisa Vandy and Fiona Clark, Andy Sturgeon Design, Atelier One and Hilson Moran', 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Queen Elizabeth Memorial Designs Unveiled for Public Input\\nENTITIES: Queen Elizabeth II, Foster + Partners, Heatherwick Studio, J&L Gibbons, Tom Stuart-Smith, WilkinsonEyre, Baroness Amos\\nEVENT: Final designs revealed for Queen Elizabeth II memorial to be built in St James's Park, London.

It offers excellent battery life and more than enough power for daily tasks at an affordable price. On the other side, the MacBook Pro offers three levels of power to meet the needs of even the most demanding user, more RAM, more storage, longer battery life and a significantly superior display. Those features aren’t cheap though.\\nThere is so much mode to differentiate the different Apple laptop models as you will see if you read on.\\nFor advice about the best MacBook, we also have a buying guide, see: Best MacBook: Which Mac laptop is best?

When Apple introduced the M4 version of the MacBook Air in March 2025 it dropped the price by $100/£100. As a result, the price gap is even larger between the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air.\\nWith no ‘budget’ MacBook Pro available, the MacBook Air is the only option for those looking for a bargain. If you are looking for the cheapest option the $999/£999 MacBook Air would appear to be the clear winner. However, we recommend spending $200/£200 more to get the 10-core CPU/10-core GPU 512GB MacBook Air, which is worth every extra penny.\\nThe price of the MacBook Pro is higher, and on everyday tasks it performs the same as the MacBook Air, but it does offer better performance on long, CPU-intensive tasks, like image and video rendering and similar tasks. Not to mention the better screen, HDMI port, and SDXC Card slot, and more discussed below.

However, to the average person the screen quality of the MacBook Air will be more than sufficient.\\nIt’s not just fewer pixels though. Both Airs have a maximum brightness of 500 nits, which is half of the Pro’s 1,000 nits in normal use, or a third if you’re running HDR content at a max of 1,600 nits of which the MacBook Pro is capable. This is achieved by the Pro display incorporating mini-LEDs rather than the Air’s standard LCD screen.\\nPerhaps the biggest difference though is that the Pro features ProMotion, meaning that the refresh rate tops out at 120Hz, again double that of the Air’s 60Hz refresh rate. This helps keep scrolling and animations smooth and crisp. Any of these displays will be great for everyday use and long hours of work, but the Pro has the edge when it comes to features.\\nAnd there is more. With the M4 MacBook Pro, Apple introduced a nano-texture glass option that has a matte-like finish for $150.\\xa0This option is not available on the MacBook Air, and if you need to cut down the glare from the display, it’s a feature to consider.\\nAll of this is mute if you will plug your Mac into a display, of course, in which case you can buy a display that offers you the screen quality you need.\\n15-inch MacBook Air (left) and 14-inch MacBook Pro.Foundry\\nMacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: Performance Difference\\nThere’s a reason why there is a “Pro” in the name. The MacBook Pro is better suited to pro users, by which we mean creative professionals, graphic designers, photographers, film makers, 3D animators, programmers, and so on. A MacBook Air would be more than sufficient for home users, students, and office workers, but as soon as you start to push it with something more demanding, like movie editing software, or a computer game, you might find it heats up and slows down a bit, at least in comparison to how a MacBook Pro would deal with the dame demands. That’s why we tend to recommend the MacBook Air to those who go beyond the typical user.\\nDespite this, if you are upgrading an old computer, the MacBook Air will feel super speedy whatever you are doing with it.\\nWe have the data below to show just how much better MacBook Pro performance is compared to the MacBook Air.\\nMacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: Processor\\nAll of Apple’s laptops are powered by Apple’s silicon and right now the latest Apple chip is the M4, which comes in the following varieties: M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max. To learn more about all the Mac processors read our Mac processor comparison.\\nWhen it comes to the processor specs the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air actually look pretty well matched, as shown by this table.\\nMacBookPriceCPUGPUMemorySSD13.6-inch MacBook Air, M4 (2025)\\xa0$999/£99910-core, M48-core, M416GB (up to 32GB)256GB SSD13.6-inch MacBook Air, M4 (2025)\\xa0$1,199/£1,19910-core, M410-core, M416GB (up to 32GB)512GB SSD13.6-inch MacBook Air, M4 (2025)\\xa0$1,399/£1,39910-core, M410-core, M424GB (up to 32GB)512GB SSD15-inch MacBook Air, M4 (2025)$1,199/£1,19910-core, M410-core, M416GB (up to 32GB)256GB SSD15-inch MacBook Air, M4(2025)$1,399/£1,39910-core, M410-core, M416GB (up to 32GB)512GB SSD15-inch MacBook Air, M4 (2025)$1,599/£1,59910-core, M410-core, M424GB (up to 32GB)512GB SSD14-inch MacBook Pro, M4 (2024)$1,599/£1,59910-core, M410-core, M416GB (up to 32GB)512GB SSD14-inch MacBook Pro, M4 (2024)$1,799/£1,79910-core, M410-core, M416GB (up to 32GB)1TB SSD14-inch MacBook Pro, M4 (2024)$1,999/£1,99910-core, M410-core, M424GB (up to 32GB)1TB SSDThe specs look similar, but there are factors in the design of the MacBook Pro that will enable the machine to withstand higher power requirements.\\nHowever, there is a difference in terms of how well the processors perform in the different models, as you can see from the Geekbench and Cinebench results below. A similarly specced MacBook Pro performs better than the MacBook Air, albeit only slightly beter.\\nThe M4 15-inch MacBook Air scored 14680 in the multiple CPU Geekbench and 3907 in the GPU test for Cinebench 2024.\\nThe M4 14-inch MacBook Pro scored 14763 in the multiple CPU Geekbench and 3997 in the GPU test for Cinebench 2024.\\nThe M4 Pro 16-inch MacBook Pro scored 22406 in the multiple CPU Geekbench and 9297 in the GPU test for Cinebench 2024.\\nThe chart below shows the Geekbench results for the various processors.\\nThe MacBook Air is slower because in order for it to be so compact it is fanless, which means it is less able to manage heat, and therefore may run slower in order to keep cool if you really push it. If it’s power you need then, as the benchmarks show, a MacBook Pro will have the edge.\\nHowever, that’s not to say that the M4 MacBook Air is slow. As you can see from the scores above, the M4 shoots ahead of the M3, M2 and M1, in fact it even scores above the M3 Pro. The M4 MacBook Air is plenty powerful enough for most people, and likely way better than any old Mac you are replacing.\\nIf you really need a powerful machine you might want to consider the M4 Pro MacBook Pro.\\nIf you need to push your Mac with graphic-intensive apps a MacBook Pro would be a better choice.Foundry\\nMacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: RAM (unified memory)\\nPrior to October 2024, many Macs shipped with just 8GB RAM as standard. These days a Mac may struggle with just 8GB RAM so Apple has upped this allocation, and since October 2024 all MacBook Air and MacBook Pro ship with at least 16GB RAM as standard. There is an option to increase unified memory to 24GB or 32GB in the M4 MacBook Pro and Air.\\nIf you need more memory you will need to look to the MacBook Pro with M4 Pro or M4 Max. With the M4 Pro you can get up to 48GB unified memory, while the M4 Max can support up to 128GB memory.\\nOur advice is to get as much RAM as you can afford when you buy the Mac, as you can’t upgrade it later.\\nMacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: Storage\\nApple offers a 256GB storage option at the entry-level for both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air. The entry-level MacBook Pro starts at 512GB. There is the option to add 1TB or 2TB SSD to both laptops.\\nWhile a 2556GB SSD might prove to be enough for you, especially if you use iCloud or other cloud based services to supplement your storage. But 512GB might be a better option, as we found, see: Here’s proof that a 256GB SSD is too small for a Mac in 2025.\\nAnother reason to avoid the 256GB model: in previous generations, there were some concerns about this 256GB SSD, with reports that its SSD is up to 50 percent slower on read speeds and 30 percent on write speeds. We found that these observations were indeed true when we ran our own set of tests using Blackmagic Disk Speed Test on older MacBook models. In more recent times, this has seemed to be less of an issue. This will only matter if you are using apps that access the SSD often, so it may not make a difference in typical use.\\nIf you want more than 2TB SSD you need to look at the MacBook Pro models with the M4 Pro and M4 Max which can support up to 8TB SSD.\\nMacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: Design\\n15-inch MacBook Air (left) and 14-inch MacBook Pro (right).Foundry\\nFollowing a redesign of the MacBook Air in June 2022, you could have been forgiven for thinking you were looking at a MacBook Pro. Gone is the tapered edge for which the Air was famous, replaced with a more uniform design. The MacBook Air is still thinner – albeit fractionally – but it is also very slightly larger than the old version of the Air, thanks to the bigger screen.\\nBoth the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro have a notch at the top of the screen as see on some iPhone models. It’s not a bad thing, but some people don’t like notches. The notch conceals the FaceTime camera, which, with the introduction of the M4 MacBook Air, is now the same 12MP Center Stage camera with support for Desk View and 1080p HD video recording on all models.\\nDespite the presence of the iPhone-like notch, MacBooks do not offer Face ID for unlocking. Instead all MacBook’s have a Touch ID sensor built into the keyboard, so you can just tap your finger on there to unlock things and enter passwords.\\nEugen Wegmann\\nOne key difference between these MacBooks is the color choices. There are four color choices for the 13-inch MacBook Air and the 15-inch MacBook Air: Midnight (dark blue), Starlight (gold), Sky Blue and Silver. Apple introduced the Sky Blue option with the M4 MacBook Air and discontinued the Space Gray option (to the dismay of some). The Starlight shade is paler gold, while Midnight is close to black with a dark blue hue.\\nThe 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro offer only Silver and Space Black options.\\nMacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: Dimensions\\nFoundry\\nApple refers to them as the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air and the 14-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro. The measurements are based on the screen size, but those numbers are actually not accurate. Here’s what the real screen measurements are:\\nThe screen on the 13-inch MacBook Air measures 13.6-inches diagonally.\\nThe screen on the 15-inch MacBook Air measures 15.3-inches diagonally.\\nThe screen on the 14-inch MacBook Pro measures 14.2-inches diagonally.\\nThe screen on the 16-inch MacBook Pro measures 16.2-inches diagonally.\\nA larger display doesn’t necessarily mean the Mac is bigger and heavier though. The 15-inch Air is thinner, so it not only weighs less than the 16-inch MacBook Pro, it is also lighter than the 14-inch MacBook Pro due to the fans needed for heat dissipation in the more powerful machine.\\n16-inch MacBook Pro, M4 Pro: 4.7 pounds (2.14 kg), M4 Max: 4.7 pounds (2.15 kg)\\n14-inch MacBook Pro, M4 Pro: 3.5 pounds (1.60 kg), M4 Max: 3.6 pounds (1.62 kg)\\n14-inch MacBook Pro, M4: 3.4 pounds (1.55 kg)\\n15-inch MacBook Air, M4: 3.3 pounds (1.51 kg)\\n13-inch MacBook Air, M4: 2.7 pounds (1.24 kg)\\nFrom the figures above, you’ll notice that the M4 Pro and M4 Max models weigh a little bit more than the M4 MacBook Pro.\\nAnd as you can see from the below, the 13-inch MacBook Air dimensions aren’t much smaller than those of the 14-inch MacBook Air. Given that there is actually only half an inch (0.6in) difference in screen size, this shouldn’t be surprising.\\n16-inch MacBook Pro, M4: 14.01 x 9.77 x 0.66 inches (35.57 x 24.81 x 1.68cm)\\n15-inch MacBook Air, M4: 13.40 x 9.35 x 0.45 inches (34.04 x 23.76 x 1.15cm)\\n14-inch MacBook Pro, M4: 12.31 x 8.71 x 0.61 inches (31.26 x 22.12 x 1.55cm)\\n13-inch MacBook Air, M4: 11.97 x 8.46 x 0.44 inches (30.41 x 21.5 x 1.13cm)\\nThe MacBook Air (bottom) is thinner than the MacBook Pro (top).Apple\\nMacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: Battery life and charging\\nThe MacBook Air ships with a braided MagSafe cable and compact dual-USB-C Power Adapter.IDG\\nWhen it comes to battery life, according to Apple, the MacBook Air offers 18 hours battery life when video streaming, while the 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro offers an 24 hours video streaming. The main reason for this difference is that the 14-inch MacBook Pro has a larger battery: 72.4 watt-hours compared to 66.5 watt-hours in the 15-inch MacBook Air and 53.8 watt-hours in the 13-inch Air. The battery in the 16-inch MacBook Pro is even bigger at 100 watt-hours.\\nMacBook Air, 13-inch, M4, 18 hours battery life (Apple)\\nMacBook Air, 15-inch, M4, 18 hours battery life (Apple), 1,076 minutes, just under 18 hours (our test)\\nMacBook Pro, 14-inch, M4, 24 hours battery life (Apple), 20 hours (our test)\\nMacBook Pro, 14-inch, M4 Pro/M4 Max, 22 hours battery life (Apple)\\nMacBook Pro, 16-inch, M4 Pro/M4 Max, 24 hours battery life (Apple), 26 hours (our test)\\nIt’s not just how long the battery lasts that matters, but also the charging speed. The entry-level 13-inch MacBook Air ships with a 30W adapter, the other 13-inch Air and the 15-inch MacBook Air ship with a 35W power adapter. The 14-inch MacBook Pro M4, and the entry-level M4 Pro ships with a 70W adapter, the other 14-inch MAcBook Pro models offer a 96W charger, and the 16-inch model has a 140W adapter for even faster charging.\\nEach 14-inch MacBook Pro can also be fast charged with a 96W adapter (only included with some models) and the MacBook Air can be fast charged with a 70W adapter (not included). See our comparison test of Apple’s MacBook Air chargers as well as the best USB-C charger for your MacBook.\\nMacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: Ports and expansion\\nOver the years it’s felt like Apple has been on a mission to remove ports from Macs in order to make them slimmer and slimmer. This has been a disadvantage for many, although generally if you need more or different ports you can just plug in an adapter or a dock (read: Best USB-C hubs and adapters for Mac).\\nThe MacBook Air offers a MagSafe charging port alongside two Thunderbolt 4/USB-C ports.\\nThe MacBook Pro offers an additional Thunderbolt 4/USB-C port, as well as HDMI and SDXC ports.\\nThe arrival of Thunderbolt 4 for this generation means that the M4 MacBooks can support more displays. See: How to connect two or more external displays to an M1, M2, M3 or M4 MacBook.\\nConnectivity for both models is via Bluetooth 5.3 and Wi-Fi 6E. All Mac laptops offer a 3.5mm headphone jack.\\nThe MacBook Air with MagSafe as well as two USB/Thunderbolt ports compared to the 2020 M1 MacBook Air.IDG\\nMacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: Audio and camera\\nAll of the MacBooks in the current generation offer a 12MP Center Stage camera that automatically keeps the user in the center of the frame. The camera also supports Desk View, which can show the desk space in front of the laptop. This is an upgrade from the M3 MacBooks, which only offered a 1080p FaceTime camera.\\nThe 15-inch MacBook Air has a benefit over the 13-inch MacBook Air model: if features a six-speaker sound system with force-canceling woofers, compared to a four-speaker sound system. Apple describes the speaker system in the 14-inch MacBook Pro as a high-fidelity six-speaker sound system with force-cancelling woofers, indicating that it is superior to that in the 15-inch Air. Apple also refers to a “studio-quality three-mic array with high signal-to-noise ratio and directional beamforming” in the 14-inch Pro, while both Air models offer only a “three-mic array with directional beamforming”.\\nThe MacBook Pro has a better speaker system than the MacBook Air: six-speaker arrays rather than a four-speaker sound system. The sound on the MacBook Pro is described by Apple as “High Fidelity,” by which we assume Apple is indicating it is superior to the Air.\\nMacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: Buying advice\\nSo which MacBook should you choose? If you are on a budget it has to be the MacBook Air and you won’t be disappointed. If you need a bit more power than the Air can offer, and a better quality display, the M4 MacBook Pro will see you good. But if you need even more power you’ll have to fork out for the M4 Pro or M4 Max MacBook Pro models.\\nIf one factor that is important to you is the screen size, the 15-inch MacBook Air will give you a larger screen for less money than the 14-inch MacBook Pro. Just be aware that screen quality is not as good as that on the more expensive model. Of course, if you are going to plug your Mac into an external display whenever you are at your desk this shouldn’t be a decision breaker. See our round-up of the best displays for Mac.\\nIf it’s display quality that matters, the XDR, ProMotion display of the MacBook Pro will meet your needs. There is also the option of a non-glossy Nano-texture display with the MacBook Pro that doesn’t exist for the Air.\\nWe recommend getting the best machine you can afford at the time of purchase because you won’t be able to upgrade down the line.

It reportedly contained photos of girls Among the materials reportedly found was a hard drive containing photographs believed to be taken in Portugal, thought to be crucial in persuading investigators that Madeleine died shortly after her disappearance in May 2007.A laptop was also handed to police, the Sun reported, thought to contain vital information linking Brueckner to the case.Police are also said to have discovered a stash of USB sticks and memory cards buried beneath the body of Brueckner\\'s dead dog, which was buried at the disused factory.The storage devices are alleged to have contained thousands of files, including images of child abuse, stories detailing fantasies of abducting young girls, and records of Skype chats with other paedophiles.\\xa0One story reported by The Sun described drugging a mother and daughter outside a pre-school and abusing a four-year-old blonde girl.\\xa0These materials are believed to be among the cache that led investigators to believe that Brueckner was involved in Madeleine\\'s disappearance and death.Further searches of the compound are reported to have revealed over 75 children\\'s swimming costumes, toys, small bikes, and masks.\\xa0Three unlicensed firearms and ammunition were also said to have been found, along with bottles of substances suspected to be chloroform or ether - chemicals that can cause unconsciousness.The Sun also reported that a satellite navigation device seized by police traced Brueckner\\'s movements in the Algarve, including the Arade Dam, approximately 35 miles from where Madeleine vanished in Praia da Luz.Pictures of Brueckner posing at the dam were also reportedly found - including a bizarre nude selfie in which he had crudely drawn a balaclava-esque mask over his face.\\xa0 Bottles and substances found inside a Jaguar matching the description of Brueckner\\'s vehicle Among the items found in the bolthole in Neuwegersleben were 75 child\\'s swimming costumes This laptop was reported to have been handed to German police and allegedly contains information that could link Brueckner to Madeleine\\'s disappearance Police recovered three black-market guns and ammunition - alongside bottles of substances suspected to be chloroform or ether, both of which can cause unconsciousness An insurance document reportedly proves for the first time Brueckner was at a festival in March 2008 where he allegedly all but confessed to killing Madeleine Police later searched areas around the Arade Dam in 2023, removing materials later sent to German authorities. Two members of the Metropolitan Police also attended the search, according to a Freedom of Information response.\\xa0It is unclear whether any of the material found in Portugal two years ago has ultimately yielded fresh evidence of Brueckner\\'s alleged involvement in her disappearance.However, an insurance claim signed by Brueckner, among the cache reported by the Sun, indicates he was at a festival in Orgiva, Spain, in early 2008, where he allegedly told a friend that Madeleine \\'did not scream\\'.The insurance document suggests he crashed his Winnebago at a petrol station in the town on March 20 that year. The festival ran from March 21 to 23, according to archive listings.That claim originated in a letter written by Brueckner wrote from prison after being convicted of rape, revealed by the Mail in 2023, in which he attacked the account of a key informant, Helge Busching.Busching had told German authorities in 2017 that Brueckner had \\'made a comment about the missing girl\\' at a \\'hippy festival\\' in Spain in 2008 - and later relayed the claims to national tabloid Bild.He had said: \\'Christian asked me if I was still going to Portugal.\\'I replied: \"I\\'m no longer going to Portugal because there are too many problems there, Portugal has too many police for me on account of the missing child.\\'\"It is indeed strange that she disappeared without a trace.\"\\xa0\\'Christian replied: \"Yes, she did not scream.\"\\'Brueckner has described the account as \\'not even worthy of comment\\' and has denied any involvement in Madeleine McCann\\'s disappearance. Questions also remain over Busching\\'s account. A photograph thought to show Christian\\xa0Brueckner at the Arade Dam - a key location in the Madeleine McCann investigation which Portuguese police searched in 2023 German police unearthed the disturbing cache of materials at a former box-making factory owned by Bruecker (pictured in 2020) Plastic boxes, electronics and a bathtub dumped outside Brueckner\\'s run-down bolthole Police are seen searching areas around the Arade Dam in Portugal in May 2023 A police tent in the Arade Dam area. Materials were sent to German authorities for further analysis but it is not known if any decisive evidence was found Brueckner is likely to walk free from prison later this year unless prosecutors are able to conclusively charge him German prosecutors have stated for years that they believe Brueckner is responsible for the youngster\\'s death.They have previously disclosed that mobile phone location data puts Brueckner in Praia da Luz on the night Madeleine disappeared.\\xa0In 2020,\\xa0German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters told Australian news programme 60 Minutes, which said 8,000 pieces of evidence had been found at the factory: \\'We have strong evidence that Madeleine McCann is dead and that our suspect killed her.\\'We don\\'t have the body and no parts of the body, but we have enough evidence to say our suspect killed Madeleine McCann.\\'He added at the time that he had written to Madeleine\\'s parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, stating as much.\\'The parents have been told the German police have evidence that she is dead but we have not told them the details,\\' he said.Despite these findings, German prosecutors have yet to charge Brueckner in connection with Madeleine\\'s disappearance.\\xa0Brueckner is currently serving seven years for raping an elderly American woman in the Algarve the year before Madeleine disappeared and he is due to be released later this year.Prosecutors are seeking a retrial over separate rape claims for which he was acquitted late last year.\\xa0If that fails, they will then seek an appeal, but Brueckner\\'s lawyers have told MailOnline it \\'only has a ten per cent chance of succeeding\\'.Just last month MailOnline revealed that the budget for detectives investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann had been slashed.They have been granted a further £108,000 to carry on the search for her - a drop of £84,000 on the amount awarded last year.The money was approved in April following a request from the Metropolitan Police\\'s Operation Grange team who were specifically tasked with finding the toddler.With the latest £108,000 Operation Grange has spent almost £13.5million investigating the case – prompting some to question whether it is viable considering no arrests or charges have been made.The money comes from a special Home Office fund and is reviewed annually with Operation Grange making a request which is submitted and then considered.Last week marked the 18th anniversary of her disappearance on May 3, and also her 22nd birthday - but there has been no real breakthrough in the hunt. Kate and Gerry McCann, Madeleine\\'s parents, hold pyjamas similar to those of their daughter during a press conference in June 2007 Brueckner is serving seven years for raping an elderly American woman in the Algarve the year before Madeleine disappeared Prosecutors insist Madeleine is dead but are yet to disclose evidence supporting this theory Police standing outside the Ocean Club hotel village on May 4, 2007, a day after Madeleine was reported missing Gerry and Kate McCann hold a picture of Madeleine as they make an appeal from the holiday apartment days after she disappeared In a heart-rending statement, Kate and Gerry McCann restated their unwavering commitment to finding out the truth of what has happened to their daughter.It read: \\'As we arrive at the 18th anniversary of Madeleine\\'s abduction, we\\'d like to thank our faithful supporters once again for standing by us and never forgetting about Madeleine.\\'The years appear to be passing even more quickly and whilst we have no significant news to share, our determination to \"leave no stone unturned\" is unwavering. We will do our utmost to achieve this.\\'May is also the month which includes International Missing Children\\'s Day (25th).\\xa0\\'We continue to remember all missing children and their families, both here in the UK and abroad, thinking especially of all the children displaced from their homes & families in Ukraine and Gaza at this time.\\'We\\'re very grateful to the UK charity Missing People for their ongoing, invaluable work, and to all organisations, charities and police forces who remain committed, despite many challenges and limited resources, to finding & bringing home the many missing and abducted children. \\'May is also Madeleine\\'s birthday - her 22nd this year.

The Hang Seng in Hong Kong gained only 0.1% by the end of trading, closing at 22,691.88. The Shanghai Composite index rose 0.8% to 3,342.67. The trade talks may account for the decision to announce the economic rescue package, Lynne Song of ING Economics said in a report. “This way, the easing won’t be seen as a knee-jerk reaction to tariffs. Policymakers are likely now privy to some of the early data on how the economy is being impacted by the tariff shock,” Song said. But analysts said the muted response to the policies announced Wednesday also may reflect disappointment over the lack of major government spending increases that many economists say may be needed to wrest the Chinese economy out of its doldrums. “These will help to shore up growth at the margin. But any boost to credit demand will be modest and today’s moves are no substitute for an expansion in fiscal support,\" Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a report.

Palantir’s stock’s price remains near $110, when it was sitting at only $20 less than a year ago. Uncertainty around tariffs has made U.S. households more pessimistic about the economy and could affect their long-term plans for purchases. That uncertainty has helped fuel a surge in imports ahead of potentially more severe tariffs ahead. The U.S. trade deficit soared to a record $140.5 billion in March as consumers and businesses alike tried to get ahead of tariffs that went into effect in April and others that have been postponed until July. Last week, the government reported the U.S. economy shrank at a 0.3% annual pace during the first quarter of the year because of a surge in imports.Some companies say they’re already seeing impacts to their business from the uncertainty created by tariffs.DoorDash fell 7.4% after reporting weaker revenue than analysts expected for the latest quarter.Also early Wednesday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.32% from 4.31% late Tuesday.U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 54 cents to $59.63 per barrel.

One of the locals asked 'Why would you go there?' And they told me who it was run by,' he said.\\xa0It turns out the café is run by The Twelve Tribes, which was founded in Tennessee and expanded to Australia in the 1990s.\\xa0Those working in the café live in nearby Balmoral House while the rest are at a farm near Picton, about 90 minutes south-west of Sydney.The cult has been accused of child abuse and child labour as well as forcing its members to live by authoritarian rules. It is not suggested there is any truth to the accusations. Mr Hammond (pictured) said he 'felt guilty' for 'accidentally supporting a cult' The Yellow Deli Cafe is a popular spot on Katoomba's main street (customers pictured) In 2019, Andrew McLeod, who then managed the cafe and is an original member of the Australian branch of the group,\\xa0said allegations of child abuse and child labour were untrue.'We want our children to have a well-balanced life and what we do and our beliefs have somehow been taken out of context to portray us as a fundamentalist cult that bashes our children, which is just not true,' he said.'It's sad that so many people are gullible enough to believe what they believe without looking into it themselves.'Mr Hammond shared a video on TikTok about the encounter, admitting he 'felt guilty' for 'accidentally supporting a cult'.'Went into the Yellow Deli in Katoomba thinking, “Wow, what a wholesome little café — handmade furniture, herbal tea, peaceful vibes…,” he captioned the clip.'Turns out it’s run by The Twelve Tribes, which is less “hippie commune” and more “actual cult with some seriously wild beliefs.”'I was just out here vibing with my sandwich, meanwhile unknowingly funding the end times. Honestly though… great eggs 9/10. Would escape again.'The viral clip was flooded with comments from locals and visitors who had also innocently come across the establishment.\\xa0On reflection, Mr Hammond suggested his tattoos may have caused his less-than-friendly reception, having since heard similar experiences of others who have visited the cafe.\\xa0 The expat said he 'can't complain about the food' but would not return to the cafe as 'it's not something I would support'.The cafe declined to comment when contacted by Daily Mail Australia.What is the Twelves Tribes? The cult began in 1975 in Chattanooga, Tennessee, when former carnival showman Gene Spriggs broke away from the\\xa0First Presbyterian Church after finding services were cancelled for the Super Bowl.He and his wife Marsha earlier opened the first Yellow Deli a few years earlier and were living communally with a small group from 1972.Twelve Tribes practices a hybrid of pre-Catholic Christianity and Judaism mixed with teachings by Spriggs.The group's stated aim is to bring about the return of Jesus - whom they refer to by the Hebrew name Yahshua - by reestablishing the 12 tribes of Israel. Twelve Tribes practices a hybrid of pre-Catholic Christianity and Judaism mixed with teachings by its founder, Gene Spriggs All members are forced to sell their possessions and give to proceeds to the cult and are assigned a Hebrew name discard their old ones. Spriggs himself is known as\\xa0Yoneq.\\xa0These tribes would include 144,000 'perfect male children', which accounts for the group's obsessive and controversial child-rearing practices.The Sabbath is observed in line with Jewish tradition, along with conservative dietary rules and abstinence from alcohol, tobacco, and drugs.Birth control of any kind is banned, as is much modern medicine - they instead rely largely on homeopathy and 'natural' remedies.Marriage outside the cult is forbidden and couples must go through a series of supervised talks to get to know each other. Only after marriage can they even kiss or hold hands. These tribes would include 144,000 'perfect male children', which accounts for the group's obsessive and controversial child-rearing practices Children aren't allowed to play with toys, engage in make-believe, or any of the normal childhood activities, and must be supervised at all times.They must be strictly obedient and are beaten with a 50cm rod for every infraction by any adult watching them, not just their parents.All children are homeschooled and do not attend university as it is considered a waste of time and not a good environment.Instead, children work in the community from a young age, sparking accusations of child labour.Estée Lauder and other businesses cut ties with the organisation after finding children were involved in making their products.\\xa0 The few boxes of pamphlets would be easily missed or glossed over by the vast majority of visitors Members don't vote and are not allowed to watch TV or any other media as 'the crazy box robs your time and pollutes your soul'.\\xa0Twelve Tribes has 3,000 members and operates in the U.S., Canada, France, Spain, Argentina, Brazil, Germany and England, arriving in Australia in the early 1990s.Members live in Balmoral House in Katoomba, Peppercorn Creek Farm near Picton, and a small number in Coledale, north of Wollongong.Numerous businesses include a network of cafes in every country, all called the Yellow Deli or Common Ground, and bakeries, farms, and furniture, construction, and demolition businesses.These are believed to be very profitable because none of the workers need to be paid.\", 'location': 'AUS', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Tourist unknowingly supports cult-run Australian cafe\\nENTITIES: Tom Hammond, The Yellow Deli Cafe, The Twelve Tribes, Australia\\nEVENT: A British tourist unknowingly ate at a cafe run by a controversial religious cult, The Twelve Tribes, in the Blue Mountains, Australia.\\nCONTEXT: Tourist warns others about cult-run cafe in Australia.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 53902, 'sourceId': 12816, 'url': 'https://www.foxsports.com.au/ufc/ufc-2025-robert-whittaker-on-next-ufc-fight-renier-de-ridder-rumours-prediction-for-ufc-315-jack-della-maddalena-vs-belal-muhammad/news-story/db1e27bde7a0033f94bde1b5922454ef', 'title': '‘It’s bulls***’: Aussie’s ducking claims blasted amid UFC title ‘kill shot’ prediction', 'publishDate': '2025-05-08T05:58:00.000Z', 'content': 'Robert Whittaker reckons Australia will crown its third UFC champion via “kill shot” this Sunday - while also opening up on his own chances of headlining Down Under and “bulls***” ducking claims.

Sports.The prediction comes six years after Bobby Knuckles became Australia’s first UFC champion, and with rumours swirling he could be set to fight rising Dutch star Renier de Ridder as soon as International Fight Week in July.While Whittaker stressed late on Wednesday afternoon that no contracts have been signed, the fighter also suggested the UFC may also be saving him for his first Australian appearance in 2019 – when beaten by Israel Adesanya for the middleweight crown.Elsewhere, Whittaker also confirmed that he has either requested, or accepted, UFC fight offers against a host of potential rivals in recent weeks – among them Sean Strickland, Caio Borralho and Roman Dolidze.Over the past 24 hours, there have also been reports suggesting the former champ is being offered breakout Dutch prospect de Ridder, who is himself fresh off a huge win over American phenom Bo Nickal.When it comes to who the Sydneysider faces next, Whittaker’s agent Titus Day also hit back at recent claims from Borralho that the Australian was ducking him, branding the suggestion “bulls***”.Whittaker relives UFC championship win | 02:42Yet more immediately, our first UFC champ wanted to chat about the Perth native who could be next.With Whittaker convinced JDM can become the nation’s latest belt holder, and only weeks after Alexander Volkanovski reclaimed his UFC featherweight crown.While Maddalena is as wide as $3 with some bookmakers, Whittaker insists the former schoolboy rugby star will shock in Sunday’s championship bout.Asked how JDM wins, the former champ started: “It’s tricky because Belal, he’s really good at turning bouts into dog fights.“That’s where he thrives.“And so to win, Jack must embrace that.“Then, mate, he just needs to bide his time.“As we saw in his last fight against Gilbert Burns, Jack is so good at finding those moments that change big fights … then finding the kill shot.“And I feel like if he bides his time, stays patient, embraces the dogfight, he’s then got 25 minutes to find that moment to take the belt.”While Muhammad is tipped to try and win the fight grappling, Whittaker surprisingly suggested the champ would “likely have more success standing”.“Because wrestling takes it out of you,” he explained. “And Jack is no chump on the ground.“So apart from there being danger when Belal tries to take Jack down, it’ll also wear him out.“And again, as we saw in the Burns fight, Jack fought through adversity and then still had kill shot potential at the very end of round three.“So it may be safer for Belal to stand and bang.”\"I\\'m going to do your boy dirty!\" | 04:49And as for JDM keeping that “kill shot” potential through five rounds of a title fight?“Definitely, he can,” Whittaker insisted.“Before that Gilbert Burns fight, I would’ve had a different outlook.“But that fight really opened my eyes.“While I always knew how good Jack was, it was that performance where he really displayed a certain X-factor.”Currently sitting at No.5 in the UFC middleweight rankings, Whittaker is himself coming off a nasty first-round loss to Khamzat Chimaev at UFC 308 – with the Aussie tapping to a face crank that seriously damaged his teeth and jaw.Seven months on and Whittaker still doesn’t know who he will fight next, or where.Overnight, there were reports linking ‘The Reaper’ to de Ridder as soon as UFC 317 in late June.Other whispers include a Perth Fight Night card in July, or suggestions Dana White could bring a Pay-Per-View card Down Under at the back end of this year to be headlined by Maddalena’s first title defence should he win.For Whittaker, an Australian bout would represent his first on homesoil since losing UFC middleweight gold to Adesanya in 2019.Since then, one of Australia’s most popular athletes has fought four times in America, three in Abu Dhabi, plus one each in Paris and Saudi Arabia.“And I’ve heard rumours of an Australian card in Perth (this July),” he said.“So maybe they’re holding me out for that.“We’ll have to wait and see.“Certainly, I’d love to fight here again.”\\'Jack can win at any moment!\\' | 02:27But as for an opponent?“Initially, I was asking for Strickland because I thought the fight made sense,” said the fighter“Especially with our respective timelines.“But I know the UFC have a few moving pieces right now and, while they haven’t locked me in for anything, they’ve still come to me with a few names.“(Laughs) It’s basically been everyone and their friend who didn’t have a fight locked in.“And I’ve said yes for all of them.“My goal is to win that belt back.“To make my way back up there and get that title shot again.”Whittaker’s agent Day also shot down suggestions from rising Brazilian star Borralho that the former champ was ducking him.“Because we actually approached the UFC about fighting Caio,” Day stressed.“But we got nothing back.“It was the same when we first asked about Strickland.“Then we were approached by the UFC about Dolidze and said ‘yes’, but there has been nothing regarding Borralho … the idea we’re ducking him is bulls***”.” While Team Whittaker were unavailable for comment on Thursday regarding de Ridder, it is understood that no deal has yet been struck for who the former champ fights next – or where.Asked if he was frustrated by the delay, Whittaker continued: “Yeah, it’s frustrating to be on the sidelines but I realise things and tricky.“And this is the nature of the beast, right?“And not the first time it’s happened, either.“But I never really complain or ask for too much when it comes to who I fight.“I just like to control the date.“I feel that’s my tradeoff.“And for me, getting things finalised is important.“To get into the gear I need to, I like a name and a date.”',

GlobalP/Getty ImagesScientists have made a potent antivenom using antibodies from a man who has been bitten hundreds of times by venomous snakes. The therapy protects mice against the venoms of 19 species of deadly snake, including the king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah).The antivenom combines the existing drug varespladib with antibodies that are copies of those in the blood of Tim Friede, a US snake collector who has given himself more than 600 doses of venom to build up his immunity. He has also been bitten roughly 200 times by venomous snakes. The antivenom is reported today in a paper in Cell.Scientists say that the research could lead to direly needed treatments, but that its reliance on material from a person who performed dangerous experiments on himself makes it ethically murky. The paper’s authors say they played no part in Friede’s self-exposure to venom. “We did not advise Friede to do this and no one else needs to do this again — we have all the molecules we need,” says co-author Jacob Glanville, chief executive of biomedical firm Centivax in South San Francisco, California. “Snake venom is dangerous,” he adds, and he cautions people not to follow Friede’s example.On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

Each antivenom protects against the venom of at most a few species.“Considering the advanced technologies available in immunology today, it is unacceptable to continue relying on these outdated methods for treating snake bites,” says Kartik Sunagar, a biologist who develops antivenoms at the Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru.The paper’s authors sought to make an antivenom that would protect against a wide range of the world’s 600-plus venomous snake species. As a start, the team focused on the Elapidae family, which includes nearly half of those species. Elapid venom contains peptides called short-chain neurotoxins (SNX) and long-chain neurotoxins (LNX). Both types of peptide bind to the same receptors on nerve cells, impairing communication between neurons and potentially causing muscle paralysis and respiratory failure.Don’t try this at homeGlanville and his co-author Peter Kwong, a biochemist at Columbia University in New York City, had read news coverage about Friede, who took careful notes about his venom exposure. After receiving approval from an ethics review board, getting informed consent from Friede, and supplying him with documents about the dangers of snake venom, the team collected two vials of Friede’s blood. They isolated antibodies from it and tested them against a panel of toxins from elapid snakes. Antibodies that bound to the toxins were then tested in mice that had been dosed with snake venom. Seeking to add protection against even more species, the researchers tested a third element: varespladib, which inhibits a snake-venom enzyme that breaks down muscle and nerve tissue.Antibodies from snake collector Tim Friede, here with a water cobra (Hydrodynastes gigas), have been used to make a broad-spectrum antivenom.CentivaxThey found that a cocktail made up of varespladib and two antibodies from Friede allowed mice to survive otherwise lethal doses of venom from any one of 19 species of dangerous elapid snakes. One of the antibodies binds to a molecular feature shared by toxins in the LNX family. The other binds to a feature shared by toxins in the SNX family.Glanville says that exact copies of human antibodies could pose less risk of adverse reactions than those based on animal antibodies and broad-spectrum synthetic antibodies designed with computational approaches.Sunagar and other scientists expressed concerns about the ethics of this research, because of the risks Friede took. But he also says that the study is well executed, and shows that combinations of small-molecule drugs such as varespladib and monoclonal antibodies — copies of human antibodies — hold promise. However, it’s not clear whether these antibodies can be produced at an industrial scale for an affordable price, he says.Jean-Philippe Chippaux, a specialist in venomous-snake bites and an emeritus researcher at the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development in Paris, says that the main challenge in addressing snake bite is not the efficacy of the treatments, but the fact that they are often administered too late. “We need to think about ways to bring antivenoms closer to the areas where venomous snake bites occur and to convince patients to come to the hospital more quickly,” he says. “There is no reason to believe that the new generation of broad-spectrum antibodies will achieve these results.”Glanville says he is thinking about ways to make these therapies more portable and affordable. He also says it’s important to provide proof that the cocktail works in the real world before initiating any human trials.Centivax is planning to test the experimental cocktail in dogs bitten by snakes in Australia. Dogs will first be given the experimental treatment; if it doesn’t work after a few minutes, they will receive conventional antivenom.This article is reproduced with permission and was first published on May 2, 2025.\", 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Human antibodies create potent broad-spectrum antivenom\\nENTITIES: Tim Friede, Jacob Glanville, Centivax, Peter Kwong, Columbia University\\nEVENT: Scientists created a potent antivenom using antibodies from a man repeatedly bitten by venomous snakes, protecting mice against 19 deadly species.\\nCONTEXT: New antivenom combines existing drug with human-derived antibodies.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 47770, 'sourceId': 917, 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2025/may/07/fox-chase-boy-standup-comedy-confronts-trauma-in-a-catholic-community', 'title': 'Fox Chase Boy: standup comedy confronts trauma in a Catholic community', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T10:05:14.000Z', 'content': 'There is surprising nostalgia and humour in Gerad Argeros’s story of healing after child abuse by a Catholic priest.

The firm will also not have to pay the contributions. The deal will be reciprocal for British workers transferred to workplaces in India.Officials have not provided an assessment of the cost or impact on UK businesses.The change is understood to have been a key demand by New Delhi’s negotiators who said the agreement, which has been three years in the making, will result in ‘significant financial gains’ for Indian companies.The deal will also see the UK lower tariffs on clothes, shoes and food such as frozen prawns from the subcontinent, in exchange for reciprocal cuts for products including whisky and cars.But the tax break – omitted from the UK press release on the pact – immediately provoked anger.Grim figures yesterday revealed the UK’s services sector had shrunk for the first time in 18 months, blamed on the NI increase – which came into force in April – and Donald Trump’s trade war.Tory business spokesman Harriett Baldwin told the Commons: ‘This Government is literally putting up taxes for British workers, but cutting them for Indian workers.

It is nothing short of a betrayal of working people in this country.’Defending the deal, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds pointed to equivalent agreements with the EU, the US and South Korea under the Double Contribution Convention.‘It means that when our people are moved by a company to India they will be paying into the UK system and not the Indian system, and when Indian people are temporarily in the UK they’ll be paying into their system and not to ours,’ he said. ‘But it’s very specific as to who this applies to.’But Tory MP Nick Timothy said ministers were ‘conning’ the public, adding: ‘These changes will create a massive incentive for UK firms to work with Indian service providers, undercutting domestic workers, companies and contractors.’ Reform leader Nigel Farage said: ¿In Starmer¿s Britain, people who have grown up here, worked hard, paid their taxes and propped up the economy are effectively being asked to pay to put themselves out of work' Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the deal 'means that when our people are moved by a company to India they will be paying into the UK system and not the Indian system' Indian nationals accounted for the highest proportion of UK work visas issued last year.

She lived in Solihull.As my sister had no family in the UK I had to arrange her care, register her death and make funeral arrangements from the other side of the world.

What are they attracted to? A siren's mix of tax-free wages, five-star medicine, almost no crime, and unlimited business prospects. No surprise that some 20,000 Brits have already set off for this Arabian peninsula haven!The Popularity of QatarSocial media is really abuzz with Qatar content today. Young Brits are inundating TikTok with viral clips of the just-about-impossible security – individuals leaving keys scattered across the bonnets of high-end cars for hours, then returning to find nothing disturbed. Have a go at that in London and see what happens!In the past, the United Arab Emirates have been the most popular nation with its two biggest cities, Dubai and Abu Dhabi, but now young people are being enticed to move to Qatar, especially Britons.Doha gained popularity as it hosted 2022 FIFA World Cup, where the world was exposed to the Qatari culture and innovative architecture. Even adding their national team to the popular game FC (previously FIFA franchise), where foreigners started meeting the biggest players from the Qatar team.A Cheaper LifestyleHere's the kicker – despite being one of the planet's richest countries thanks to its oil and gas bonanza, Qatar is surprisingly affordable compared to the UK. According to the Daily Mail, living costs in Britain are a whopping 34.2% higher than in Qatar. Restaurant prices? Nearly 50% more expensive back home. Groceries? 41.5% pricier in Britain.Even a McDonald's meal will leave your wallet significantly lighter in London than in Doha. Combine cheaper everyday costs with juicy business opportunities (especially in real estate), fewer crowds, and that sweet, sweet tax-free income, and you can see why Qatar is stealing the crown from its neighbors.Sports as Image LaunderingPrior to the World Cup, due to the country's poor football infrastructure, new stadiums and hotels had to be built in order to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup. During the construction process, more than 400 people lost their lives, as working conditions were extremely poor. Fatal accidents included falls from dozens of metres and heat strokes largely due to the lack of rest, hydration, and food suffered by the workers.The entire World Cup process was criticised globally, with hundreds of reports exposing the cruelty in which Qatar had been involved and arguing that the country did not deserve to host a World Cup. However, when it came down to it, these reports and criticisms did not have a tangible impact.Despite multiple boycott attempts against the sporting event, more than 1.4 million tourists travelled to Qatar for the World Cup, many without tickets. In total, 3.4 million people attended the matches. When multiplying the average ticket price of £187 ($250), it results in a total of £636 million ($850m) in just under a month.And this figure only accounts for match attendance, not including accommodation, flights, tourism, souvenirs, and stadium purchases. Therefore, the total amount of money generated in just one month exceeded one billion dollars — a ridiculous sum, which would not have been reached if people truly cared about the human rights violations that occurred during the 2022 World Cup preparations.Inspired by Abu Dhabi's success with its investment in Manchester City and the exposure gained by its most prominent tourism brand, Etihad, Qatar decided to follow suit in 2011 by purchasing the French club Paris Saint-Germain through its government investment fund, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), with Nasser Al-Khelaifi as the main figure behind the project.Al-Khelaifi being one of the best friends of the Qatar emir was appointed by him in the project. This strategy resulted in a dramatic rise in the popularity of Qatar Airways as a brand, and it has also boosted Qatar's visibility as an institution and a popular tourist destination for football fans.Despite ongoing criticism from human rights groups, the Qatari government's aggressive promotion through sports and their flagship airline continues to pay dividends. Many seem willing to overlook troubling human rights issues in exchange for the lifestyle perks Qatar offers.For a growing number of young Britons weighing their options in a cost-of-living crisis, Qatar represents an irresistible opportunity – controversy be damned.

The financial guru, Martin Lewis and his team at MoneySavingExpert.com, highlighted the concerning trend that up to 900,000 patients are reportedly overlooking significant savings as per recent analysis.The NHS prescription prepayment certificate (PPC) system is crafted to support England\\'s patients in reducing their medication expenses. An NHS PPC operates much like a prepaid card, presenting it to your pharmacist allows you to collect necessary medications without the per-item charge.With each prescription in England carrying a fee of £9.90, individuals often find themselves footing the bill for multiple items concurrently. Urging awareness, MoneySavingExpert.com founder Martin Lewis expressed: \"We need to spread the word to anyone in England who regularly gets prescriptions – including some with chronic illnesses – to check out prepayment certificates.\"He strongly advises acting promptly to secure these savings: \"And do it sooner rather than later. Doing it now would mean you pay less for longer. My simple rule of thumb is if you get more than one prescription a month on average, a prepayment certificate is the cheapest option as it caps what you pay. They give you unlimited prescriptions for either three months or a year. For someone using an average of two prescriptions a month, it\\'d be a £120 saving and it\\'d reduce the worry if you needed more, as you wouldn\\'t have to shell out more.\"According to the NHS, approximately 872,000 patients could have potentially saved around £35 million (£41 each on average) in 2023/24 by purchasing a 12-month Prepayment Certificate (PPC). There are two prepayment options available and once purchased, it covers all your prescriptions for that period, reports the Liverpool Echo.For the first time since 2022, prices will remain unchanged for 2025 and are listed below.Three-month prepayment certificate - £32.0512-month prepayment certificate - £114.50 There\\'s also a specific PPC for hormone replacement therapy: 12-month HRT prepayment certificate - £19.80Someone who gets two prescriptions each month for 12 months would save more than £100, compared with paying for individual prescriptions.

That deal, reportedly worth close to $1 million per season, has yet again become a major point of contention as speculation around his long-term future resurfaces.Oliver the missing piece for the Cats? | 01:43A potential move to Geelong last year was heavily publicised, as was an alleged mega offer from Adelaide back in 2023. It left Oliver to be told by Melbourne he was ‘on the trade table’ at the back end of 2024, after not performing to his usually-lofty standards by his own admission.With the three-time All-Australian having temporarily stepped away from senior selection, conversations around his long-term standing at the Demons are again gathering momentum.Oliver’s worth in 2030 could reportedly be worth as much as $1.7 million in the last year of his contract. It is a sum that looms as a significant hurdle for any club to jump over, let alone Geelong, whose list management strategy has rarely revolved around large salaries. The Cats have rarely splashed big money on individual players — Patrick Dangerfield’s arrival in 2016 and Jeremy Cameron’s at the end of 2020 the two notable exceptions.That salary — and Geelong’s typical caution with big-money deals — is the central roadblock.For the Cats to land the inside bull, they would need to make even further cuts to the wages of several players already on contracts below their market value. Alternatively, they would have to rely on the Demons continuing to subsidise a portion of Oliver’s wage post-departure — an arrangement that, while uncommon, has precedent in modern footy.Clayton Oliver of the Demons. Picture: Jonathan DiMaggio/AFL Photos/via Getty ImagesSource: Getty ImagesSo, while the latter solution might sound easy enough for the Cats to strike a deal with, it will be incredibly difficult (to say the least) for Melbourne to come to terms with and accept.If a trade were to happen, it would almost certainly have to involve a multi-club deal or future picks; particularly if the Demons were set in stone on not carrying too much of his salary burden. For Geelong, the prospect of pairing Oliver with Max Holmes and new star recruit Bailey Smith, you would think, is still very enticing.As the ladder stands heading into Round 9, the Cats hold Picks 12, 30, 48 and 66. It would be wishful thinking to say that draft hand alone is enough for a trade to go through — and that’s before taking into account the value of his playing contract.So ahead of Round 9, there appears to be no genuine rival suitor for Oliver.“I think he’s playing at Melbourne (in 2026),” ex-teammate and four-time premiership player Jordan Lewis told Fox Footy’s On The Couch on Monday night.“I would think, for another club to take him, a half-a-million-dollar pay-cut — at least, per year.“To say it in simple terms like that, I think it’s inevitable that he stays at Melbourne, and I don’t know what they need to work through to make sure that he’s happy and healthy in that environment, but I just think it would be too difficult to go somewhere else.”Would Oliver take a big pay cut to walk? | 02:05Melbourne have remained publicly supportive of Oliver’s growth after concerns with his off-field behaviour, but the writing may already be on the wall. The club was open to offers last year, and may well be again — despite the public narrative that they expect him to be a Demon for life.“I expect him to be (at the club next year),” teammate Jack Viney declared on Tuesday. “He’s a terrific teammate, I don’t expect not to be otherwise.”Despite that support, there’s also a risk in not trading Oliver and retaining him.After a strong pre-season, Oliver’s output this season on the surface looks sound, averaging 27.6 disposals, 14.4 contested possessions, 7.0 clearances, 5.3 tackles and 4.9 score involvements.But according to Champion Data’s Player ratings system, he’s the 211th-ranked player in the competition — a light improvement on last year (244th) but still a far cry from his brilliant stint between 2018 and 2022 where he was among the top 30 players in four of out five seasons — and in the top 10 twice. He’s polled just one vote in AFL Coaches’ Association Champion Player of the Year so far this year — an award he won back-to-back in 2021 and 2022.Considering he’s still only 27, there’s still every chance Oliver can find that blistering form that made him one of the most dynamic inside midfielders in the competition. But would he be more likely to reach those heights at another club in a fresh environment, rather than at Melbourne considering the array of recent issues?Clayton Oliver of the Demons. Picture: Robert Cianflone/Getty ImagesSource: Getty ImagesKeeping Oliver, too, would swallow up a decent portion of the Demons’ salary cap. They already have Christian Petracca (2029) and Jacob Van Rooyen (2029) on long-term deals, veterans Jack Viney (2028) and Max Gawn (2027) both still have several years left and first-round draftees Caleb Windsor (2028) and Koltyn Tholstrup (2028) have already extended their deals. And then there’s fellow first-round picks Harvey Langford and Xavier Lindsay (both 2027), who automatically signed three-year contracts last year.The Demons would love to pick in-form star Kysaiah Pickett, who’s contracted to the club until at least the end of 2027 but has been heavily linked to an interstate move at season’s end. Whether the Demons would be prepared to keep paying a portion of Pickett’s salary in exchange for more top-end picks — or get the cash off their books and take a later draft compensation — remains unclear.Either way, retaining Oliver could require a bit of a Dees cap juggling act.Speaking on Fox Footy’s AFL 360 on Tuesday night, Melbourne great Garry Lyon suggested how the Demons can best approach what is quickly becoming a truly unique ‘trade’ timeline.“I respect the call they made last week (to not play Oliver). It seemed to speak to a bit of maturity between both club, and player, that they’ve come together more meaningly than they have in the past,” he said.Lyon added: “My position’s always been keep your superstars … but I do acknowledge that this is now at a really delicate stage.Oliver playing against Geelong in Round 17, 2022 at GMHBA Stadium (Photo by Dylan Burns via Getty Images)Source: Getty Images“What they need to do is to continue in this vein of being open, honest and transparent — totally. Cards on table. No ‘I’ll go make a few calls on your behalf’, and no whipping down to Geelong behind your back.“I think there’s a really interesting month (or two) ahead.”While there is no suggestion that a move is imminent, the relationship between Oliver and the club remains under close watch. The idea of a parting post-2025 is, again, no longer far-fetched.The risk factor for any suitor, Geelong or otherwise, is significant. Not just in salary, but in stability. Would Oliver thrive in a new environment, or would a move only deepen the challenges he’s currently working through?The Cats have a long-standing history under Chris Scott of being able to bring out the best of all types of characters and personalities. Right now, the club — and by extension, the competition — are embracing Bailey Smith as much as any player in recent memory.An Oliver storyline may feel familiar, but the speculation has been reignited. And if he is to walk, it won’t be simple.

With his death, a burgeoning artistic career was cut short. Majerus had been the subject of a solo museum exhibition in Switzerland, in 1996, and he’d created a major installation for the Venice Biennale, in 1999. There would be no more of his innovative œuvre, which included individual painted canvases in addition to room-scale installations smashing together the vocabulary of early digital culture—lo-fi video games, internet-y typefaces—with aggressive brushstrokes and flat planes of color borrowed from Abstract Expressionism and Minimalism. Majerus’s souped-up Apple PowerBook G3 laptop, however, survived the wreck—at least, the hard drive did.The computer remained with his estate for many years, a relic left untouched. During that time, Majerus’s paintings continued to be shown in galleries and museums, exerting a quiet but persistent influence on a generation of artists who were creating work using and responding to the internet. Then, in 2017, the artist Cory Arcangel, famous for his digital art works, became aware of Majerus’s hard drive and began a quest to access its contents. What prompted Arcangel’s interest was an untitled painting of Majerus’s, from 2000, that an assistant had shown him on Instagram. The background is covered in acid-pastel blocks of color, reminiscent of the Neo-Geo movement of the nineteen-eighties, but the foreground contains evocative phrases in text that looks pulled from Geocities or a “Matrix”-era rave poster: “Newcomer,” “burned out,” “fuck the intention of the artist.” Majerus had intuited that the internet would lead to a great collision of styles and reference points—everything from Super Mario to Jackson Pollock coexisting in pixels. The untitled painting inspired nostalgia for the dial-up millennial generation, but Arcangel, whose own work includes a hacked version of “Super Mario Bros.” with only its clouds remaining, was also struck by how contemporary it seemed. During a recent Google Meet call from an austere apartment that a gallery representing the Majerus Estate maintains in Berlin, Arcangel said, “It just came at me from a hundred different angles, and each one of these little things sent me off into a spiral of associations.”Given Majerus’s incorporation of digital imagery, such as video-game sprites, and the fluency of his tech-culture references, Arcangel guessed that Majerus was as much a digital artist as an analog painter. Perhaps the laptop held the key to his process. Arcangel brought the hard drive to the attention of Dragan Espenschied, the preservation director at Rhizome, a New York institution that archives the history of art created in digital environments. There was a risk that the hardware might malfunction and the stored files would be lost forever. The Majerus Estate commissioned a data rescue company to create a digital copy of the drive. Then, Espenschied used an emulator—a piece of software that mimics the entire architecture of an older device—to boot up a facsimile of the laptop, including its early-two-thousands operating system and the pixellated file icons on Majerus’s cluttered desktop, which featured a background image from Ms. Pac-Man. This was his computer exactly as he had left it, down to his customized Photoshop shortcuts and the positions of the windows. “It’s like he just stepped out of the room,” Arcangel said.The contents of the computer revealed Majerus to be an artist who was “aggressively digital-native,” Arcangel said. From the files, Arcangel could reconstruct how Majerus had downloaded and collaged images of geometrically shaped Frank Stella paintings from the nineteen-sixties, zooming in, slicing them apart, and rotating them, then using them as the basis for his own wall-size, triangular “pressure groups” paintings, from 2002. Majerus used Photoshop to design his paintings and then virtually install them in specific gallery spaces in advance, tailoring the layout down to the inch, before his brush ever touched canvas. Arcangel has described Majerus as a kind of robotic “printer,” making all his decisions in advance and then rendering the output by hand.The laptop also contained poignant artifacts of Majerus’s life: a photo of what appears to be a tiny New York City hotel room, with the artist’s chunky black laptop on the hotel bed alongside a bulky power adapter, a pizza box, candy, and a binder of compact disks, a television blaring in the background. What emerges is a portrait of the artist as an itinerant hacker, and a snapshot of digital creation in the years before social media or the advent of the cloud. “There’s only a few years where somebody would have carried around their whole studio with them,” Arcangel said.Arcangel, who is forty-six, has a background in music composition but transitioned into visual art in the two-thousands, using a laptop similar to Majerus’s to create his early work. As Arcangel explored Majerus’s computer, he found himself remembering reflexively how to navigate the vintage software. The digital tools are part of the legacy of Majerus’s work—his art makes viewers recall what it was like to use the Photoshop paint bucket or burn a CD, back when those were radical technological experiences. Arcangel began recording a series of YouTube videos titled “Let’s Play Majerus G3,” riffing on the genre of Twitch-stream videos that capture creators playing video games. Last weekend in Berlin, Arcangel performed an iteration of “Let’s Play Majerus G3” at the Majerus Estate for an audience of a hundred gallerygoers, talking through the artist’s desktop and pulling up his favorite files. They included one of the only existing videos of Majerus painting, and a Photoshop image in which the artist had made a digital sketch, then edited that sketch into a photograph of his studio, visualizing what it would be like if the digital image were a canvas leaning against the wall, as if it were a physical work-in-progress. In this way, Arcangel explained, Majerus seemed to merge his computer and his IRL studio into one creative space.Digital art has thus far not proved to be particularly durable. There are now more than two decades’ worth of experimental websites, art projects on defunct social networks, and vernacular digital images that have simply been lost to technological obsolescence and disuse. Majerus’s laptop, and Arcangel’s archival work and performances, represent an effort to insert the visual legacy of our era into the longer arc of art history, to immortalize the ephemeral modus vivendi of a particular technological moment. On our video chat, Arcangel pulled up another collage in which Majerus had placed images of his work next to photos of vintage Stella exhibitions, installations of the Neo-Geo painter Peter Halley’s work, and a more recent Stella painting that Majerus had encountered in a Manhattan skyscraper lobby. He was measuring his own accomplishments against those of his influences, merging art-historical references with his own output across time, on his super-powered laptop. Majerus’s art work was birthed on the screen, and through his recovered files, Arcangel said, “We get to see over the shoulder of one of the best artists to ever do it.” ♦', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Arcangel recovers Majerus's digital art legacy\\nENTITIES: Cory Arcangel, Michel Majerus, Dragan Espenschied, Rhizome\\nEVENT: Cory Arcangel recovered Michel Majerus's hard drive after his death in a plane crash, revealing his digital art process and merging of digital and physical art.\\nCONTEXT: Cory Arcangel recovers Michel Majerus's digital artistic legacy.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 47120, 'sourceId': 890, 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/us/politics/white-house-melania-absence.html', 'title': 'A Most Sensitive Subject in the White House: Where Is Melania?', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T21:12:08.000Z', 'content': 'You have a preview view of this article while we are checking your access.

He reported from Washington. May 7, 2025Updated 5:12 p.m. ETThe lights never seem to be on and the shutters stay shut.As the weeks pass by at the White House, the corner of the residence long used by first ladies remains dark, because this first lady does not really live in Washington. Melania Trump vanishes from view for weeks at a time, holing up in Trump Tower in Manhattan or in Florida, where she can lie low at Mar-a-Lago. Administration officials say she is at the White House more often than the public knows, but when exactly, and for how long, these officials will not (or perhaps cannot) say for certain.It’s like having Greta Garbo as first lady.Mrs. Trump is expected to reappear in the capital on Thursday to unveil a postage stamp honoring Barbara Bush, the former first lady, and to attend a ceremony for military mothers. But two people with knowledge of Mrs. Trump’s schedule said she had spent fewer than 14 days at the White House since her husband was inaugurated 108 days ago. Others say even that is a generous estimate. Officials in the East Wing and West Wing declined multiple requests for comment for this article.That the first lady’s whereabouts is among the most sensitive of subjects in this White House only adds to the intrigue. “We haven’t seen such a low-profile first lady since Bess Truman, and that’s going way back in living human memory, nearly 80 years ago,” said Katherine Jellison, a historian at Ohio University whose research has focused on first ladies. She said that, like Mrs. Trump, Mrs. Truman spent much of her time running back to “her home base whenever she had the chance.” (In Mrs. Truman’s case, that was Independence, Mo.) “She just kind of liked her own private world,” Ms. Jellison said.The same is true of this first lady. She has hired staff to work for her in the East Wing, but she rarely goes into the office. Even regulars at Mar-a-Lago say they don’t often see Mrs. Trump around the premises.

The suit, which identifies the women only as Jane Does 1 through 4, says Mr. Robinson raped them repeatedly while his wife, Frances, who is a co-defendant, turned a blind eye.In a statement provided to The New York Times, Mr. Robinson’s lawyer, Christopher Frost, called the suit “an ugly method of trying to extract money from an 85-year-old American icon.”“We ask anyone following this case to reserve judgment as the evidence comes to light and all the actual facts of the case unfold,” Mr. Frost said.The lawsuit, which was filed on Tuesday in Superior Court in Los Angeles, says that three of the women feared reporting Mr. Robinson to the authorities because of their immigration status. “As low-wage workers in vulnerable positions, they lacked the resources and options necessary to protect themselves from sexual assaults throughout their tenure as employees for the Robinsons,” their lawyer, John Harris, said on Tuesday.The lawsuit goes into graphic detail about the abuse claims.Mr. Robinson, it alleges, would drop off his wife at a nail salon and rush home to assault one of the women while she was alone in the Robinsons’ house in Chatsworth, a Los Angeles neighborhood.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Under-fire footy star Willie Rioli won't play in Port Adelaide's Showdown against the Crows after the forward was investigated for threats to multiple rival players Port president David Koch this week said the club was 'incredibly angry' about the Rioli saga Many footy fans were in disbelief that Rioli wasn't sanctioned by the AFL (he is pictured left, with Port Adelaide coach Ken Hinkley) 'We've talked pretty sternly to Willie about it and said it's just not on,' Koch told 5AA Radio.'I'm making absolutely no excuse for Willie's private message after the game.'But you can't mix on-field and off-field comments or it will lead to places people don't want to go.'It comes as former AFL star Nick Riewoldt slammed the league for inconsistencies in the way it penalises players and has questioned the claim they were unaware of other threats made by Rioli.Riewoldt described the situation as 'another embarrassment' for footy boss Laura Kane.The league's failure to fine or suspend Rioli has infuriated fans, who blasted the sport's bosses for being weak and treating the Port Adelaide star with kid gloves.Respected footy commentator Gerard Whateley also felt the AFL's lack of action was deplorable.'I can't quite fathom where the AFL has landed here....(for me) they are in breach of community standards,' Whateley said on Fox Footy. Willie Rioli allegedly threatened Bailey Dale following Port's loss in round eight - and since then two other incidents have come to light Rioli threatened Bailey Dale (pictured, with his fiancée Erin Meade) after the pair clashed on the field during the Bulldogs' big win over Port Adelaide 'The football public is unhappy to say the least....they (AFL) have pulled up to punish Osama bin Laden masks at an off-season party and flipping the bird, which presumably is done for the likelihood to incite.'They seem to have just completely missed the gravity of a player (Rioli) sending a message to a rival player's teammate threatening (him) the day after a game, which I think, to the common man is going well, that's not only in breach of footy standards, that's borderline in breach of the law.'Bulldogs coach Luke Beveridge earlier this week said he wasn't surprised by the AFL's decision not to sanction Rioli. 'Obviously, Willie has made a mistake, he'll learn from it – and we are all OK with that,' he said.'Let's just make sure it doesn't happen again.'\", 'location': 'AUS', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Rioli investigated for threats, misses Showdown\\nENTITIES: Willie Rioli, Port Adelaide, AFL, Bailey Dale, Western Bulldogs, David Koch, Nick Riewoldt, Laura Kane, Gerard Whateley\\nEVENT: Willie Rioli is sitting out a game after being investigated for allegedly threatening rival AFL players, leading to internal club discussions and external criticism of the AFL's handling of the situation.\\nCONTEXT: Rioli's actions and the AFL's response have sparked widespread criticism and debate about player conduct and league consistency.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 51699, 'sourceId': 12355, 'url': 'https://redstate.com/beccalower/2025/05/07/hhs-sec-rfk-jr-and-nih-director-jay-bhattacharya-autism-n2188810', 'title': 'HHS Sec.

Trump Announces New Nominee for Surgeon General PostOkay, now, here was how the mainstream folks twisted things. The AP\\'s lede read:WASHINGTON (AP) — Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan Wednesday to use medical data and records from people on Medicaid and Medicare to help study autism although experts say it’s unlikely to help reveal the condition’s root causes.The story goes on to act as a wet blanket, quoting the leader of the anti-RFK Jr. group, Coalition of Autism Scientists, Helen Tager-Flusberg, who is a professor emerita at Boston University:“Enough research has been done at this point to know there is no simple magic bullet,” she said, cautioning that this type of dataset won’t help with the type of research most needed — into genetics and other prenatal, preconception and early infancy factors.The Associated Press also made sure readers were aware of \"autism researchers and [advocates\\']\" alarm over RFK Jr.\\'s prior comments about more research being needed on some vaccines.Although later, the article admits the positive fact that HHS included in its announcement that the agency is only beginning to build out a platform to \"study chronic conditions and treatments.\" The work on autism is the cold open, in other words.\\nScience is supposed to be about being open to scientists willing to try surprising and different avenues to find answers. There\\'s no harm in asking questions in science. That\\'s kind of Kennedy\\'s point about conventional medicine, and people\\'s distrust of Big Pharma, when academia and the old guard push back with such ferocity--while Americans are screaming at them that what they\\'re doing isn\\'t working.\\xa0The results of the partnership, in fact, could be fascinating, with an impressive number of cases at their fingertips to investigate.

But when they awoke later in the morning, the two children were gone.The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) proceeded under the belief the children, members of the Mi’kmaq First Nation community of Sipekne’katik, wandered off from their home and probably entered a heavily forested area.Speaking to the media on Tuesday, Staff Sgt Curtis MacKinnon said that dozens of searchers were being ordered to stand down and confirmed that the RCMP’s major crime unit had been involved in the investigation since 3 May.MacKinnon said all missing persons files “are treated as suspicious until our investigation leads us to determine otherwise”.He said teams were left with fewer areas to search after after combing through kilometres of unforgiving terrain. “We’re not packing up and we’re not giving up.”The disappearance of the children has shaken both the province and the country. And despite a boot print that pushed search teams in one direction, police said there is very little evidence suggesting the children are in the forest.“I want to assure you that our missing persons investigation continues,” MacKinnon said.“Many of us have children of our own and want nothing more than to reunite Lily and Jack with their loved ones.”Sgt Robert McCamon said that hopes have dimmed, given the poor weather and length of time the children have been missing.“The likelihood they’re alive right now is very low,” he said.The Globe and Mail reported that Martell was interviewed by police for four hours, as they requested he walk them through both the day of the children’s disappearance and the days leading up to the incident.He also told police the children had not been in school in the days prior to their disappearance.“My story has been consistent. When you tell the truth it’s always consistent,” he told the Globe.He told CTV Atlantic that he had been conducting his own search since the children went missing.“Hardly any evidence at all since the first day.

He struck out seven and walked two. (Eric Sondheimer / Los Angeles Times) Committed to Long Beach State, Howe was repeatedly getting called third strikes with a slider that Birmingham hitters could never figure out whether to take or swing.The only run of the game came in the bottom of the fifth inning on a sacrifice fly from Jackson Sellz that allowed Shane Bogacz to make a headfirst slide at the plate to beat the throw.Once again, Birmingham failed to win a league title in the 19th season for coach Matt Mowry but is in perfect position to win a sixth City title under Mowry. Allen Olmos struck out four in six innings and will team with freshman Carlos Acuna to give the Patriots the needed one-two pitching duo to try to make it to Dodger Stadium on May 24.El Camino Real, a nine-time City champion, will be the likely No. 1 seed when pairings are announced Saturday, and Howe is reminiscent of the great ECR pitchers from the past who led the team to championships, such as Randy Wolf, Kirk Birkins, Jose Cardona and Matt Malconian.

The team has been winning close games with clutch contributions, whether on hits, bunts or fielding plays.There will be an eight-team Open Division, and the challenge for El Camino Real and Birmingham might be having to face fellow West Valley League teams in the opening rounds. The likely teams headed to the Open Division include Venice, Sun Valley Poly, Sylmar, Banning and Cleveland, with Chatsworth, Carson and Bell in the running.Whatever happens, it would not be a surprise to see El Camino Real and Birmingham meet again for the championship at Dodger Stadium.In other action on Tuesday, Sherman Oaks Notre Dame claimed third place in the Mission League with a 5-1 win over St. Francis.

A good-quality arm not only frees up usable space on your desk’s surface, it enables more ways to move and position your display/s for optimal comfort and ergonomics. And a monitor arm makes your office setup look really cool.\\nThe only catch is the price. Most monitor arms worth buying will cost close to $200, and heavy-duty arms capable of holding two large displays can be priced even higher. The good news is that a good-quality monitor arm is likely to last you for a very long time. That’s why it’s important to make the right choice when you purchase a monitor arm.\\nTo help you with that, we’ve tested several popular monitor arms, for both single- and dual-monitor setups. Below you’ll find our curated list of recommendations, with detailed explanations of what features and qualities make them stand out. We even have some good budget recommendations. Below our picks, we point out some arms that we aren’t so keen on — to provide a point of comparison.\\nErgotron LX Pro – Best monitor arm\\nBest Prices Today:\\n£159.12\\nThe Ergotron LX Pro is a practical, effective, easy-to-use monitor arm. Ergotron achieves this ease-of-install with clever, yet simple, engineering.\\nThe LX Pro’s clamp mechanism, which secures the monitor to a desk, takes the extra step of providing a comfortable handhold that makes it easy to work the clamp without tools. The arm’s two sections, meanwhile, simply slip into place. Ergotron also provides thumb screws for attaching the arm’s VESA mount to the back of your monitor.\\nDepending on your monitor, you may need to use the included hex wrench to tighten the components. Otherwise, installation doesn’t require tools.\\nThe arm’s desk clamp mechanism is wide, which is important. Clamps with a small surface concentrate more force on your desk and cause damage if over-tightened. A wider clamp better distributes the force. That means the LX Pro is less likely to damage weaker desks (though caution when tightening the clamp is recommended).\\nFortunately, the arm’s ease of installation doesn’t lead to functional downsides. The arm can support monitors up to 34 inches diagonally that weigh up to 22 pounds. The arm also lifts up to 13 inches, tilts up to 85 degrees, and can swivel and rotate to a full 360 degrees. Cables are routed through channels in the arm and secured by sturdy detachable cladding. Ergotron provides a 10-year warranty.\\nThe LX Pro even fixes our gripes about its predecessor, the Ergotron LX. The LX Pro’s base is more compact, the white colorway now has a color-coordinated VESA mount, and the new design is more attractive. The only downgrade compared to the old Ergotron LX is a lower maximum weight (the LX could handle up to 25 pounds). But that’s unlikely to matter, as 32-inch and 34-inch monitors usually weigh 15 pounds or less.\\nThe LX Pro’s $209 MSRP is enough to make shoppers think twice, but it’s great value for money. The arm’s overall build quality feels competitive with more expensive monitor arms, such as the Humanscale M2.1.\\nThat makes the Ergotron LX Pro an easy recommendation. It’s simple to set up, looks nice, works well in day-to-day use, yet remains affordable. We already liked the Ergotron LX, but the LX Pro is a great upgrade.\\nWorkstream by Monoprice – Best budget monitor arm\\nBest Prices Today:\\n£98.28\\nThe Workstream by Monoprice single monitor arm is a no-frills solution that delivers basic monitor arm features at an exceptionally low price.\\nThe monitor arm has an all-metal construction that in some ways feels sturdier than the Ergotron LX, as the Workstream doesn’t include as much plastic cladding. It’s not entirely a win, though, as the plastic that exists feels frail (and I even broke a small, though unnoticeable, bit while adjusting the monitor).\\nIt provides a good range of adjustment, with 13.2 inches of height and 90 degrees of tilt, swivel, and rotation. The arm’s height and tilt adjustment are comparable to others on this list, but it can’t swivel in a full circle, which may prove annoying if you frequently move a monitor arm to share your screen with colleagues.\\nThe Workstream’s slim budget is felt in its difficult setup and stiff operation. Users will need to install several screws for a clamp or gromet mount. More screws may need to be adjusted once the arm is in place, as its default tension proved inadequate for supporting a 32-inch monitor.\\nMonoprice lists the monitor as capable of supporting 20 pounds, but I felt the 32-inch monitor (which weighed 15 pounds) was pushing the Workstream to its limits. Monoprice also skimps on the warranty, offering just one year of coverage.\\nThese flaws are easily excused by the Workstream’s $60 price tag. It’s clearly less capable, less attractive, and more difficult to use than Ergotron’s LX, but it offers a good range of adjustment and durable construction for less than half the price. It’s an ideal choice for shoppers on a tight budget, as well as those who plan to install a small, light 24-inch or 27-inch monitor.\\nHuanuo HNSS6 Single Monitor Arm – Best monitor arm under $50\\nBest Prices Today:\\n£29.99\\nThe Huanuo HNSS6 Single Monitor Arm is easily our go-to recommendation for shoppers looking to buy the least expensive monitor arm that can still fulfill its job.\\nThe arm comes in two pieces: The lower portion swivels while the upper portion allows for height, tilt, and rotation adjustments. A gas spring provides tension to keep monitors aloft, which is an upgrade from the clips and screws used by the least expensive arms. However, it’s worth noting that gas springs can lose their potency over time. These features are typical for the price: Most competitors are similar in design and use a gas cylinder.\\nWhat makes the Huanuo a winner is its overall quality and ease of install. Setup required installation of just three screws (and adjustment to a couple more). The clamp used to mount the arm to the desk was intuitive compared to rivals like the MountUp Single Monitor Arm, as the spacing of the clamp is adjustable without removing and re-installing screws to secure it. The arm claims to hold 32-inch displays up to 20 pounds, which is enough to hold most monitors. We tested it with panels up to 32 inches weighing up to 12 pounds, and it supported those with ease.\\nOne notable downside is cable management. The plastic covers provided are finicky and won’t hold many wires, so if you want to add USB cables in addition to a video connection and power, you’re probably out of luck. To be fair, though, the same is true of most inexpensive arms.\\nThe Huanuo wasn’t as easy to set up or adjust as the Ergotron LX, our favorite overall pick, and it’s not as sturdy as the Monoprice Single Monitor Arm, which typically sells for $60. Still, the Huanuo gets the job done.\\nHerman Miller Flo – Best upscale monitor arm\\nPrice When Reviewed:\\n£205\\nBest Prices Today:\\nHerman Miller\\n£205\\nWant a monitor arm that gets the job done and looks good doing it? The Herman Miller Flo is for you.\\nThe Flo’s design sets it apart from the pack. Herman Miller ditches the angular, industrial design of many competitors for a smooth, natural look. While clearly designed for a corporate office, it also fits in with a home office setup, where its friendly, approachable look helps it blend in with its surroundings. The Flo is backed by a 12-year warranty and offers 24/7 customer service.\\nIt’s easy to set up and use. The monitor’s clamp works similarly to other monitor arms I tested, but it’s more refined and requires fewer screws (a grommet is also available). The VESA mount is also excellent, providing a simple clip design that’s secure and can be easily pre-mounted to a monitor for simple installation. The way this mount works accommodates monitors that have a slightly recessed mount position, which may cause problems for other monitor arms.\\nThe monitor’s range of adjustment isn’t much different from other high-end monitor arms. It offers 13.3 inches of vertical adjustment, 80 degrees of tilt, and 360 degrees of swivel and rotation. That’s essentially identical to the less expensive Ergotron LX. The Flo’s operation is smoother, however: I found I could adjust a monitor’s height with a mere nudge.\\nSurprisingly, the Flo has a listed weight limit of 20 pounds and recommends use with monitors weighing at least 7 pounds. Most monitors fit within this range, but some heavier models won’t be compatible with the Flo.\\nHerman Miller lists the Flo at $295, which is a lot to ask for a single-monitor arm. The Ergotron LX offers similar features at a much lower price. However, the Flo is a smoother, more appealing monitor arm, and worth the upgrade if you want form with your function.\\nErgotron HX – Best heavy-duty monitor arm\\nBest Prices Today:\\n£259\\n£273\\nCDW\\n$349\\nIt’s natural, given the only slight difference in name, to think the Ergotron HX is merely an uprated version of the Ergotron LX. That’s not the case. This is an entirely different monitor arm which pairs its increased capacity with improved build quality and a more professional look.\\nFirst, let’s talk weight. The Ergotron HX is rated to hold monitors that weigh up to 42 pounds and screen sizes up to 49 inches. That’s an extraordinarily high weight limit—I haven’t reviewed a single monitor in 2023 that exceeds it. I attached both a 32-inch widescreen and 38-inch ultrawide monitor, which weighed roughly 15 and 20 pounds, respectively, and the HX easily handled both.\\nThe use of plastic is minimal and reserved for small portions of cladding that appear used only for cable routing. The arm’s moving parts include larger, sturdier mechanisms, and felt extremely smooth in my use. Ergotron backs the arm with a 10-year warranty.\\nThe monitors range of adjustment is a bit limited compared to the LX. It offers 11.5 inches of height, 75 degrees of tilt, 180 degrees of swivel, and 360 degrees of rotation. However, a somewhat more limited height adjustment is typical in this category due to the size of monitors these stands are expected to carry.\\nThe monitor arm’s impressive design also provides a more robust look. This could be a con for some, however, as the arm can seem a bit…much in a home office setup. It’s an expensive arm, as well. Expect to pay about $350.\\nThe Ergotron HX is an obvious choice if you want to mount an ultrawide, super-ultrawide, or large format widescreen monitor on your desk.\\nHumanscale M2.1 with M/Connect – Best monitor arm w/ built-in dock\\nBest Prices Today:\\nHumanscale\\n$356\\nThe Humanscale M2.1 with M/Connect laptop docking station is an attractive, robust, and modern monitor arm that can expand your laptop’s connectivity without taking up additional space on your desktop.\\nHumanscale’s entry-level M2.1 doesn’t include a laptop dock, but it’s designed to accommodate the M/Connect 3, which nestles snuggly into the base of the arm. Most home office shoppers will likely choose the M/Connect 3 USB Data Hub, which currently retails for $253 (on top of the M2.1’s base price of $356). The hub adds three USB-C ports and two USB-A ports. If you want even more ports, the $600 M/Connect 3 Pro Dock adds two more USB-A ports, two more USB-C, Ethernet, and two DisplayPort ports.\\nThe M/Connect 3’s added connectivity is an excellent way to expand the ports on a laptop. Its central location makes the ports easy to access and keeps them firmly located in a set position on your desk (as opposed to freestanding hubs and adapters, which tend to get shoved around, or off, a desk). It’s also a good alternative to a USB-C monitor. We like USB-C monitors, but packing connectivity into the monitor can make it difficult to access some ports, as most are located on the rear of the display.\\nConnectivity aside, the Humanscale M2.1 is a robust, if conventional, monitor arm. It can handle monitors between 5 and 15 pounds, which is enough to support the vast majority of widescreen monitors under 32 inches in size. It also has a “smart stop” feature, which lets users customize the amount of rotation the arm allows, and easy-to-use quick release joints that are handy when disassembling or moving the arm. The arm isn’t as smooth in operation as the Herman Miller Flo, but it remains easy enough to adjust.\\nBest Prices Today:\\n£304.54\\nCDW\\n$415\\nTwo monitors are always better than one, and the same goes for monitor arms. It’s no surprise, then, that Ergotron’s LX Side-by-Side ranks as our best dual monitor arm. The Ergotron LX Side-by-Side pairs two LX monitor arms together on one mount. The look, feel, and specifications of each arm are close to its standalone sibling.\\nMonitor size is one exception: While the standard LX is rated for monitors up to 34 inches, the Side-by-Side’s arm is only rated for monitors up to 27 inches. The monitor arms aren’t long enough to fit two 32-inch or 34-inch monitors side-by-side. Vertical arrangements are also supported, though only if one of the two monitors is small (less than 23 inches diagonal).\\nLook and feel is otherwise similar to the standard Ergotron LX, and that’s why the dual monitor arm also earns a recommendation. The dual-monitor arm provides the same winning balance of build quality, adjustability, and smooth operation, and it’s backed by the same 10-year warranty. \\xa0Pricing is a bit higher at $330, which is a slight savings compared to buying two LX arms individually.\\nWorkstream by Monoprice Dual Monitor Arm – Best budget dual monitor arm\\nPrice When Reviewed:\\n£116\\nBest Prices Today:\\n£86.38\\nThe same logic that applies to our favorite dual monitor arm also to the budget model, giving Monoprice’s Workstream Dual Monitor Arm a clear path to victory.\\nIn fact, the dual arm’s pricing is even more impressive. The Workstream Dual Monitor is four times less expensive than the Ergotron LX Side-by-Side. I’m a bit shocked by the quality Monoprice can offer at a $100 price point. Ergotron’s alternative is more attractive and easier to use, but is it four times better? That’s a tough call.\\nThe Workstream’s downsides are identical to standard model. Build quality is impressive for the price, but the arm is difficult to set up and not as smooth in operation. I’m also doubtful the arm is capable of handling two 20-pound monitors, as its spec sheets claim. Fortunately, 27-inch monitors (the largest this arm can handle side-by-side) usually weigh less than 10 pounds, so weight capacity shouldn’t be an issue.\\nHuanuo HNDS12 – Best mid-range dual monitor arm\\nPrice When Reviewed:\\n£119.99\\nBest Prices Today:\\nHuanuo\\n£119.99\\nThe Huanuo HNDS12 represents a middle ground for shoppers who want an upgrade in quality but need to respect their budget.\\nEach monitor arm is almost all metal with only a small piece of plastic to provide cable routing. The arm also has gas springs capable of lifting up to 26 pounds of weight, which is enough to handle 32-inch widescreen and 34-inch ultrawide monitors.\\nThere’s one unusual feature: a USB hub. This includes two USB ports that are placed at the front of the arm base. Each of these will need to plug in to your computer, which might be a problem if you have a laptop with just a few ports, but it’s a functional bonus.\\nThe Huanuo HNDS12, like the HNDS6 (below), is a bit fiddly to set up. It has two clamps that need to be adjusted and roughly a dozen screws that need to be installed. The gas springs also require a bit of adjustment to reduce the force provide, at least when used with a 24-inch or 27-inch monitor.\\nStill, the HNDS12 is a good pick at its regular retail price of $140, which often drops as low as $110 when on sale. It looks attractive and offers plenty of force for holding larger monitors.\\nClearspace Uni-2 – Best upscale dual monitor arm\\nBest Prices Today:\\nClearspace Design\\n$649\\nThe Clearspace Uni-2’s design is a bit different from most competitors. It places two individual arms on a single pole. Each arm can adjust for height, swivel, and tilt, and each monitor mounts to an “independent slider” which can move right or left, making it easier to tune the placement of each monitor relative to the other. Compared to the Humanscale M8.1, I found the Uni-2 easier to adjust. However, the Humanscale M8.1’s beefy crossbar is likely to prove more stable if you’re mounting large monitors.\\nI think the Clearspace Uni-2 looks great, and that’s important. Competitors from Humanscale and Herman Miller also look luxurious but have a more corporate or “executive’s office” vibe. The Uni-2’s softer look feels more appropriate for a home office. Clearspace also provides black, silver, and white colorways, and every component of each colorway is molded in the promised color (which isn’t true of most competitors). Clearspace also throws in subtle touches, like soft-touch inserts on the side of each monitor arm. That’s the kind of design a home office user will appreciate.\\nClearspace also looks to separate itself with connectivity. The Uni-2 comes standard Smart Hub that provides a single USB-A and USB-C port. That’s a small edge over competitors, which often sell the dock as an upgrade. Owners can improve the basic hub with the optional SmartDock (pictured), which expands connectivity to include additional USB ports, HDMI, and Ethernet. Unfortunately, I can’t recommend it: The SmartDock is priced at $650 yet lacks support for features I’d expect at that price, like 4K 60Hz video and 2.5Gbps Ethernet.\\nWhile the optional SmartDock is a miss, the arm is a winner. The Clearspace Uni-2 is expensive, but the price can be justified if you’re picky about the look and feel of your home office space. Clearspace also offers a single-monitor and triple-monitor arm: While I didn’t test them, I expect they’d offer similar perks.\\nMonitor arms that we don’t recommend\\nMountUp MU0004 Single Monitor Arm\\nThe MountUp MU0004 Single Monitor Arm seems like an even more affordable alternative to the Huanuo HNSS6. They look similar in photos, and each has a gas spring. However, the MountUp’s lower price — usually $5 to $10 less than the Huanuo — comes with some compromises.\\nThe MountUp arm was more difficult to install. This is due to the clamp, which has a two-piece design that requires screws be removed and re-installed when adjusting the clamp’s size. Adjustment of the clamp was also a bit more difficult, as turning the knob required more force, and the clamp lacks a rubberized pad to prevent it from marking the underside of your desk. \\xa0We also didn’t like the MountUp’s fit and finish. It had a coarse, matte feel that seemed more industrial than the Huanuo, and miles behind the Ergotron LX.\\nIt’s not all bad news. MonutUp says the monitor arm can support 32-inch displays up to 17 pounds. That’s rather heavy for a modern monitor, and it easily handled a 32-inch display weighing 12 pounds. While inferior to the Huanuo, the MonutUp could work if you don’t mind fiddling with a few more screws during installation and can overlooks is lackluster build quality.\\nStill, it’s hard to justifying paying $30 for the MonutUp if you can bug the Huanuo for $40 (or even $50). A monitor arm can last for years, so spending a few extra bucks for a better experience makes sense.\\nVivo STAND-V002 Dual Monitor Stand\\nBest Prices Today:\\n£27.99\\nAt the time we bought it for testing, the Vivo STAND-V002 was ranked as the second best-selling monitor arm on Amazon. That’s a shame, because it’s easily the worst arm we’ve tested so far.\\nTo be fair, it’s also the least expensive. The STAND-V002 is typically sold below $30. That’s less than many top-selling single monitor arms! Vivo achieves that by cutting the arm’s features to the bone.\\nAdjustability is minimal, so much so that Vivo (mostly) advertises the STAND-V002 as a “desk mount” or “stand” instead of an arm. It has a clamp, a pole, and two jointed arms that attach to the pole at a single point. You can adjust the monitors for height, but only together: One can’t be higher than the other. The arms, meanwhile, have joints that allow swivel and adjustment side-to-side, as well as tilt up and down. You can’t adjust these on-the-fly, though, because everything is tensioned by screws that must be loosened with a tool, adjusted, and then re-tightened to keep the monitors in place.Build quality is poor. Vivo claims the arms can hold two monitors up to 22 pounds each, but we noticed a slight deflection downward even when attaching a 27-inch display weighing 10 pounds. Cable management is provided by plastic clips that are barely adequate to the task and tend to fall off when jostled. The clamp is small and lacks a rubber pad, so it could mark softer woods and materials.\\nWe suppose the Vivo could work if you plan to mount a couple 24-inch monitors and don’t care about adjusting them once in place, but it’s otherwise not worth $30. It’s cheap, sure — but in our experience, monitor arms this cheap tend to fall apart after a couple years (or less).\\nHumanscale M8.1\\nBest Prices Today:\\nHumanscale\\n$545\\nHumanscale is synonymous with high-end office furniture: The Freedom chair is something of an icon in executive offices across the globe. But Humanscale’s high-end office hardware is at times an awkward fit for a home office, as the M8.1 demonstrates.\\nThe Humanscale M8.1 looks similar to the M2.1, but it’s upgraded to handle monitors between 6 and 28 pounds (almost double the M2.1 in our list above). That’s enough to handle nearly any monitor available today, including large ultrawides like the Dell Ultrasharp U4025QW. The arm can also handle two monitors of the appropriate combined weight and offers a “crossbar” to support them both on a single arm.\\nThat’s good, and useful, but pricing is an obstacle. The arm starts at $545, but the crossbar (required to use two monitors) ups the price to $686. The M/Connect 3 laptop dock is also available to the M8.1 but, of course, adds even more to the price. That’s a bit hard to accept when the Ergotron HX, which supports monitors up to 42 pounds, starts at $350, or $585 for the dual-monitor crossbar version. Ergotron’s alternative feels as sturdy, supports even larger and heavier displays, and is less expensive.\\nThe Humanscale M8.1 has features you won’t find on the Ergotron, such as an optional laptop dock and customizable arm rotation, and it’s a fine selection if price is no obstacle. In most cases, though, the M8.1’s price will be hard to justify.\\nHuanuo HNDS6\\nPrice When Reviewed:\\n£59.99\\nBest Prices Today:\\nHuanuo\\n£59.99\\nHuanuo’s HNDS6 is a budget dual-monitor arm that’s popular on Amazon (in fact, it’s listed as the best-seller in Computer Monitor Arms). It provides a reasonable level of quality at a low price but fails to unseat the Workspace by Monoprice Dual Monitor Arm on our list.\\nWe’ll begin with the positives, which, to be clear, outweigh the problems. The Huanuo HNDS6 carefully walks the value tightrope to deliver a decent dual-monitor arm at a typical price of $60 (which can dip below $50 on sale). The arm’s metal construction feels rigid and looks durable.\\nEach arm is rated to hold between 4.4 and 14.3 pounds. That’s not a lot: The Workstream by Monoprice arm is rated up to 20 pounds. Still, it’s enough to handle a huge majority of 24- and 27-inch monitors, and the monitor arms provided plenty of lift in our testing.\\nWe’re not a fan of the arm’s installation. It has two clamps instead of one unified clamp, which is strange, because the base of the monitor arm is one solid piece. There are roughly a dozen screws to install. And the included cable routing can prove hard to tighten once several cables are held within the routing.\\nThe Huanuo HNDS6 is a decent dual-monitor arm for the price and worthwhile on a discount (it was once sold for just $38). In general, though, we think the Monoprice Workstream Dual Monitor Arm provides more for a similar price.\\nWhat to look for in a monitor arm\\nPurchasing a monitor arm is a bit different from purchasing most home office gear. A monitor arm, unlike a monitor, is a hefty, durable piece of equipment that never really goes obsolete. It must also support the specific functions you want out of the box, since upgrades and customization tend to be limited.\\nIf you’re still on the fence about whether a monitor arm is worth the money and the time it takes to set up, read our article that answers why a monitor arm is most definitely worth it.\\nAdjustability and range of motion\\nThe range of adjustability and motion a monitor arm can offer is a critical but often overlooked feature. A monitor arm should adjust for height, tilt, swivel, and pivot—and it should do so without tools.\\nAll the monitor arms we recommend meet this standard, but some differences remain. Only some monitor arms provide 360 degrees of swivel, meaning the neck of the monitor arm can be rotated to any position. That’s handy if your desk is in the middle of your room since you can use the monitor from various positions.\\nMost inexpensive monitor arms ditch adjustability and stick with simple tension mechanisms that are secured by a screw. It’s inexpensive but fixes the monitor’s position in place once it’s adjusted. We recommend avoiding mounts that use this strategy.\\nEase of installation and adjustment\\nNone of the monitor arms tested were difficult to install, but the difference between budget and premium models was clear. Budget models require more screws to install, and the default tension of the arm’s adjustment mechanism is less likely to be suitable out-of-the-box.\\nThe ease of adjustment varies greatly, too. All the monitor arms we surveyed require an Allen wrench to adjust tension (which is necessary if the arm seems too stiff or loose), but some were much more difficult than others. The Herman Miller Flo felt smooth and effortless, while the Workstream by Monoprice required serious torque.\\nCable management\\nProper cable management is important if you value a clean, clutter-free desk.\\nThis is one aspect of design that didn’t improve with pricing. The Herman Miller Flo’s cable management was basic, while the Workstream by Monoprice hid cables well. This did come with a trade-off, though, as the Flo’s seemed least likely to cause cables to bind while moving the monitor.\\nWhile cable management is useful, none of the monitor arms I tested can handle the full complement of cables that might be attached to a high-end USB-C monitor (like the Dell U3223QE). This is an aspect of monitor arm design that manufacturers could improve.\\nMaximum supported size and weight\\nIt’s important to buy a monitor arm that can handle the monitor you own.\\nThis won’t be a major concern if you own a 24-inch or 27-inch monitor, as most such monitors weigh 10 pounds or less. With that said, it’s wise to double-check the monitor’s weight before buying a monitor arm. Remember the monitor’s weight can exclude its stand. Larger 32-inch, 34-inch, and 49-inch monitors are more difficult to handle and may require an upgrade to a “heavy duty” monitor arm.\\nMonitor size limits should be respected as well. It might be possible to attach a 40-inch monitor to an arm meant for a 32-inch monitor. The 40-inch monitor may even come within the arm’s weight limit. A larger monitor will distribute weight differently, however, which could cause an arm’s tension mechanism to fail.\\nHow we test monitor arms\\nEvery monitor arm we recommend was personally tested first-hand at a PC World contributor’s home or the PC World office. We examine the quality, ease of installation, and range of adjustment of each arm to verify it meets the manufacturer’s claims. The monitors we use to test arms can vary over time, but generally include at least one 27-inch and one 32-inch widescreen monitor. Monitor arms rated for “heavy duty” use were tested with at least one monitor that weighs 20 pounds or more.\\nFAQ\\n1.Is a monitor arm worth it?\\nWhether a monitor arm is worth the price is subjective, but we believe our recommended monitor arms are worth making the investment. A monitor arm is easier to use than a stand, allows a wider range of adjustment, and keeps your desk clear of clutter. They’re also durable—there’s a good chance you’ll replace a monitor before the monitor arm.\\n2.Are monitor arms compatible with my monitor?\\nNearly all monitors, and nearly all monitor arms, use the VESA mounting standard. The 100x100mm bolt pattern is by far the most common, though 75x75mm is sometimes used as an alternative. All the monitor arms we recommend support both bolt patterns.\\nNot sure that your monitor supports VESA? Check the rear of the monitor. The VESA mount can be found in the center of the monitor, and the bolt pattern can be verified with a ruler or tape measure. This is likely beneath the neck of your monitor’s stand if you have one attached.\\nIt’s possible to mount a monitor that lacks a VESA mount, but you’ll need to purchase a VESA adapter. It’s a large, X-shaped device that clamps to the rear of the monitor.\\n3.Are monitor arms compatible with my desk?\\nMost monitor arms offer two mounting options: clamp and gromet.\\nA clamp mount is the most common for home office use. A U-shaped clamp fits over an edge of your desk. A screw mechanism is used to secure it. Most clamps are adjusted by hand and fit a wide range of desks. It’s important to double-check a monitor arm’s specifications if your desk is more than an inch thick, as some clamp mounts are too small to work with a thick desk surface. The clamp also requires an edge that’s free of obstructions on both the top and bottom of the desk.\\nGrommet mounts insert into the circular cut-outs found on many desks built and sold for corporate offices. A grommet mount is also a form of clamp, but size of the mechanism is different, and the mount attaches the monitor to the interior of the desk instead of an exterior edge.\\nNearly all monitor arms ship with a clamp and grommet mount, but grommet mounts are less common. It’s wise to double-check that a grommet mount is supported if that’s how you plan to mount the monitor arm.\\n4.Will a monitor arm damage my desk?\\nIt’s possible that a monitor arm’s clamp mount, if used, will cause minor damage to your desk. It may scratch the desk’s surface when mounted or removed, and over-torquing the clamp might cause a dent on some softer desks, such as those which use a veneer over particleboard. A glass desk can also prove troublesome—refer to the desk’s manufacturer to make sure it’s safe to use a monitor arm.\\n5.Do monitor arms wobble?\\nA quality monitor arm will tame minimal monitor wobble, though some might come through if the arm is mounted to a thin, light desk. Make sure to mount the monitor arm to a secure surface and adjust the arm’s tension to a level suitable for the monitor you’ve mounted.\\n6.Should I buy a $25 monitor arm on Amazon?\\nA monitor arm’s price tag can intimidate budget shoppers. Most budget monitors sell for $200 or less. Spending another $150 to $300 for a monitor arm can seem hard to justify.\\nStill, we encourage shoppers to avoid cheap monitor arms found on Amazon and other retailers. The least expensive monitor arms lack a dynamic tension mechanism, like a gas piston or spring. A few arms in the $35 to $50 range use a gas piston, but it’s often a wimpy example barely sufficient for holding a 27-inch monitor.\\nInexpensive monitor arms also lean more heavily on plastic. That’s not necessarily a problem out-of-the-box, but plastic tends to become brittle over time, which may reduce the lifespan of a monitor arm.\\nAuthor: Matthew S.

'Imagine a private person wanting to keep their private life private. Shocking'.Another argument reposted by Hudson reads: 'I see a woman who cares about her man and doesn’t want him to be screwed around by the media.''Bill looks like he wants to reach across and strangle the life out of the interviewer. I kinda wish he did,' said a third. She reshared a user on X who argued against Robert Griffin III claiming she is a 'distraction' The ex-cheerleader gatecrashed the interview to shut down a question about how they met One user responded to an article by Pro Football Talk questioning Hudson's involvement in the interview and wrote: 'Or maybe she didn’t want her or their personal relationship to be part of the interview instead on football..'I think if they don’t want to talk about they shouldn’t and if anything — your article demons why.. trying to embellish and take things out of context'.TMZ reported\\xa0that Hudson, who has dated Belichick for around three years, stormed out of the interview at one stage - delaying shooting for around 30 minutes - with CBS reporter Tony Dokoupil said to have been 'spooked' by the whole experience.The interview furthers the narrative that Hudson is playing an increasingly large role in Belichick's professional life.\\xa0According to People, Belichick's three children - whom he welcomed with ex-wife Debby - have 'hesitations' about their dad's romance with a woman almost 50 years his junior.A source is quoted as saying that Amanda, 41, Stephen, 38, and Brian, 37 are rooting for their dad despite also holding concerns.

Cupich of Chicago.Credit...Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York TimesMay 7, 2025The College of Cardinals includes 17 members from the United States. But only 10 of those are cardinal electors, meaning that they are allowed to participate in the conclave and vote for the next pope. The other seven are older than 80, the cutoff to be an elector.Six of the 10 cardinals were elevated to the position by Pope Francis and are largely known as vocal supporters of his priorities, particularly on immigration, the environment and poverty. This will be their first conclave:Cardinal Blase J. Cupich of Chicago, 76. Born in Nebraska, he was a bishop in South Dakota and an archbishop in Spokane, Wash. His appointment to Chicago in 2014 was one of Pope Francis’ early moves to reshape U.S. church leadership, particularly to show support for immigrants. Cardinal Cupich’s archdiocese covers about two million Catholics in Cook and Lake Counties.Cardinal Robert W. McElroy of Washington, 71. The former bishop of San Diego is known for regularly speaking out on behalf of migrants, women and L.G.B.T.Q. people in the church and the United States. He has said that the Trump administration’s plans for a “wider, indiscriminate, massive deportation across the country” would be “incompatible with Catholic doctrine.”Cardinal Joseph W. Tobin of Newark, 73. Before coming to Newark, he led the archdiocese of Indianapolis (where he bench-pressed 225 pounds at the gym). As a young priest, he ministered to people with AIDS in Chicago. He has said that he does not see “a compelling theological reason why the pope couldn’t name a woman cardinal.”Cardinal Wilton D. Gregory, archbishop emeritus of Washington, 77. The first African-American cardinal, he was president of the United States Catholic bishops’ conference in 2002 and pushed to pass the Dallas Charter, which instituted a zero-tolerance policy for sexual abuse of minors. Later the archbishop of Atlanta, he supported L.G.B.T.Q. Catholics and commissioned an action plan after Francis’ encyclical on the environment.Cardinal Kevin J. Farrell, prefect of the Dicastery for the Laity, the Family and Life, 77. The Irish-American was formerly bishop of Dallas. Pope Francis made him the camerlengo, or chamberlain, the Vatican’s acting administrator when a pope dies or resigns. He was responsible for verifying Pope Francis’ death.Cardinal Robert F. Prevost, prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops, 69. A Chicago-born priest, he advised the pope on bishop appointments around the world. He is also a member of the Order of Saint Augustine, a religious order of men and women who follow the teachings of the fourth-century saint. Cardinal Prevost is also seen by some as a contender for pope, though a long shot. (There has never been an American pontiff.)Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Currently, the farms are often asked to curb their output as it cannot be transported to where it is needed.John Flint, NWF chief executive, said on Thursday that upgrading the power grid was “one of the most significant barriers to decarbonising our economy”, adding that “substantial” investment was needed. He did not disclose further details of the terms.\\xa0The UK government aims to decarbonise the nation’s electricity system by 2030, a significant step towards the wider goal of cutting emissions across the economy to net zero by 2050.\\xa0In its report last year that outlined pathways towards the 2030 target, the government’s National Energy System Operator said nearly 1,000km of new cables onshore and 4,500km offshore would be required, costing roughly £60bn by 2030.\\xa0The National Wealth Fund has a mandate to support growth and tackle climate change. It was formerly known as the UK Infrastructure Bank before being rebranded by the government last October.\\xa0In a letter to the NWF in March, UK chancellor Rachel Reeves described it as a “key lever” for the government’s “clean energy mission”.\\xa0She added it should “focus its interventions where there is an undersupply of private finance” and help to “crowd-in private capital”. Investment in electricity grids is in high demand globally, although in many countries they are considered a stable investment as they are regulated monopolies.In the UK, rising network costs are still putting pressure on electricity bills despite the regulator Ofgem’s efforts to control them.

But the poll also showed Labor was in front in the seat, 51.7% to 48.3%.Guardian Australia understands that Climate 200 then showed the poll results to Labor – which had not commissioned any previous polling in Dickson, and was unaware the seat was so close – on 4 April. The party quickly conducted its own survey, which showed Dickson as a dead heat.Peter Dutton at a Salvation Army Red Shield event in Lawnton, Brisbane, in the seat of Dickson. Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAPOn 9 April, Labor’s campaign director, Paul Erickson, sent an email to supporters headed: “We’re taking on Dutton in Dickson”.“I just greenlit an additional $130,000 for Labor’s campaign in Peter Dutton’s seat of Dickson,” Erickson wrote.“Overnight, our campaign conducted new research in Dickson. It turns out Peter Dutton’s seat is closer than we originally thought. I’m sending this email to Labor’s top supporters, because as you read this, we’re working to adjust our budget in response to these findings.”The Coalition told the Courier-Mail at the time that its own polling, conducted by Freshwater Research, had Dutton comfortably in front; Dutton himself dismissed the push as a “propaganda campaign”.“The people of Dickson aren’t stupid,” he said. “The polling I’ve seen puts us in a comfortable position, I’m happy with that. You wouldn’t believe it but Labor put out a fundraising email which started this propaganda campaign. I wouldn’t fall for that.”News Corp reported this week that Coalition insiders withheld polling results from Dutton, including in Dickson. Some Liberal National party insiders dispute that the party would have conducted any significant polling in Dickson. One said: “We tried to win the election, not save the furniture”.Even as results showed big swings away from the Coalition, party faithful were still shocked to see Dutton’s seat go on election night.A ‘huge grassroots campaign’After all, Dutton had been written off in Dickson before. He wasn’t supposed to enter parliament in 2001, but defeated a shadow cabinet minister, Cheryl Kernot, in a seat that had changed hands a few times since it was first contested in 1993. As Dutton said on election night, Dickson had a “one-term curse” before he ran.Heading towards the 2010 election, Dutton held a slim margin and the polls pointed to another big Labor win. He attempted to switch to a safe seat on the Gold Coast, before the electoral tide turned and Dutton increased his margin.And he faced “the fight of his political life” in 2019 when activist group GetUp! poured millions into a ground campaign to oust him. Dutton again defied the push and held on. Labor strategists believe the GetUp! campaign, and the perception it was being funded and run from outside the electorate, probably did more harm than good.“In a state like Queensland, if people perceive that groups from other states have come to tell them what to do or how to live they will react very badly to that,” former Rudd government minster Craig Emerson told Guardian Australia at the time.The newly elected member for Dickson, Ali France of Labor, with Grace Grace, of the Queensland Labor party, at the Labor Day rally in Brisbane on Monday. Photograph: Jono Searle/AAP“That’s not an attack on GetUp, maybe 100% of their volunteers who were on the booths campaigning were Queenslanders, but if there is a perception they were outsiders, Queensland is such a parochial state that it would go down very badly.”This time round Ellie Smith, who won 12.6% of the vote, says her campaign was a grassroots one. Climate 200 gave her $319,590 starting in September, but Smith says most of the money she raised was from locals and local donations.By midway through the campaign, the Coalition appeared spooked by the independent, and began attacking Smith on local billboards.“We started with about 20 friends around a table and it grew very very quickly, the momentum was really there for change in Dickson, people were really motivated and they’d never done anything like it before,” Smith said.“We really set out to win and I think that motivated people [but] we weren’t unhappy with the result.“They saw our campaign as a major threat towards the end of the election. [The Coalition] would have spent 300k in the last three weeks attacking me personally. It really didn’t stick, it was very clear we’d done the work so people understood what I stood for as a community independent.”Dutton’s primary vote of 34.9% – down 7 percentage points – is the lowest in his two decades contesting the seat. When he won narrowly in 2007 – by about 200 votes – the Coalition primary vote was 46%. Part of the story in Dickson is that Smith ate into Dutton’s support, and that her preferences mostly flowed back to Labor.France, who had been widely tipped to beat Dutton in 2019, contested Dickson again in 2022 and brought the margin back to a tight 1.7%.France said on election day that “seven years of work” had helped her forge relationships with people in the area.“I’ve knocked on so many doors, I’ve had so many conversations. I feel like people really know who I am and what I stand for now,” she said.“[Dutton] is a massive spender on his campaign, particularly advertising. We have never been able to compete with that. But what our campaign has always been about is a huge grassroots game. It’s about door-knocking, it’s about the high visibility. It’s about being at markets.”Anthony Albanese visits a campaign office in the seat of Dickson in the suburb of Strathpine. Photograph: Asanka Ratnayake/Getty ImagesLabor sources reject any suggestion that Smith’s campaign radically changed the outcome, pointing to the fact France increased her primary vote, in addition to Smith winning a large chunk of the anti-Dutton vote.The end of a potential PMPaul Williams, an associate professor of politics and journalism at Griffith University, said Dutton’s profile as opposition leader had been “much higher” at this election than ever before. That might have hindered, rather than helped, in Dickson.“There’s no doubt that the overarching factor [for the whole election campaign] was Peter Dutton and his personality and personal style,” Williams said.Like many others, Williams had predicted Dutton would lose Dickson at past elections, only for him to hold on. He said the electorate was part of a bigger story – Queensland seats like Petrie and Forde, both won by Labor unexpectedly, had similar demographics.“These places have a higher proportion of tradies, small businesses, blue collar workers [and they’re] defying electoral gravity.“[People] were hurt by the cost-of-living crisis and yet they’ve rewarded Albo and kicked the opposition in the groin.“One view is that people liked Peter Dutton as a local member, maybe as a minister, but they didn’t want him as a potential prime minister.“[Dutton] is a difficult politician to warm to as a leader. And of course he’s come into focus much more [as opposition leader]. Local voters might not have paid much attention to who their MP was, but after 2022 [Dutton] becomes a figure of national focus and Labor was certainly saying that the more people see of Peter Dutton, the less they like him.”', 'location': 'AUS', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Dutton loses Dickson: Election campaign missteps\\nENTITIES: Peter Dutton, Ali France, Climate 200, Labor, Liberal National Party\\nEVENT: Ali France unseated Peter Dutton in Dickson, marking the first time an opposition leader has lost their seat at a federal election, attributed to a targeted Labor campaign and changing voter sentiment.\\nCONTEXT: Dutton's defeat highlights changing demographics and voter priorities.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 53046, 'sourceId': 12713, 'url': 'https://gizmodo.com/elon-musks-starlink-is-quietly-benefiting-from-tariff-negotiations-2000599325', 'title': 'Elon Musk’s Starlink Is Quietly Benefiting From Tariff Negotiations', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T20:50:54.000Z', 'content': 'Musk seems to be benefitting from the trade war squeeze.\\nThe Trump administration’s tariff regime has squeezed most Americans, causing new financial pressures as the cost of goods goes up, but at least one person seems to be making out pretty well from the situation: Elon Musk. According to a report from the Washington Post, Musk’s satellite internet company Starlink has attracted new interest from nations that are looking to wiggle their way out of Trump’s tariff crunch. The Post highlights the small nation of Lesotho, which was inexplicably subjected to a 50% tax when Trump first announced his so-called “reciprocal” penalties (which turned out to be the result of some sort of very strange, nonsensical formula that may or may not have come from a chatbot). Two weeks after the tariffs were announced, Lesotho leadership met with representatives of Starlink, which had been trying to get a foothold in the country for some time prior, and signed a deal to make the company Lesotho’s first-ever satellite internet service. Coincidences happen, of course. It’s just that, according to the Post, they’re happening pretty regularly right now with Starlink. Around the same time as the tariffs were being discussed and implemented, Starlink also struck deals to provide service in parts of Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of Congo, India, Pakistan, Somalia, and Vietnam.\\nIn the case of Lesotho, a memo obtained by the Post makes it clear that there’s an attempt to curry favor happening: “As the government of Lesotho negotiates a trade deal with the United States, it hopes that licensing Starlink demonstrates goodwill and intent to welcome U.S. businesses,” the internal State Department communication read. It’s hard to imagine that other nations haven’t had similar thoughts of strategically aligning themselves with a company run by a Trump White House employee in order to get some relief. The Trump administration has not been explicitly pushing Starlink on these companies, according to the report, but it has been encouraging countries to do business with US-based satellite internet firms, and there happens to be one very big, prominent one that comes to mind. And it certainly seems like countries are treating Starlink favorably. India, for example, reportedly sped up the approvals process for the company in an effort to grease the wheels for trade deals, per the Post.\\nLining Musk’s pockets may not be the primary purpose of the Trump admin pushing satellite internet on countries (though it surely doesn’t hurt, either). Chinese companies are quickly ramping up to offer an alternative to Starlink, and the US would prefer to capture those markets before its competitors can. So it’s using the leverage to push American products. It is funny how it seems to always benefit Trump’s backers, though, right?

That’s a little larger than the size of Rhode Island.The report, published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, arrives as nations debate whether to pursue industrial mining of the seabed for critical minerals.Some scientists argue that so little is known about the undersea world that more research on the deep seafloor is needed to responsibly move forward with extractive activities.“More information is always beneficial, so we can make more informed and better decisions,” said Katy Croff Bell, a deep ocean explorer who led the study and is the founder of the Ocean Discovery League, a nonprofit group that promotes seafloor exploration.Learning more about the deep sea is essential for understanding how climate change and human activities are affecting oceans, she said.

But for some people, bones – or rather, what’s inside them – are the best part of a meal. Bone broth, once a humble kitchen staple, has surged in popularity in recent years, championed as a superfood by celebrities and wellness influencers.\\nStars such as Salma Hayek and Gwyneth Paltrow are reported to swear by it for beauty and health, while late basketball legend Kobe Bryant used it as a pre-game meal. But bone broth is far from a new discovery – it’s rooted in prehistoric cooking, traditional Chinese medicine and folk remedies around the world.\\nSo, what exactly is bone broth – and does it live up to the hype?\\nGet your news from actual experts, straight to your inbox.

Join The Conversation for free today.\\nThis nutrient-dense liquid, also known as stock, is made by simmering animal bones and connective tissues, such as cartilage and tendons, for 12 to 48 hours. This slow cooking process extracts nutrients such as collagen, amino acids and minerals into the liquid. The result is a rich, savoury broth that can be sipped on its own or used as a base for soups, sauces and stews.\\nWhile store-bought bone broth is convenient, homemade versions offer better control over ingredients and often greater nutritional value. Typical ingredients include bones (from chicken, beef or fish), water, vinegar (to help extract minerals) and various herbs and vegetables for flavour.\\nSkin benefits\\nBone broth is praised for its collagen content – the protein that forms connective tissue in skin, cartilage, tendons and bones. It’s thought to promote joint flexibility and reduce signs of skin ageing.\\nSome studies show that hydrolysed collagen (a broken-down form that’s easier to absorb) may improve skin elasticity and hydration, and reduce wrinkles. Other research suggests it may ease joint pain and stiffness, especially in people with osteoarthritis.\\nHowever, most of these studies focus on collagen supplements and, while it’s often marketed as a collagen-rich superfood, research shows that bone broths don’t contain enough collagen to match the effects seen in clinical studies on supplements. Instead, a balanced diet rich in protein, vitamin C and healthy fats is more reliably linked to collagen production.\\nBig claims, little evidence\\nBone broth is a source of amino acids such as glutamine, glycine and arginine that are thought to support gut lining integrity and immune function. Glutamine, in particular, may help repair the intestinal wall and prevent “leaky gut” – a condition where toxins and bacteria pass through a weakened gut barrier, potentially causing inflammation.\\nSome scientists even suggest links between gut health and conditions such as autism, ADHD, depression and schizophrenia – though this remains a controversial and under-researched area.\\nBone broth is low in calories but high in protein, making it filling and potentially helpful for weight management. It’s also hydrating, providing electrolytes including sodium, potassium and magnesium that are particularly useful during illness or recovery.\\nSome evidence supports the idea that nutrients in bone broth, especially amino acids, can reduce inflammation and support immune function. But overall, there is limited human research on the direct benefits of drinking bone broth. There are, however, potential risks to consider before you add it to your diet.\\nHeavy metal\\nBecause animal bones can accumulate heavy metals such as lead, simmering them for long periods may cause these metals to leach into the broth. While studies on this are mixed, the risk may depend on the source and quality of the bones used.\\nConsuming bone broth with high levels of heavy metals can pose health risks, including minor ailments like headaches, vomiting and tiredness. But more dangerously, heavy metals can also cause organ damage in the long term.\\nResearch on toxic metals in bone broth shows mixed results. Since recipes differ, it’s hard to know the exact nutrition content of each broth. Many shop-bought bone broths contain high levels of sodium, which can raise blood pressure and strain the heart and kidneys. Check labels or make your own to control the salt content.\\nBone broth contains glutamate, a naturally occurring amino acid that may cause anxiety, restlessness or headaches in some people, though evidence for this is largely anecdotal.\\nImproper storage or preparation of bone broth can lead to bacterial contamination, which can cause gut infections and symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhoea. Always refrigerate or freeze broth promptly, then reheat it thoroughly before consumption.\\nBone broth can be a nourishing, tasty addition to your diet, especially when made at home with high-quality ingredients. It’s hydrating, packed with protein and rich in flavour. But it’s not a miracle cure, and the health benefits may be more modest than advertised.\\nIf you’re looking to boost collagen, your best bet is a healthy, balanced diet. Focus on eating plenty of protein, whole grains, fruits and vegetables – all of which provide the nutrients your body needs to naturally produce collagen.\\nIn addition to what’s on your plate, healthy lifestyle habits also play a key role. Prioritise quality sleep (seven to nine hours a night), manage stress, avoid smoking and protect your skin with sunscreen.\\nWhile bone broth may offer some benefits, the scientific evidence supporting its role in collagen production is still limited.

U.S. officials have spent the last few months talking to countries willing to take in people deported from the U.S. NPR\\'s Ximena Bustillo is here in the studio to explain. Hey there.XIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: Hey, Ari.SHAPIRO: So what\\'s the latest on this plan to send migrants to Libya?BUSTILLO: My colleague, Tom Bowman, confirmed the administration is planning to use Libya as a destination for migrants removed from the U.S., though he cautions flights haven\\'t taken off yet, and plans could change. Earlier this week, Rwanda\\'s foreign minister confirmed it was also in talks with Washington about the same issue. And of course, the U.S. has had similar deals already with Mexico and El Salvador. But now the deportations to Libya would be carried out by the U.S. military. It\\'s not clear, though, how many people or what nationalities would be sent under the deal. Tom\\'s source, who was not authorized to speak publicly, says that it would be less than a plane full. President Trump, however, told reporters he didn\\'t know about the plan.SHAPIRO: What concerns have been raised about this?BUSTILLO: I\\'d note Libya\\'s U.N.-backed government issued a statement today that expressed, quote, \"a clear rejection of this approach.\" That\\'s the government that controls Western Libya, while a military strongman controls the east. And all these countries have been floated to take in migrants from - in Africa - have notorious human rights records. Libya itself is a popular route for migrants from other parts of Africa who are trying to make it to Europe. Human rights groups condemn how these migrants have been treated in Libya.SHAPIRO: You mentioned that the U.S. has made other deals to take in migrants and is trying to make still more. Why is this a focus for the administration?BUSTILLO: You know, one of the main goals is to send migrants further away to avoid people crossing back over U.S. borders. That\\'s according to secretary of state, Marco Rubio. But there\\'s also practical considerations. About 1.4 million people in the U.S. have deportation orders, according to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. But there are many challenges to being able to remove these people and get them back to their home countries. One reason is that their home countries may not agree to accept them back, or they have limits on how many people or flights that they can take.So the Trump administration is aiming to make inroads with others to be, quote, \"third-party countries\" that can take in these deportees. These are countries that the people are not originally from, but they\\'re going to go. And these countries are willing to take them after they\\'ve been removed out of the U.S., so they\\'re a third destination for these people.SHAPIRO: Are we likely to see more legal challenges to this plan to send migrants abroad, as we have with some of Trump\\'s other immigration plans?BUSTILLO: Yeah, in fact, we have. Immigration lawyers filed an emergency motion asking a judge in Massachusetts to block removals to Libya or any third country. And they argue their clients, who are Laotian, Vietnamese and Filipino, could be sent in a matter of hours. The judge in the case already issued an injunction limiting the Homeland Security Department\\'s ability to remove migrants to these third countries. In a ruling late Wednesday, they said the order applies to any flights to Libya, too, and it doesn\\'t matter if those flights come from other agencies, including the Department of Defense.SHAPIRO: That is NPR\\'s Ximena Bustillo.

Arsenal need to sign players for the here and now to win the Premier League... so, should they sign Harry Kane?\\nAnother season without a trophy sank towards an agonising anti-climax for Arsenal in the Parc des Princes on Wednesday night, two steps short of the glittering Champions League prize they craved, a string of missed chances away from shedding the reputation of chokers and nearly-men that hangs around their necks like millstones.Of the 'magic moments' that Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta and his midfield general Declan Rice had dreamed of and hoped for and mythologised on the eve of this semi-final second leg in the City of Light, there were none.Not for Arsenal anyway. Not until it was too late. By the time Bukayo Saka, their best player, pulled a goal back 15 minutes from time, PSG had put the tie out of reach with brilliant strikes from Fabian Ruiz and Achraf Hakimi.That does not mean Arsenal did not produce a performance to be proud of in a 2-1 defeat that left them 3-1 losers on aggregate. Their players poured their hearts and souls into this tie. All of them. And they outplayed PSG for swathes of the match, too. Their pressing was super-human, in the first half, in particular.They were heartbreakingly close to getting to their first Champions League final for 19 years but until Saka's 76th minute strike, they could not convert all their possession and dominance into goals. They missed chances they had to score. They were denied by the brilliance of PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.After everything, it came down to this: PSG took their chances. Arsenal did not. Not until the game was gone. They still lack that edge that makes the difference between triumph and disaster. They do not have a ruthless goalscorer. It is the most important skill of all and Arsenal lack it. It is why they were not good enough here. Declan Rice and Co found themselves up against a more clinical opponent in PSG Thomas Partey looked devastated to be on the losing side and was embraced by Mikel Arteta PSG players partied on the pitch after securing their place in the Champions League final If anything, their failure was a failure of recruitment. Arteta spoke afterwards of how Arsenal had been the better team for 160 minutes of the two legs. Even if that were true, it means little. They had chances that could have changed the game, chances that might have shaped a different destiny. They could not take them. Moments like those decide ties like this.Even after he had pulled one back, Saka missed a golden opportunity to score again, skying Riccardo Calafiori's cross over the bar. And so the debate about whether they were undone again by the lack of a conventional centre forward will rage on. It is something they must fix in the summer.For PSG, a date with Inter Milan in Munich at the end of the month and the chance to win their first Champions League awaits. All that remains for Arsenal now is the sad, desultory crawl to the end of the season and the imperative of holding on to a place in the top five.Some, in the midst of their disappointment, will call, absurdly, for Arteta to be sacked. That would be a huge mistake. There is much to be optimistic about for next season. Saka, William Saliba, Myles Lewis-Skelly, Declan Rice and Martin Odegaard can be the core of a team that breaks its drought next season.It was said last month that this Arsenal team had come of age when they beat Real Madrid home and away in the quarter-finals and looked hugely impressive doing so. Then, when they lost the first leg of the semi-finals against PSG last week, the siren voices started singing in their ears.Maybe Madrid aren't what they used to be. Maybe the win in the Bernabeu wasn't quite as significant as it seemed. Maybe it was another false dawn. Maybe, as Wayne Rooney suggested, Arsenal were afraid of putting everything on the line to win the biggest prize of them all.That seemed to be another way of saying that PSG are a better team than Real Madrid. Luis Enrique's side has been the best side in Europe in the second half of this season. Save a wobble in the second leg of their quarter-final against Aston Villa, they have looked irresistible.After the magnificent white-knuckle ride of Inter's victory over PSG at the San Siro on Tuesday evening, Arsenal knew they needed something exceptional of their own to make it into the final. Arteta said his team needed to 'elevate' itself to a new level. Achraf Hakimi scored with a powerful effort to put PSG 3-0 ahead on aggregate Bukayo Saka's goal had given Arsenal a glimmer of hope later in the game but it proved to be a mere consolation Mikel Arteta consoled Saka at full time, with the Gunners well beaten over two legs The atmosphere was electric and it was a cauldron for the Gunners to play in Fabian scored the opener for PSG after Arsenal had enjoyed a brilliant start to the match They had nearly got the dream start they craved. Jurrien Timber dispossessed Khvicha Kvaratskhelia on the edge of the PSG box in the third minute and crossed to the back post. Rice rose above Marquinhos six yards out but directed his header agonisingly wide.A minute later, Arsenal nearly scored again. Thomas Partey, who was so sorely missed in the first leg, launched a long throw into the box and Gabriel Martinelli met it on the run and on the volley a few yards out. Either side of Donnarumma and it would have been a goal but the ball was straight at him and Donnarumma produced a fine save to keep it out.

PSG missed the cleverness of the injured Ousmane Dembele, the closest thing they have to a talisman. Arsenal laid siege to the home goal in front of the Virage Auteuil where the ultras had bounced and yelled and roared in a riot of anticipation before the match. Now they were reduced to sullen whistles as the danger Arsenal posed them became evident.PSG hardly saw the ball. They were grateful to their goalkeeper again after seven minutes. Martin Odegaard unleashed a piledriver from the edge of the box that looked like a goal from the moment it left his boot but Donnarumma flung himself to his left to turn the ball wide. It was a world class save.When PSG finally broke free, they showed just how potent their own attacking threat can be. Kvaratskhelia made the chance out of nothing, stepping inside Timber 25 yards out and curling a beautiful shot beyond David Raya but off the face of the post. That reassured the home supporters. They found new voice.PSG gradually gained a foothold in the game and when Rice was booked for a foul on Kvaratskhelia on the left side of the Arsenal box, they sensed opportunity. Arsenal failed to clear Vitinha’s free-kick properly and Fabian Ruiz controlled 20 yards out and lashed an unstoppable shot past Raya via a deflection off Saliba.‘The Champions League is decided in the boxes,’ said Arteta.\\xa0‘The result should have been very different. I am so upset and annoyed that we didn’t do it.’\\xa0 The Spaniard connected sweetly after a corner was headed into his path on the edge of the box The PSG fans generated an extraordinary atmosphere and their side led at the break Gianluigi Donnarumma came up with some exceptional saves to deny the Gunners PSG will enter the final as favourites and Luis Enrique has them fantastically set up Martin Odegaard looked dejected at full time as he was embraced by his manager Arsenal thought they had found a way back midway through the half when Saka stepped inside Nuno Mendes on the PSG left and sent a left-foot shot arrowing towards the top corner. Once again, their hearts were broken by Donnarumma, who arched his back and pulled off a fantastic finger-tip save.Arsenal escaped the blow that might have extinguished their hopes completely when PSG were awarded a penalty because a shot from Achraf Hakimi had brushed Lewis-Skelly’s hand on the way through to Raya. VAR alerted the referee to it and he gave a penalty. It was ridiculously harsh and a measure of justice was served when Vitinha’s weak spot-kick was saved by Raya.\\xa0 It\\xa0was only a brief reprieve. Dembele came on and with his first touch, he played the ball into the path of Hakimi just inside the Arsenal box and Hakimi curled it past Raya into the bottom corner.Saka’s goal, taking the ball around Donnarumma, and squeezing the ball home, was nothing more than a consolation, even if his later chance might have changed things. Arsenal were close but not close enough.\", 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: PSG defeats Arsenal, advances to final\\nENTITIES: PSG, Arsenal, Luis Enrique, Inter Milan, Fabian Ruiz, Achraf Hakimi, Bukayo Saka, Gianluigi Donnarumma, Mikel Arteta, Declan Rice\\nEVENT: PSG defeated Arsenal 2-1 (3-1 on aggregate) in the Champions League semi-final, with goals from Ruiz and Hakimi, while Saka scored a consolation goal for Arsenal.\\nCONTEXT: PSG advances to Champions League final against Inter Milan.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 53940, 'sourceId': 12816, 'url': 'https://www.foxsports.com.au/motorsport/formula-one/alpines-management-mess-laid-bare-as-doohan-team-divide-costs-boss-his-job/news-story/32ac7e6ddabd658d421d4c5aa2a049a5', 'title': 'Doohan sacking twist as F1 basketcase’s new tumult exposed — with villain at chaotic centre', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T07:11:00.000Z', 'content': 'The Alpine meat grinder continues churning.In a remarkable twist in the opening months of the French team’s 2025 campaign, team principal Oliver Oakes, appointed only last August, has resigned with immediate effect.Executive adviser Flavio Briatore will take the reins of the French-owned, British-based team.Fox Sports, available on Kayo Sports, is the only place to watch every qualifying session and race in the 2025 FIA Formula One World Championship™, LIVE in 4K with no ad-breaks during racing.

Limited time offer.The news came just before confirmation Jack Doohan has been dropped for reserve driver Franco Colapinto from the next grand prix at Imola - but only for five races.“As part of an on-going assessment of its driver line-up, the team has made the decision to rotate one of its race seats for the next five rounds of the 2025 FIA Formula One World Championship,” the team said.“BWT Alpine Formula One Team therefore announces that Franco Colapinto will be paired with Pierre Gasly from the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, ahead of a new evaluation before the British Grand Prix in July.“Jack Doohan remains an integral part of the team and will be the first-choice Reserve Driver for this period of time.”While Oakes’s departure isn’t the announcement anyone was anticipating today, perhaps in retrospect it should have been expected.It’s just the latest in a long, long line of management reshuffles.Oakes was the team’s sixth team principal in as many seasons. Briatore, assuming his responsibilities, is its seventh — that’s one team principal every 9.5 months since 2020.Renault/Alpine team principalsCyril Abiteboul: 2016 to 2020 (Renault)Davide Brivio and Marcin Budkowski: 2021Otmar Szafnauer: 2022 to mid 2023Bruno Famin: mid 2023 to mid 2024Oliver Oakes: mid 2024 to mid 2025Flavio Briatore: mid 2025 (ongoing)This list doesn’t include the myriad other senior technical and other staff to have left the organisation since its 2021 Alpine rebrand.It also doesn’t include its leaky driver roster, from which Daniel Ricciardo, Fernando Alonso and Oscar Piastri have all departed on their own volition, in all three cases blindsiding the team.READ MORE Little makes sense in Aussie’s ruthless F1 axing... but he was always doomed from the startF1 team plunges into fresh chaos as Doohan axe sparks second exit no one saw comingNor does it consider Renault shuttering its historic engine plant in France, the company’s only continuous F1 thread to have survived its comings and goings from the sport over decades.In short, Enstone has been roiling for almost a decade, lacking the crucial consistency that builds up a team from the midfield into victory contention.The search for consistency is why Flavio Briatore was brought in as part of last year’s reshuffle. Operating at a strategic level above Oakes’s day-to-day remit, the experienced and title-winning executive was supposed to steady the ship.So much for that idea.PIT TALK PODCAST: Oscar Piastri wins his fourth race in five grands prix to extend his lead atop the drivers championship, and with McLaren scoring its biggest victory yet, is there any hope for anyone else in either title chase?INTERNAL FRICTION LAID BAREIt’s impossible to see Oakes’s departure as unconnected to the rumours swirling around Alpine’s unmoored driver line-up.It’s also impossible not to see the last six months in a new light as a result.Briatore has long been known to be the driving force behind his team’s pursuit of Colapinto dating back to rumours the French squad was pursuit the Argentine shortly after he made his debut for Williams last year, just weeks after Doohan signed his full-time contract for 2025.Briatore was subsequently reportedly instrumental in securing Colapinto on loan during the off-season.That move was never about anything other than giving Colapinto a race seat sooner rather than later. Williams boss James Vowles said as much.“The best chance he has is with Alpine as far as [getting on the grid],” he revealed during the pre-season, per ESPN. “That’s why he’s there.”But Doohan has always been understood to have the confidence of the team. He was impressive in his extensive private testing campaign, and his development work last year in the simulator was highly regarded, with former team boss Bruno Famin describing him as the “unsung hero” of the team’s turnaround from its worst start of this era.He’s an extremely hard worker and dedicated team player, and his elevation to the race team was seen as well deserved.But Briatore in his big-picture role saw things differently. There were uncertainties about Doohan’s ultimate potential, and his sponsor portfolio is relatively small.Colapinto, on the other hand, is a proven scorer and has a wealth of big-money sponsors.It must also be seen in the context of Briatore’s motivation to compete in Formula 1. From his first involvement in the 1990s to his departure in disgrace in 2009 — more on that below — he’s insisted that F1 must see itself as an entertainment business first and a sport second.Colapinto’s sponsorship is about more than just dollars; it’s a new, untapped business network to be capitalised upon.It’s lucrative enough that F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali has already raised the possibility of a return to Argentina.And Colapinto is bringing a new legion of fans to the sport too. The grandstands in Miami comprised a healthy Argentine contingent that had apparently bought tickets expecting their man to have secured a seat by now.How Piastri got Max to outbreak himself | 00:57But the clash of ideas appears to have led to friction between the executive and operational management, with a distinct impression a divide between Briatore and the race team on some matters.Oakes’s hedged responses to the constant rumours about Doohan’s status at the team now take on a new light.On the one hand Oakes was representing his team’s backing of the Aussie — with himself also reportedly defensive of Doohan’s position — but on the other he had he had to defer to his executive.“I think also he [Doohan] should be given a bit of space to just get on with it for a few rounds,” he said, per ESPN, during pre-season testing.“We’re here to go racing, we want the best driver in the car, the best engine in the car.“Flavio said it, didn’t he? We’re starting the season with Jack and Pierre [Gasly], and then let’s see how it all goes.”As recently as Friday in Miami — at which point Doohan appeared to have secured his seat until at least the mid-season break — Oakes attempted to walk both sides of the street.“We’ve been pretty open as a team that that’s just noise,” he said. “Jack needs to continue doing a good job, but it’s natural that there’s always speculation there.”“As it is today, Jack is our driver along with Pierre, We’ve been pretty clear on that. We always evaluate, but today that is the case.”The Race has reported that Briatore told Doohan on Sunday night that he would be axed. Oakes’s usual post-race media session was cancelled.A team principal without decision-making power is no team principal at all.There have been long-running suspicions that Briatore was pulling the strings all along. Now it’s official.“Having reviewed the opening races of the season, we have come to the decision to put Franco in the car alongside Pierre for the next five races,” he said on Wednesday.“With the field being so closely matched this year, and with a competitive car, which the team has drastically improved in the past 12 months, we are in a position where we see the need to rotate our line-up. We also know the 2026 season will be an important one for the team and having a complete and fair assessment of the drivers this season is the right thing to do in order to maximise our ambitions next year.“We continue to support Jack at the team, as he has acted in a very professional manner in his role as a race driver so far this season. The next five races will give us an opportunity to try something different and after this time period we will assess our options.”To be fair to Briatore, he’s a proven title-winning team boss, having taken Enstone under its previous guises to multiple drivers and constructors titles. He’s not in charge for nothing.But there’s also a reason he’d been out of the sport for 15 years before reappearing as executive adviser to the Renault CEO last year before springboarding his way back into the team’s top job.Norris gets testy after Miami Grand Prix | 02:16WHO IS FLAVIO BRIATORE?The Formula 1 paddock is home to more than a few colourful characters, but Briatore’s trumps the lot of them.Born in a small Italian town but with big ambitions, his journey to Formula 1 has traversed the worlds of insurance, hospitality and fashion. He’s been convicted of fraud more than once, at which point his path diverted to the Virgin Islands to avoid extradition back to Italy.Bizarrely it was a fortuitous detour. It was during his time in the US territory that he began working for Italian fashion mogul Luciano Benetton, for whom he rapidly ascended to manage the Benetton brand’s United States operationBriatore would say in a later in interview that it was during that time, in his late 30s, that he first considered himself wealthy.But life had one more dramatic change of course in store for the controversial Italian.It started, of all places, in Adelaide in 1988. It was the first time he saw Formula 1 in the flesh.He’d never been a fan, but Benetton had recently bought the Enstone-based Toleman team and wanted someone he trusted to run its commercial operations.Briatore accepted, but before long he was running the entire team.It was the start of a successful but controversial era.Existing staff were sacked to make way for external hires only for them to be sacked too and original staff to be brought back.His most notable poaching was Michael Schumacher. The German had made his debut with the Jordan team, but Briatore ruthlessly exploited a hole in his contract after just one race to bring him to Enstone.His arrival preceded key recruits, the names of whom long-term F1 fans will find instantly recognisable: Ross Brawn, Rory Byrne and Pat Symonds.It was a super combination for what rapidly turned into a super team. Schumacher won the 1994 championship, and he and the team did the title double in 1995.But the first of those titles remains controversial, and not just because of Schumacher’s last-race crash with Damon Hill that secured him the crown, over which opinions will forever be split.Benetton was accused of cheating more than once that season. The most memorable incident was the discovery of banned launch control software in the car’s ECU. The team didn’t deny the software existed but successfully argued that there was no proof it was ever used.It was subsequently found to have illegally removed the fuel filter from its refuelling equipment to slow down the flow rate as part of an investigation to Jos Verstappen’s fuel fire at that year’s German Grand Prix. The FIA World Motor Sport Council found the team guilty but let it off without punishment.Schumacher later revealed that the controversy of that season led to him exiting his contract a year early to join Ferrari.3 in a row! Piastri dominates in Miami | 03:27CRASHGATEDespite its remarkable titles, Benetton quickly fell into decline. Much of the super team followed Schumacher to Ferrari, where they formed an unstoppable championship-winning juggernaut.Briatore was removed from his post at the end of 1997 but didn’t leave F1, and when Renault bought the team ahead of the 2000 season, the Italian was brought back as team principal.With the backing of the French manufacturer, he identified his next Schumacher: Fernando Alonso, whom he still manages to this day.Alonso was the team’s test driver in 2002 and promoted to the race team the following season, when he claimed his maiden grand prix victory.By 2005 Alonso and Renault had won both titles, and when they went back to back in 2006 it seemed certain that a dynasty was on the cards.But again the project wobbled. Renault was considering leaving the sport — the eternal story of the French giant in F1 — and Alonso left the team for an ill-fated stint at McLaren.Michelin had also withdrawn from the sport ahead of 2007, leaving Bridgestone as the sole supplier at a time competition between tyre manufacturers had been an important performance differentiator.Alonso rejoined in 2008, but by then the rot had set in, and things were getting desperate.The team had just one podium after 14 rounds when the sport arrived in Singapore for the first-ever F1 night race.It was there that Briatore and Symonds cooked up a plan to guarantee an Alonso victory that might galvanise the team and ensure Renault’s continuing involvement.Alonso’s teammate, Nelson Piquet Junior, was instructed to crash at an opportune moment of the race, after Alonso had made a pit stop, to cause a safety car, jumble the field and move the Spaniard into the lead.It worked a treat, with Alonso scoring the team’s first victory in two years.It looked suspicious at the time, but it wasn’t until Piquet Junior was sacked the following year and spilt the beans that F1’s biggest ever cheating scandal was blown open.After a lengthy and high-profile investigation Briatore was banned from motorsport for life for orchestrating the scam. Symonds was excluded for five years.A French court would later overturn the bans, ruling them illegal.Symonds returned to the sport in an engineering consultancy capacity in 2011, later working for Williams, Sky Sports and Formula 1 itself before taking up his current position consulting for Cadillac’s 2026 entry.Briatore, however, his F1 brand toxic, kept his distance.“I don’t miss it, though,” he said in an interview with the UK Times in 2019. “It’s changing and is no longer the sport I knew.“It’s become very boring, very predictable.”Now back in the sport, his return is proving anything but boring and predictable.Whether that’s to Alpine’s benefit remains to be seen.', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Alpine turmoil: Oakes resigns, Doohan replaced\\nENTITIES: Alpine, Oliver Oakes, Flavio Briatore, Jack Doohan, Franco Colapinto, Pierre Gasly\\nEVENT: Alpine team principal Oliver Oakes resigned, with Flavio Briatore taking over, and Jack Doohan was dropped for Franco Colapinto for five races; this follows internal friction regarding driver selection and team direction.\\nCONTEXT: Briatore's return and influence are shaking up Alpine's driver lineup and management, prioritizing business and sponsorship over team stability.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 49958, 'sourceId': 12561, 'url': 'https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/juliana-aiden-martinez-octavio-pisano-law-and-order-svu-exits-rcna205339', 'title': \"Juliana Aidén Martinez, Octavio Pisano Exiting 'Law & Order: SVU'\", 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T15:57:02.000Z', 'content': 'As Season 26 of “Law & Order: SVU” comes to a close, so does the time on the show for two of its cast members.Octavio Pisano and Juliana Aidén Martinez will exit the series after the current season concludes, TODAY.com can confirm.

Today, they take on the AirPods Pro and set a new benchmark for premium wireless sound (and a Gizmodo Editor’s Choice).\\nIf you were considering buying these flagship earbuds, they are hitting an all-time low price on Amazon at just $189, down from $249 and $10 below even Samsung’s own official store where they’re on sale right now at $199. This is the best deal you’ll find on the Galaxy Buds3 Pro and it is the perfect moment to upgrade your audio experience.\\nSee at Amazon\\nWhy Are They Different?\\nThe Galaxy Buds3 Pro are designed for those who look for the best in sound quality and intelligent features. Samsung has completely redesigned them and gives them a more streamlined and ergonomic shape that will provide long-lasting comfort even after hours of listening. The silver colorway and unique Blade Lights give these earbuds a futuristic aesthetic, and they also provide an element of character.\\nInside, the Buds3 Pro are powered by Samsung’s most advanced audio hardware yet: They use a dual amplifier system (a woofer and tweeter that can be controlled independently) which offers a detailed soundstage with deep bass and clear highs. The enhanced two-way speaker system features a planar tweeter (a Galaxy Buds first) which picks up on every detail in your music for a high-resolution audio experience that’s among the best in the business.\\nWhat truly sets these earbuds apart is how they use Galaxy AI: Adaptive Equalizer uses artificial intelligence to measure the fit and position of both earbuds in real time and adjusts sound output according to your unique ear shape and listening habits. That guarantees you get the best audio however you wear them. Adaptive Active Noise Cancellation is fueled by Galaxy AI and intelligently eliminates background noise and lets in helpful sounds (like voices or sirens) when you need to hear them.\\nIt’s also intelligent communication: The Buds3 Pro provide real-time translation for face-to-face conversation and calls when paired with compatible Samsung devices using Galaxy AI. That renders them a godsend for travelers and for anybody who works in multilingual environments.\\nControls are intuitive and can be personalized with pinch and swipe gestures allowing you to adjust volume, play or pause music and launch your favorite applications-all without needing to touch your phone. The earbuds are made to be tough with an IP57 rating for dust and water resistance, and the charging case provides both USB-C and wireless charging. Battery life is strong with a charge lasting up to 7 hours of playback (and 26 hours autonomy including the charging case) and additional hours tacked on by the case.\\nIn short, the Samsung Galaxy Buds3 Pro are the contender for the best wireless earbuds of 2025. Coming with an all-time low price at Amazon and some really innovative AI-powered features (not to mention incredible sound quality), you shouldn’t miss this chance since the prices and the stock may not be at this point for too long.\\nSee at Amazon', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Galaxy Buds3 Pro: Better than AirPods Pro?\\nENTITIES: Samsung, Galaxy Buds3 Pro, AirPods Pro, Amazon\\nEVENT: Samsung's Galaxy Buds3 Pro are on sale at a record low price on Amazon, offering features surpassing AirPods Pro, including AI-powered adaptive audio and real-time translation.\\nCONTEXT: Galaxy Buds3 Pro offer advanced AI features, superior sound.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 53060, 'sourceId': 12713, 'url': 'https://gizmodo.com/andor-season-2-part-3-recap-ghorman-massacre-mon-mothma-2000598891', 'title': 'Andor‘s Finest Hours Just Delivered a Huge Gut Punch', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T17:55:44.000Z', 'content': \"The crisis on Ghorman explodes in this week's act of Andor season 2, and the whole galaxy must bear witness to its horrors.\\nWhat it takes to sustain a rebellion is brought into question in this week’s episode arc of Andor, which covers what happens two years before the main events of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and the original Star Wars saga. Thematically it’s time for the rebels to figure out if they want to just fight or actually win, as tensions come to a head on Ghorman in what’s probably the most gut-wrenching watch of the series, and perhaps even Star Wars as a whole. Having this be the episodic story that dropped on Revenge of the (May) Sixth made it extra powerful and a transmitted a timeless message of resistance when needed most. © Lucasfilm Ghorman is collapsing. Cassian (Diego Luna) and Wil (Muhannad Bhaier) are sent there to finally take out Dedra Mero (Denise Gough) as the front is pushing for action against the Imperial siege. They realize that in this moment they are not in alignment: Wil thinks it’s time to fight, and Cassian asserts that just fighting won’t secure a victory sooner if they’re not ready.\\nThe rebellion on Yavin is getting there but it’s not quite ready; however, they see tensions mount on Palmo Plaza with the Ghorman front knowing the time for peace is over as mining equipment arrives on the planet. Cassian understands that Luthen’s (Stellan Skarsgård) agenda here is at work with Ghorman being poised to “burn brightly,” and that taking out Dedra is to seal her death in its aftermath to prevent her from continuing her search for him as Axis. Wil is driven to help because she’s responsible for the death of their loved ones on Ferrix. She’s just been Luthen’s persistent threat as he orchestrates the rebellion. Mon Mothma’s increased surveillance for her opposition to the Emperor has iced her out of support. People across the Senate representing their populaces are afraid as they’ve seen what’s been happening to the Ghormans. It’s simply become untenable, whether or not they agree with the Imperial narrative that the Ghor have been acting out of character as savage opponents to the Imperial presence for the once-rich metropolis of fashion houses.\\nEveryone is afraid to catch the interest of the Empire and are too scared to speak up against the clear propaganda out of the civil unrest on Palmo. Mon knows that her purpose is changing and Genevieve O’Reilly’s performance masterfully captures that shift; her people are no longer on Coruscant and are waiting for her on Yavin. And yet as Mon is still respected, she begins to ponder what to do with her last shred of dignified reputation in the Senate. Before Cassian leaves to join the Ghorman Front and take out Dedra, he and Bix enjoy the quiet life on Yavin. Seeing Diego Luna and Adria Arjona imbue their rebel couple with moments that make what they’re fighting for all the more real and pressing gives the survivors of the Imperial colonization multitudes. There’s joy throughout the “flight or fight” life that makes it all worthwhile. Seeing that is important and poignant because anyone who is seeking freedom knows what peace can feel like even if it’s fleeting, and as days get harder the hope of it staying is what would keep anyone going. As they get rest Cassian lets Bix talk him into seeing a Force healer for an injury.\\n© Lucasfilm Pretty much until now, the Force not been specifically addressed, though you could argue its presence has been felt through the actions of the heroes and villains. The healer, a Saja if I had to guess, tells them that while some people carry their past and burdens, Cassian gathers as he goes as a messenger of purpose. And knowing what we know, it’s so impactful to see Bix come to the realization of Cassian’s destiny before he can. Arjona really says so much without a word in a powerfully stirring performance. Over the course of seasons one and two, Bix has become a steadfast rebel in ways we haven’t gotten to see previously, making a wonderful addition to the heroic women of Star Wars. There’s another moment between Bix and Vel (Faye Marsay) where they’re concerned about the recklessness of Luthen’s strategies, which resulted in the loss of Cinta for Vel. Seeing them determine that this man might only see them as pawns stands in stark contrast to what Draven (Alistair Petrie) and the Yavin rebels want for them and Andor. On Yavin their roles are essential and filled with responsibility to a larger community that needs their numbers. Like Cassian, they have been courted to evolve into reliable leaders, not just Luthen’s radical operatives. The Yavin rebels, once unorganized survivors on the fringe, have survived the wildness of the planet by realizing that working together is better. They have outgrown Luthen’s extreme methodology. It makes sense they’re wary of unsanctioned activities like Cassian and Wil taking off for more spy missions that could compromise the rebellion as it draws closer to being ready.\\nOn Ghorman, Wil and Cassian see how the Empire’s presence has motivated an affluent populace into doing whatever it takes, with Luthen’s influence over Rylanz’s (Richard Sammel) peaceful demonstrations beginning to take hold. It’s the sort of exploitation from the Empire that fed Luthen’s encouragement for them to take up arms. Wil and Andor perhaps begin to realize Luthen could have orchestrated a similar outcome on Ferrix, or got the idea to set a more visible demonstration on Ghorman. By this time Syril (Kyle Soller) has a soft spot for his friends on the Ghorman front and has been attempting to divert the Empire’s attention from his comrades. He’s been seeing the unjust moves against the Ghor firsthand and it’s not what he signed up for. Soller does an incredible job at depicting a man who committed his identity to the Empire—only to have that deteriorate when he sees that he’s not there to keep the rules from breaking, since the rule makers consistently manipulate them to their liking. This makes him question his loyalty to Dedra as she assures him they’ll be going home soon.\\xa0 Meanwhile, she’s bristling at the green and young Stormtroopers arriving, recognizing the difficulty in controlling them when the time comes to provoke the Ghorman rebels.\\n© Lucasfilm Rylanz finally figures out Syril’s true reason for being present at the Ghorman front’s meetings. While Syril naively thought he was there to police them, it’s understood he was there to be an informant to keep the Empire up to date on their actions for a more nefarious reason. It was never about wrong or right, it was about working the front into reaching a breaking point that could be used against them. The civil unrest gets pushed over the edge around them as the trap works. Syril feels played by Dedra for being manipulated into treating his friends unjustly. Andor gets a moment with that hotel receptionist who had helped him earlier, who reminds him\\xa0\\xa0“Rebellions are built on hope.” As the Palmo memorial plaza is under siege, the Ghormans try to reclaim it against Imperial regiments of stormtroopers—a sight that sends Syril over the edge. Syril rushes Dedra inside the ISB building and physically attacks her for what she’s done and for making him complicit. She reveals that it was always in the plans to deliberately trap the Ghormans into having no other choice but to act so they could be violently displaced. He finds out the truth about the kalkite needed for the project he was purposefully left out on by his girlfriend. A shocked Syril tells her good luck, as he seemingly aligns himself with the fate of the people he betrayed.\\xa0 Similarly, Cassian realizes Luthen played the Ghormans into walking right into that trap to get the Empire to employ violence and excuse it as a necessary defense. The exact outcome Luthen wanted all along was to show that even the most civilized and rich of places was not safe under the Empire’s rule; they ran a smear campaign for years to get the galactic leadership to turn against them. The casualties mount on Palmo square as Stormtroopers close everyone in. Andor presses on to complete his mission to assassinate Dedra but as he prepares for the shot, Syril sees him and is overtaken by his grief at losing his purpose.\\nThanks to that early in the series run-in with Cassian, which was truly his villain origin story, Syril lost his way. He ultimately decides to save Dedra by tackling Cassian. Violence breaks loose and in that moment, you realize Syril didn’t make a breakthough, he’s still a petulant manchild with a fragile ego who isn’t being redeemed. Cassian and Syril engage in hand to hand combat at the hotel lobby bar, culminating in a powerful moment where Syril has a blaster aimed at Cassian as he asks “Who are you?” It completely deflates Syril, who had made Andor this enemy in his head, when he was just like his Ghorman friends seeking the right to exist. Even as it maybe clicks, Rylanz shoots Syril point blank in the head—he didn’t overcome his bigotry in time.\\xa0 And Dedra, who can’t find Syril, ultimately breaks down. As the KX units are unleashed, there’s more casualties in the tragic extermination of the Ghorman people. Cassian just wants to get Wil and gets saved from a KX unit they end up running over. His young friend makes the difficult decision to stay behind and asks Cassian to tell their story. He agrees to and takes the KX pieces back with him. Transmissions from the scene go out describing the atrocities being committed as people call out for help as they hide. On Coruscant, the Ghorman ambassador is arrested. Mon Mothma prepares to address the Senate and speak out against Emperor Palpatine because enough is enough. Bail Organa agrees to support her by making a speech against the Emperor at his own risk. © Lucasfilm Cassian returns, and Kleya assigns him with extracting Mon from the Senate after her speech in case immediate retaliation is planned. Andor agrees but lets her know he’s done after that, and Kleya essentially says, “Yeah, sure.” He’s provided a cover as a journalist and heads to Coruscant. Mon discovers she’s been bugged as her time is running out. She also finds out her own assistant has been planted by Luthen, leaving her feeling alone and isolated. She has no one on Coruscant anymore and her family has distanced themselves. All she has left is the family of rebels waiting for her on Yavin. When Mon delivers the speech it’s masterfully glorious; all props to Andor creator Tony Gilroy. O’Reilly shines as the rebel leader ascendant and she utterly decimates Palpatine’s narrative and pins the Empire as behind behind the Ghormsn provocation to suit their nefarious end. “The death of truth is the ultimate victory of evil” she says to the Senate as she calls Palpatine the monster who will come for them all. The ISB try to lock down the building to get Mon as their agent is taken out by Andor. Her driver calls it in as he works for ISB too. Andor gets her out and kills for her; she’s shocked, but hey that’s the price of being in the rebellion now. The edge of your seat action is one of the most thrilling and satisfying sequences in all of recent Star Wars.\\nQuickly Mon and Andor bond over not trusting Luthen anymore and get on the same page. Mon trusts Andor and the risks he takes to get her out safe. This perfectly begins to set up their relationship in Rogue One. He delivers her to Kleya who informs him that she’ll be escorted by Yavin’s Gold Squadron and will make a speech upon arrival. Fans of Star Wars: Rebels know that her ship gets intercepted and the Ghost crew step in to help her get to the rebel base safely. It’s not an obvious call out but nice to have it be canonized. Mon doesn’t know how to thank Cassian and he tells her “Make it worth it.” Andor focuses on getting Wil to Yavin for help after Kleya delivers his friend to Coruscant injured but on the mend. Upon arrival Andor gives Draven the KX pieces and lets him know he’s not running missions for Luthen anymore. Andor and Bix reunite and he reiterates that he’s done. He’s done what he can, he’s done a lot, and he just wants a life with her. She listens as he explains that wants to find someplace quiet. “The only special thing about me is luck,” he says, and he feels he’s over played his hand. He wakes up the next morning and she’s gone. She leaves him a message that delivers him to his destiny to win—with the promise to find him when he fulfills his purpose in choosing the rebellion. Captain Andor rises and K2-SO wakes up.

And sadly, the physician involved continues to believe and convince the patients and families that they have a mysterious illness,” Lang said.Marrero took issue with the study and its findings in a statement.\\xa0“I am in profound disagreement with the study conclusions and have many questions regarding the methods and the content,” he said. “I am sure that our patients, families, and communities share the same very serious concerns.”Dr. Valerie Sim, an associate professor of neurology at the University of Alberta who wasn’t involved in the study, said there has been no proof that the patients’ illnesses are related. In fact, she said, the cases are “so broad in their description that we could all have this mysterious illness.”“Sadly, the one thing that all the patients have in common is the same neurologist,” Sim said. “And the patients who have been seen by other neurologists get a diagnosis of a known entity that’s not a mystery.”James Mastrianni, a neurology professor at the University of Chicago who wasn’t part of the research, said the study reinforces that “a second opinion by an expert in the field is often helpful.”An ongoing investigation\\xa0The mystery illness theory gained traction in 2021 when Canadian health authorities began investigating cases based on Marrero’s reports. But even after the investigation determined that most patients had known conditions, some families were skeptical. In November, the premier of New Brunswick, Susan Holt, called on the province’s health minister to conduct a scientific review “into the mystery brain disease.”\\xa0“New Brunswickers deserve answers,” Holt said in a statement last year. “We need to know what’s making us sick.”Some patient advocates now believe an environmental exposure is triggering the illnesses, claiming patients’ blood and urine tests show the presence of heavy metals, pesticides and rare antibodies that warrant further study.\\xa0“It wasn’t ever about whether a patient could have an alternative diagnosis,” said Kat Lanteigne, an advocate from New Brunswick. “It was what has triggered them to have this neurodegenerative disease?”Dr. Yves Léger, New Brunswick’s chief medical officer of health, said in a statement Wednesday that the new study “doesn’t change my Office’s intention to complete its own investigation into cases of undiagnosed neurological illness in New Brunswick.”His office has received 222 reports of cases identified as part of the cluster.Marrero said he has “evaluated more than 500 patients in this cluster, and provided a significant amount of unequivocal, sometimes critical environmental exposure evidences, as well as rare autoimmune markers in many of them.”But Lang said that just because a substance is in blood or urine doesn’t mean it caused someone’s neurological symptoms.“You don’t do a shotgun approach looking for anything and everything and then finding something and claiming it’s related to what the problem is,” he said.The challenge of diagnosing neurological issues\\xa0\\xa0Neurologists with no connection to the New Brunswick cases point to a few reasons advocates, doctors and government officials are still debating the cause of the illnesses.\\xa0For one, they said, accurate diagnoses can take time. And some of the conditions detected in the study, like Alzheimer’s, can have complex presentations.“It really takes a cohesive story from the family and a timeline to understand if someone is developing dementia. There can be confusing signs on a neurologic exam,” said Dr. Kimberly O’Neill, a neurologist in the NYU Langone Health Multiple Sclerosis Comprehensive Care Center.\\xa0One of the core symptoms used to identify the New Brunswick patients was rapidly progressing dementia. But families sometimes miss early signs of neurodegeneration, making it appear that dementia came on suddenly, Mastrianni said.Once debilitating symptoms arrive, patients and their families are often desperate for answers and may be reluctant to let go of the first diagnoses they get, Sim said.“We see this all the time in medicine, that patients gravitate to a diagnosis or a group entity,” Sim said. “That’s clearly what’s happening here.”The misdiagnoses are “really a tragedy,” she added, because patients could be missing out on treatments or proper care.Aria BendixAria Bendix is the breaking health reporter for NBC News Digital.', 'location': 'CAN', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Canadian brain diseases not a mystery after all\\nENTITIES: Dr. Alier Marrero, New Brunswick, JAMA Neurology, Dr. Anthony Lang, University Health Network’s Krembil Brain Institute, Dr. Valerie Sim, University of Alberta, James Mastrianni, University of Chicago, Susan Holt, Kat Lanteigne, Dr. Yves Léger, Aria Bendix\\nEVENT: A study refutes claims of a mysterious brain disease cluster in New Brunswick, attributing cases to known conditions like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

Scientists have discovered a way to transform cow dung into cellulose, one of the world’s most widely used materials.\\xa0“Our initial question was whether it could be possible to extract the tiny fragments of cellulose present in cow manure, which is left over from the plants the animals have eaten, and fashion it into manufacturing-grade cellulose material,” said Mohan Edirisinghe, senior author of the study, in a press release.\\xa0This new study, published in the Journal of Cleaner Production, introduces a cleaner, cost-effective method to extract cellulose that could help reduce pollution, support dairy farmers, and change how we think about animal waste.Turning Poop Into ProductsCellulose, found naturally in plant cell walls, has been a cornerstone of manufacturing since the 19th century. Once used in photographic film, it’s now found in cling wrap, surgical masks, food, pharmaceuticals, and more. Unfortunately, traditional synthetic production methods often rely on toxic chemicals for extraction.The method presented in the study offers a cleaner and more sustainable alternative. Researchers created a modified form of pressurized spinning, a manufacturing technology already in use that works via pressure and rotation to spin fibres, beads, ribbons, meshes, and films from soft matter.\\xa0This new technique, known as horizontal nozzle-pressurized spinning, is more energy efficient and requires fewer high voltages than other common production techniques.\\xa0Adapting current manufacturing techniques to accommodate this new process is expected to be relatively simple. However, the research team notes that the logistics of collecting and transporting large amounts of cow manure could be a more complex challenge. But even though it may be challenging, the benefits outweigh the costs.“Dairy farm waste, such as cow manure, is a threat to the environment and humans, especially through waterway pollution, the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere when it decomposes, and the spread of pathogens. It is also often a burden on farmers to dispose of properly,” said Yanqi Dai, first author of the study from UCL Mechanical Engineering, in the press release.Read More: Poop-Derived Fruits Are Known to Grow in Sewage PlantsCircular Economy in ActionThis technological innovation is a great example of the principles of the circular economy, a model focused on reducing waste and pollution by repurposing resources. By turning a problematic waste product into a valuable manufacturing material, the technology could simultaneously alleviate the burden on dairy farmers and reduce environmental harm from waste pollution and the toxic chemicals involved in making synthetic cellulose.The global stakes for these kinds of sustainable changes are high. A 2019 study projected that animal waste production will rise by 40 percent between 2003 and 2030, reaching over five billion tons. Many farms already produce more manure than they can use as fertilizer, leading to runoff that pollutes water, damages ecosystems, and even causes human disease.\\xa0The research team behind the new technology is actively exploring partnerships with dairy farmers to scale up this technology. If successful, the approach could transform a growing environmental liability into a sustainable, manufacturing asset.Read More: Turning Cow Poop Into Energy Sounds Like a Good Idea — But Not Everyone Is on BoardArticle SourcesOur writers at Discovermagazine.com use peer-reviewed studies and high-quality sources for our articles, and our editors review for scientific accuracy and editorial standards.

Stopping to catch her breath, she reveals to Mail Sport that she recently hung up her running spikes for a very special reason.‘I’ve actually not run for the last four months because we’re having another baby in the summer,’ she says, adding, ‘I stopped because I didn’t find it comfortable anymore.’The 800m runner announced her retirement from athletics over a year ago after a career marked by stunning successes but also by serious injury. But Sharp is not planning to stop training permanently any time soon.\\xa0In fact, rather than decreasing her mileage, she has just signed up for her first ever marathon, egged on by her friend and fellow Scots athlete Eilish McColgan, who took eighth place in her marathon debut in London two weeks ago.And this despite Sharp confessing that the half marathon she ran in 2024 — her longest ever distance — ‘almost killed me’. She said: ‘The last three miles were painful. But I really enjoyed having a goal.’ Lynsey Sharp's face says at all as the magnitude of her efforts at Glasgow 2014 take hold Sharp already has a son, Max, with her fellow athlete husband Andrew Butchart Sharp flies the Saltire after her career high Commonwealth silver at Hampden in 2014 In addition to relocating to Manchester last month with her husband, Dunblane-born athlete Andrew Butchart, looking after their son and preparing for a new baby, Sharp is busy studying for a Masters in sports marketing and media, has recently qualified as a coach, and is already weighing up her next career move.\\xa0She is brimming with ideas and enthusiasm — possibilities include a job in marketing for a sports brand, the media, being an agent and coaching young athletes.Sharp is warm, engaging and refreshingly outspoken, and it is clear retirement and motherhood have done nothing to dull the fiercely competitive spirit which helped propel her to a string of impressive achievements despite more than her fair share of injuries and illness.She freely admits that though she loves her ‘incredible’ son, giving birth to him does not compare to the high of winning races. ‘A lot of people say, “when your child’s born, that’ll be the best day of your life’,’ she says, adding: ‘For me, that experience, I wouldn’t say it was the best experience.’As the daughter of athletes (her mum, Carol, competed in the 1982 Commonwealth Games, and her dad, Cameron, was an elite 200 metre sprinter), Sharp says she is often asked if she will encourage her son to get involved in sport.‘I’ve had some fantastic experiences in my career, but I also know the other side of it, like how difficult it is to make it professionally as an athlete and how unstable it is,’ she says. ‘And then also how difficult it is at 30 to then have to retire and find something new. It will be up to him.’ The running power couple revealed their previous pregnancy over social media Sharp has spent the past year working for a financial services company and though she stresses ‘it was a fantastic experience, I genuinely learned a lot about myself’, she admits that it came as something of a culture shock to go from being out on the track to sitting at a desk five days a week.Her proudest moment was winning silver at the 2014 Commonwealth Games before a home crowd in Glasgow. The race was dubbed ‘a miracle’ because Sharp had been violently ill with norovirus the night before and had been rushed to the hospital in the Commonwealth Games village. Despite a sleepless night spent vomiting, she got out of her hospital bed the next morning determined to go ahead with the race. ‘There was absolutely no way that I was going to miss it,’ she says, looking back.In the event she pulled off a sensational run, coming from behind to take second place in a nail-biting finish. ‘The power of the crowd got me through that race,’ she says. ‘It was like they were my superpower pushing me down the track.’ Two weeks later she picked up another silver medal at the European Championships in Zurich, with a time of 1:58.80. ‘2014 was like the dream year for me,’ she said.That year might have been the high point of her career, but it was against medical advice that she competed at all that season after surgery for a calf injury left her with a chronically infected wound, which was so serious Sharp was in a wheelchair and feared she might lose her foot. Despite having been laid low the night before, Sharp rejoices at the finish line in 2014 ‘Decisions like that come with experience,’ she says. ‘As an athlete, you start to know your body. And you know when you can push the boundaries and when you can’t.’Two years before that, she won silver at the European Championships in Helsinki behind Russian athlete Yelena Arzhakova. But Sharp was later declared the race winner after the Russian was suspended for two years after testing positive for a banned substance. Sharp was delighted with the win but admitted that the circumstances took the sheen off her victory.Running her personal best of 1:57.69 in the 800m at the 2016 Olympics in Rio was another highlight, though the event was again marred by controversy. Sharp came sixth in the race, which was won by Caster Semenya, the South African athlete born with differences of sexual development (DSD), who dominated her sport between 2009 and 2019.Asked after the race how she felt about competing against hyperandrogenic, or intersex, athletes, Sharp said ‘it was difficult to compete against Caster Semenya and other hyperandrogenic athletes after the rule to suppress testosterone levels was overturned.’ Sharp's European Championship silver medal in 2012 was upgraded to gold after Russia's Yelena Arzhakova was found guilty of a doping offence Francine Niyonsaba of Burundi took silver in the race and Kenya’s Margaret Wambui won bronze — all three women were born with DSD and were later revealed to have had elevated testosterone levels.There were calls from some quarters to strip the winners of their medals. But all three athletes competed within the rules in place at the time, after the International Olympic Committee took the controversial decision in 1999 to abandon compulsory gender verification, making it possible for intersex athletes to compete without testosterone suppression.Though she was far from the most outspoken athlete, Sharp found herself caught up in the media storm surrounding Semenya, who was reported as female at birth but underwent male puberty. Sharp was attacked on social media, was subjected to threats and warned never to set foot in South Africa.\\xa0Looking back on it, Sharp said, ‘It was a really difficult situation. It felt like the governing bodies could had dealt with it better.’The controversy continues. New rules were introduced in 2023 which stated that anyone who has undergone male puberty is barred from the female category, after research found that, even after taking medication to suppress their testosterone, trans women retained an advantage in strength, endurance, power and lung capacity. Sharp and Semenya exchange a frosty handshake during the 2017 World Championships In February this year, World Athletics, the governing body which oversees the sport globally, approved the introduction of a test to determine if an athlete is biologically female, due to ‘new evidence which clarifies there is already an athletically significant performance gap before the onset of puberty.’In her 2023 autobiography, Semenya criticised Sharp, whom she had been competing against since they were juniors, characterising her as a sore loser and accusing her of behaving badly. She wrote, ‘Sharp looked at me as though I was less than human.’Every time the issue is back in the spotlight, Sharp says that her name and 2016 comments are dragged up again. It’s ironic that, as a law undergraduate at Edinburgh’s Napier University, Sharp wrote her dissertation on this very subject, titled ‘Intersex Athletes in Sport: The Regulatory Framework, and the Legal Implications.’Sharp would like to put the subject behind her. ‘I don’t follow what goes on anymore. I don’t have any interest in the discussion. It’s a debate that’s going to go on for years and years to come. No one’s winning. It’s just a really complicated situation.’In 2019, Sharp took a break from athletics after surgery to remove pre-cancerous cells detected during a routine smear exam. She talks with regret about the ‘wasted years’ during Covid when she, in common with other athletes and sportspeople the world over, continued to train hard but could not compete.‘No one was able to do anything, the Olympics got postponed and sadly, as an athlete, the clock’s ticking, you’re getting older and the more little niggles and injuries I got, the more fed up I got.’ Sharp's father Cameron won a total of one gold and five bronze Commonwealth Games medals After she gave birth to her son in 2021, she returned to athletics but six months later her training was thrown off course when she got a stress fracture in her sacrum, a bone at the base of the spine, a common injury in female athletes post-partum. By the time she came back in 2023, she had missed three seasons. She raced indoors and outdoors that season but, by the end of the summer, she knew instinctively that the time had come for her to retire.Finances played a part in her decision after her sponsorship agreement with Adidas ended and she was dropped from funding by British Athletics. ‘Adidas didn’t renew my contract,’ she explains. ‘So, there was only so long that I felt like I could carry on doing it, not making any money.‘I found that I can’t pay out for childcare to do something, you know, and I’m not getting paid to do it. So, I think physically I probably could have carried on for a couple more years, but such is life.’Ultimately, she is thankful that she wasn’t forced out by injury. She adds: ‘In my athletics career, I worked so hard day in, day out, and it was amazing when you got the results, but that’s a small percentage of the amount of time that you felt you put in the work and didn’t get the results. So, the highs were great, but the lows were terrible.’Does she feel a sense of relief that some of that pressure is behind her now?‘Sometimes I miss it, and then sometimes I’m like, “oh, I’m really glad I don’t have to do that anymore, and no one’s checking how fast I’m running, or judging my performances”,’ she says. ‘But when you’ve done it for so long, you crave that. I’m very results driven, and performance focused, and it’s hard to replicate that in life outside of athletics.’ The Sharp clan - dad Cameron, mum Carol and daughters Lynsey and Carly - pictured in 1997 Athletics was never a given for Sharp. Her parents — who met at Moray House in Edinburgh when they were training to become PE teachers — never pressured her to follow in their footsteps, and always encouraged her to have a fall-back career. At Mary Erskine, a private school for girls in the Scottish capital, Sharp enjoyed playing hockey and skied at Hillend dry ski slope.It was through her older sister that she became increasingly drawn to athletics. She has always been fiercely competitive and gravitated towards athletics partly because she enjoyed it but mostly because she was good at it.She reveals that her career was almost derailed before it got started. She explained: ‘I had quite a few injuries when I started university, and I can so clearly remember walking on the beach in Rothesay with my mum.\\xa0'And I was injured at the time and missed the summer season, and I turned to her and I was like, “I don’t know if I want to do this anymore”. Within two years of that, I made my first Olympic team in London. Sharp looks back with pride on a career that had highs, lows and so many incredible memories ‘There are so many people that are lost to sport through that. But I was fortunate enough to have people on my team that encouraged me to stick at it, and it was definitely worth it.’She isn’t sure how the next few years will pan out but says she is learning not to look too far ahead. Motherhood has made her a better person, she says. ‘It forces you to slow down. As an athlete you are selfish, you put yourself first and you spend a lot of time on your own — travelling and training.\\xa0 'And you’re always like, what’s next, what do I want to achieve, where am I going? As a mum you learn to let your child enjoy what they’re doing, and just like be in the moment. It’s very different.’Laughing, she recalls a recent conversation she had with her mum, ‘Max at the moment is not great at losing. And it’s awful because that was me when I was a kid and I recently asked my mum, “when did I grow out of that?” She said, “I’m not sure you did”.’\", 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Lynsey Sharp Expecting Baby No. 2, Reflects\\nENTITIES: Lynsey Sharp, Andrew Butchart, Eilish McColgan, Commonwealth Games, Olympics\\nEVENT: Former Olympian Lynsey Sharp announces second pregnancy, reflects on athletics career after retirement, and plans marathon.\\nCONTEXT: Sharp reflects on career highs/lows, balancing motherhood/training.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 53141, 'sourceId': 12737, 'url': 'https://www.film-news.co.uk/news/UK/118320/Ferris-Bueller-s-Day-Off-in-talks-to-reunite-in-remake-of-French-comedy', 'title': 'Ferris Bueller’s Day Off in talks to reunite in remake of French comedy', 'publishDate': '2025-05-08T07:00:00.000Z', 'content': '\\'Ferris Bueller’s Day Off\\' co-stars Matthew Broderick and Alan Ruck are in talks to reunite in the comedy \\'The Best Is Yet to Come\\'.\\nThe flick has a script by Allan Loeb; the screenwriter and producer known for films such as \\'Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps\\', \\'The Switch\\', and \\'Things We Lost in the Fire\\'.\\n\\'Cool Runnings\\' helmer Jon Turteltaub is on board to direct.\\nPer Deadline, the actors will \"play best friends who, through a colossal misunderstanding that creates a ticking clock, hop in a car to find the estranged son of one of them and also try to do all the things that life has prevented them from doing.\"\\nThe film is a remake of the 2019 French comedy-drama of the same name directed by Alexandre de La Patelliere and Matthieu Delaporte.\\nLionsgate is in talks to distribute the movie.\\nAlthough the finer details are still to be finalised, the outlet claims production could begin as soon as the summer.\\nBroderick and Ruck played the titular role and Cameron Frye, respectively, in John Hughes’ 1986 teen comedy \\'Ferris Bueller’s Day Off\\', which follows Ferris Bueller, a charismatic high school senior who fakes an illness to skip school and embark on an adventurous day in Chicago with his best friend, Cameron, and his girlfriend, Sloane, including accidentally crashing his father\\'s beloved 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder through a glass window, a major turning point in his character’s arc.', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' stars reunite\\nENTITIES: Matthew Broderick, Alan Ruck, Allan Loeb, Jon Turteltaub, Alexandre de La Patelliere, Matthieu Delaporte, Lionsgate, John Hughes\\nEVENT: Matthew Broderick and Alan Ruck are in talks to reunite in 'The Best Is Yet to Come', a remake of a French comedy, about two best friends embarking on a road trip to find one's estranged son.\\nCONTEXT: Reunion of 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' stars in remake.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 53391, 'sourceId': 12762, 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/may/08/the-wrong-gods-review-absorbing-drama-tackles-dark-chapter-in-indias-history', 'title': 'The Wrong Gods review – absorbing drama tackles dark chapter in India’s history', 'publishDate': '2025-05-08T02:04:32.000Z', 'content': 'Having made his name with the hugely successful Counting and Cracking – an epic three-hour work spanning multiple generations and featuring a massive set, 16 performers and many more characters – the Sydney playwright S Shakthidharan has downsized in his latest play. The Wrong Gods covers just seven years over 100 minutes, with four actors on an almost bare stage. But do not be deceived: this is an ambitious work with big ideas on its mind. It tilts at nothing less than the history of capitalism and impacts of modernity.Our setting is riverside in a valley in India, surrounded by a bountiful forest – a kind of prelapsarian paradise. Here we meet Nirmala (Nadie Kammallaweera, the star of Counting and Cracking and its sequel, The Jungle and the Sea), a farmer and the head of her village’s council, and her precocious teen daughter, Isha (Radhika Mudaliyar, another Counting and Cracking alum), an aspiring scientist.Nirmala, whose ancestral roots in the valley stretch generations, believes in the old, pre-Hinduism gods – and in particular the goddess: the river. Isha does too, though her voracious mind is already questioning these belief systems and questing for greater truths. Isha longs to escape back to school in the city. Nirmala, newly abandoned by her husband, needs her daughter home to help work their patch of land. The two quarrel over their competing values and visions of the world, as mothers and daughters often do.A greater struggle is afoot: Nirmala is anxiously awaiting the arrival of “big fat American” developers who have greedy eyes on the village, and prays to the goddess to send them packing. Isha prays to the goddess to let her go with them, back to her teacher and educational champion, Miss Devi (Manali Datar). And then, as if teleported from another dimension, Lakshmi (Vaishnavi Suryaprakash) arrives: a middle-class smooth-talker with an offer too good to refuse – and a magic packet of seeds that promises high yields with low labour. Nirmala can prosper; Isha can go to school.Worshipping different gods: Nirmala (Nadie Kammallaweera), Isha (Radhika Mudaliyar) and Lakshmi (Vaishnavi Suryaprakash). Photograph: Brett Boardman Photography/BelvoirIf this smacks of fairytale or myth, it’s by design and clearly telegraphed by the play’s elemental set (its stone surfaces and moss-tipped concentric circles evoking an ancient amphitheatre) and by the dialogue: Isha, it is explained, is the goddess of destruction; Lakshmi is the goddess of wealth. But there may be other clues here too: in Sanskrit, Isha means strength, guardian or protector; Nirmala means virtuous.\\nSign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning\\nThe Wrong Gods is doing double duty, working as a fable of capitalism and modernity, and as a primer on a specific chapter of Indian history: the government-sponsored Green Revolution of the 1960s and 70s, and its devastating impacts. Nirmala’s village is a microcosm of a devilish pact in which an estimated 50 million farmers and Indigenous people were displaced by a network of dams that promised water for the cities, at the expense of natural environments and civilisations thousands of years in the making.At the same time, the Indian government and foreign companies induced farmers to abandon old crops and methods for new high-yield varieties of wheat and corn, and synthetic fertilisers. This also came at a cost, sending millions of farmers into crushing debt cycles that spawned suicide epidemics, and upended delicate ecosystems with far-reaching consequences.The Wrong Gods was inspired by one of the centres of this modern tragedy: the Narmada Valley, site of the Sardar Sarovar dam network – dubbed “India’s greatest planned environmental disaster”. It was also the birthplace of one of India’s most successful civil resistance movements: Narmada Bachao Andolan.Isha, Nirmala and Lakshmi look on as Devi (Manali Datar) takes the floor. Photograph: Brett Boardman Photography/BelvoirShakthidharan spent time in the valley more than a decade ago, and The Wrong Gods offers an imagined origin story for Narmada Bachao Andolan, which was substantially led by women. Perhaps in tribute to this, not only the cast and characters but almost the entire creative team of this production, which Shakthidharan co-directs with Belvoir resident Hannah Goodwin, are women.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionLike many contemporary plays of ideas, The Wrong Gods suffers occasionally from speechifying and on-the-nose lines, with scenes interrupted as characters spout exposition. The extent to which audiences tolerate this may depend on how much they know of the real-world issues.The play is generally successful, however, in bringing a massive, intractable problem down to the human scale, showing the emotions and interpersonal dynamics – and primal survival instincts – behind this epic tragedy.The performances are great and special credit goes to Kammallaweera and Mudaliyar, who swiftly and surely bring the mother and daughter to endearing life and make us believe the relationship on to which the play’s big ideas are scaffolded. Goodwin and Shakthidharan keep the drama dynamic and engaging, and pare back aesthetics and action so as to not overwhelm the text.The result is an absorbing drama – though fans of Counting and Cracking may wish Shakthidharan lent a little less on neat parable and a little more into the human mess.\\nThe Wrong Gods runs until 31 May at Belvoir St Theatre in Sydney and from 6 June to 12 July at Melbourne Theatre Company as part of the Rising festival', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Play tackles India's Green Revolution tragedy\\nENTITIES: S Shakthidharan, Nadie Kammallaweera, Radhika Mudaliyar, Vaishnavi Suryaprakash, Manali Datar, Hannah Goodwin, Narmada Bachao Andolan, Belvoir St Theatre, Melbourne Theatre Company\\nEVENT: Play 'The Wrong Gods' examines the history of capitalism and modernity through the lens of India's Green Revolution, focusing on the displacement of farmers and environmental damage caused by dams and new agricultural methods.

Of course we should consider quotas', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T06:03:33.000Z', 'content': 'The result of the federal election was shocking but it wasn’t surprising.It was a resounding message from voters – and we would be foolish not to listen.The truth is, the Liberal party didn’t lose because of campaign tactics or some leadership missteps alone. We lost because our policies failed to resonate. And they failed to resonate because, too often, they were built without the input of the very Australians we needed to win over – women, young people, multicultural communities and urban voters.Too many of our policies seemed disconnected from the daily realities of modern Australia. The cost of living, housing, secure jobs, climate and education are dominating the concerns of millions – yet when asked how we’d address them we gave voters little reason to believe we understood the scale of the problem, let alone have credible answers.To chart a credible path forward, we must return to first principles. The Liberal party was once defined by its broad reach – a party of the “forgotten people”, where aspiration met compassion and economic freedom was balanced by social responsibility. That legacy, championed by the party founder Robert Menzies, meant putting the concerns of ordinary Australians at the centre of political life.We have drifted far from that foundation. Too many Australians now see us as departed from the centre, and speaking to a narrowing segment of the population, not to them.The lack of women in our ranks is not just a political liability – it’s a structural failure. Women make up more than half the population yet remain dramatically underrepresented in our party, from branch level to the parliament itself. Of course we should be considering quotas. This is not about ticking boxes – it’s about removing entrenched barriers and making space for talent we have long overlooked. A necessary circuit breaker at a veritable crisis point where organic growth hasn’t materialised.Quotas are not foreign to the Liberal party. We already use them. Every party branch and conference must elect both a male and a female delegate to vote in Senate and upper house preselections. We have quotas for metropolitan and regional members of our state executive. We have quotas for male and female vice-presidents.The Coalition itself operates as a quota-based model: ministerial and shadow ministerial positions are shared between the Liberals and Nationals according to negotiated agreements. The leader of the Liberal party is our prime minister in government and the leader of the National party is our deputy prime minister – a power-sharing arrangement by design.But improving representation isn’t just about numbers. It’s about culture. Women should feel that they belong in the Liberal party – not as a gesture or a fix, but because their perspectives are essential to how we govern. If women don’t feel heard, valued or safe in our ranks they won’t stay – and voters will continue to turn away from us, too.The same is true for young Australians, multicultural Australians, and city dwellers. Too often they were dismissed as too hard to reach, when in fact, the message itself was the problem.Their concerns are real. They want secure work, a shot at buying a home, meaningful climate action and a system that doesn’t leave them behind. These challenges can be solved through true adherence to Liberal values. But they won’t be solved if we vacate the field.That is a recipe for disaster, where we offer no reason for frustrated Liberals to return; direct swing voters away and close the door to potential future cohorts of supporters.This election loss was not some kind of anomaly. It was a clear judgment on our relevance and resonance with the electorate. It’s not just that we didn’t win – it’s that voters didn’t see themselves reflected in our policies, our people or our priorities.Rebuilding starts with humility. It starts with broadening our base, modernising our policy agenda, and cultivating a culture that welcomes and elevates a wider range of voices. We don’t need to become a different party. We need to become a better version of the party we were meant to be.Australians are asking for leadership that is competent, compassionate and connected to their lives. If we are serious about governing again we must rebuild trust – not with slogans or short-term campaign commitments, but with substance.That work must begin now.\\nMaria Kovacic is a Liberal senator for New South Wales', 'location': 'AUS', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Liberal party needs more women, diversity\\nENTITIES: Maria Kovacic, Liberal party, Robert Menzies, Nationals\\nEVENT: Liberal party lost election due to policy failures.\\nCONTEXT: Liberal party must broaden base, modernize policies.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 47156, 'sourceId': 891, 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/business/media/dear-media-podcasts.html', 'title': 'Is Dear Media’s Podcast Network the ‘Manosphere’ for Women?', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T09:01:16.000Z', 'content': 'You have a preview view of this article while we are checking your access.

As listeners, they slightly outnumber women, too. “Brocasters” and the “manosphere” have even become a media obsession, and for good reason. During the election, conservatives successfully tapped into a world of dude-driven content to reach disengaged voters.But there has been a surge of podcasts made by women, for women, too. And a company called Dear Media is at the center of much of it.Based in Austin, Texas, Dear Media operates the largest network of podcasts for women. Its nearly 100 shows are as freewheeling and chummy as those in the “manosphere,” similarly hosted by comedians and content creators. Except here, Joe Rogan’s alpha masculinity and Logan Paul’s unabashed idiocy are swapped for girlboss confidence and therapy speak.Gone, too, is the overt conservatism that now blankets the manosphere — but not all of its ideas. Dear Media emphasizes health and wellness in its programming, at times dipping into the same kind of contrarian thinking that powers Make America Healthy Again, the agenda of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.Some of its shows are hosted by medical doctors. Others promote raw milk, parasite cleanses and communicating with angels. There is a do-your-own-research ethos, already familiar to those who follow “MAHA” or even Goop. But here, it is slid between dating diaries and reality-television recaps.This range is working. In 2024, Dear Media reached No. 7 on Apple Podcasts’ list of top channels, alongside media juggernauts like iHeart, SiriusXM and The New York Times. This year, it debuted a Khloe Kardashian show on X and acquired “The World’s First Podcast,” which inspired a hit Netflix romantic comedy. And its success could open the door for more networks to embrace women’s interest in alternative health.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Now I Respond With 4 Words\", 'publishDate': '2025-05-08T05:00:02.000Z', 'content': '“She’s beautiful. Oh, but aren’t you absolutely exhausted?” My neighbour lovingly asked as she smiled at my five-month-old daughter in her stroller. “Actually, no. I’m great,” I replied. My neighbour shot me an incredulous look like I was lying. “Oh, wow, well look at you!” It wasn’t the first time I’d experienced this kind of exchange (with a neighbour, acquaintance or even a stranger) since I had my baby. I’d heard this question daily – sometimes asked to me, other times stated as a comment. After we finished exchanging pleasantries, I was left pondering the question, and the disbelief at my seemingly unnatural response. The depiction of the emotionally and physically exhausted parent – especially the mum – is ubiquitously portrayed in our society in movies, television and across social media. Sometimes me and my husband were together with the baby, but the question of sleep still got directed my way.This stereotype is steeped in some truth. New parents are often more tired than other humans. But a study in Sage Journals in 2019 found mothers experienced more fatigue and stress than fathers. For the first few months, through newborn night feeding, I can attest to that experience. “Was I the picture of sleep health, or getting the recommended amount per night? Definitely not. But I also wasn’t miserably exhausted to the point of venting to anyone who said hello.”While my daughter spent the first month of her life in the NICU, I was back home, pumping around the clock, every three hours, and bringing it back and forth to the hospital. Most nights, I barely stayed awake to the lights and sounds of old mystery shows like Murder, She Wrote and Columbo while I pumped milk for my new daughter. Once she arrived home, I still pumped almost nonstop, but my husband relieved me of some of the responsibilities. At 11pm I’d leave him with a supply for the overnight shift. I caught up on sleep till the baby woke up at 6:30 in the morning. Was I the picture of sleep health, or getting the recommended amount per night? Definitely not. But I also wasn’t miserably exhausted to the point of venting to anyone who said hello. Different paths to parenthoodWhen I first got pregnant naturally at 37 after four months of trying, I couldn’t believe my luck. It ended tragically at 18 weeks, followed by a much earlier miscarriage during the pandemic two years later. In 2021, I finally turned to IVF, thinking it would be an easy answer. But every cycle failed. An unsuccessful embryo transfer felt like a literal death. I went through nine rounds of IVF until I had my miracle baby at 43. When my daughter finally arrived, I felt especially committed to parenthood. Joy seemed to supersede the impending stress from nonstop feeds. Even in moments of stress and fatigue, which there were plenty of, I felt completely overcome with gratitude when I looked at my baby daughter. Of course I was tired, and had moments of stress. I was a brand new parent. I also admittedly had a newborn who slept well. Early months of round-the-clock feedings turned into a baby who could mostly get through the night without waking up. But that stereotype of the worn-out, defeated newborn mum I’d seen all over Instagram wasn’t my experience thus far. Apparently it was my lack of complaining that perplexed everyone. We have new norms of achieving parenthood by methods other than spontaneous conception. Yet, our view of motherhood remains fairly one-dimensional. Our society has centred one image of what being a mother is like – which doesn’t leave much space for other stories. miodrag ignjatovic via Getty ImagesPeople who experience fertility trauma might actually build up their tolerance level for early caretaking that others (who didn’t have that extra time) may not possess.My experience isn’t uncommon. It’s simply less studied (as of now), and not as widely discussed. Plenty of research has been done on the mental distress of couples who are affected by infertility experience. Yet, studies on the difference in well-being and life satisfaction after successful IVF is, in contrast, sparse. A study in the Human Fertility Journal found that couples who had babies through IVF were often more positive and happier than those who conceived naturally. Some reasons hypothesised were the extra support that couples who go through IVF receive and a greater level of satisfaction after trying for a long time.Last fall, the Netflix movie Joy told the story of the pioneers of IVF in the 1970s and the first IVF baby, Louise Joy Brown. The film’s creator, Rachel Mason, drew inspiration from her own infertility story. Mason did IVF seven times before having her son, and said in an interview while promoting the movie, “subconsciously, when you’ve fought for it, I think you enjoy it more”.When I interviewed Robyn Koslowitz, Ph.D., a psychologist and parenting educator, for this story, she explained, “our suffering points us to the preferred life we’d like to have. It ultimately clarifies our values and priorities”. Her upcoming book Post-Traumatic Parenting: Break the Cycle and Become the Parent You Always Wanted to Be describes the ways trauma can work as a superpower. Fertility trauma can build up a tolerance level for early caretaking that others who didn’t have that extra time may not possess. My struggles with fertility prepared me in advance for many of the challenges of parenting. The six years I had to work on myself taught me resilience and instilled a fortitude in me that gave me new confidence. That sense of accomplishment and knowing I could do difficult things would serve as a useful tool while raising my daughter. “My struggles with fertility prepared me in advance for many of the challenges of parenting. The six years I had to work on myself taught me resilience and instilled a fortitude in me that gave me new confidence.”“It makes navigating the hard stuff a little easier, because you know you’ve done it once before,” Koslowitz told me. “If what you went through makes you less afraid as a result, that’s a superpower.” A 2024 Norwegian study – the largest to date comparing trends in parents who conceived through ART (Assisted Reproductive Technology) versus naturally – found that having a baby via IVF was associated with lower levels of anxiety and depression. It illustrates that the negative emotions endured in infertility don’t always continue into pregnancy or parenthood. An important aspect of these increased feelings of positivity is overwhelming gratitude. That dark period of wanting to be a mum has passed. But deep within me lies the knowledge that this could easily also not have happened. A lot of IVF is simply luck (though influencers may not want people to believe that). That understanding is why I’ll never take my parental status for granted. Finding joy in even the stressful moments of mothering isn’t about perpetuating toxic positivity, or implying others are ungrateful. It’s about owning my own gratitude and leading with it – even in moments of stress – like baby’s sleep schedules. Michelle Bias, a trauma expert with a master’s degree in transpersonal psychology, said my grief and gratitude are linked. She defined this as a “deep reverence for the gift of life”.“Our past fully feeds into our experience as mothers. It’s a life force pushing us forward, and what we learned systematically impacts how we parent.”‘Motherhood is not one-size-fits-all’Everyone seemed to want me to wear my new title of mother like a badge of honour, as if not admitting to exhaustion meant I wasn’t doing something right. Being overwhelmed was what people understood. “We fit mothers into familiar roles we see them play, and the societal expectations, like exhaustion – which we put solely on them – perpetuate these cultural narratives,” said Bias. “The world isn’t ready to leave room for different maternal experiences. The reply of your positive experience reframed it in a way people weren’t used to hearing, and left them unsure how to express themselves. We need to realise that motherhood is not one-size-fits-all.” Now when I’m asked formulaic questions – which I get less with an 11-month-old, but still hear frequently – I’ve learned how to shift the conversation. Koslowitz defined it as a “one-liner response that honours my experience, without pushing myself into the box that’s been presented to me.” Similarly, Bias suggested asking a question in return. For now, when people ask me if I’m sleeping, I respond with four words: I’m enjoying the journey.', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: IVF parents find joy, gratitude in motherhood\\nENTITIES: Robyn Koslowitz, Michelle Bias, Rachel Mason, Louise Joy Brown\\nEVENT: Author shares her experience with IVF and motherhood, finding joy despite challenges.\\nCONTEXT: IVF parents may experience more gratitude, less exhaustion.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 53518, 'sourceId': 12771, 'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c30q09638n8o', 'title': 'Kashmir: Why India and Pakistan fight over it', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T14:52:07.000Z', 'content': '23 hours agoReutersKashmir has been a source of conflict between India and Pakistan for decadesNuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan have fought two wars and a limited conflict over Kashmir. But why do they dispute the territory - and how did it start?What we know about India\\'s strike on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered KashmirIndian air strikes - how will Pakistan respond? Four key questionsLIVE: Tensions escalate as Pakistan vows response to Indian strikes after Pahalgam killingsHow old is this conflict?Kashmir is an ethnically diverse Himalayan region famed for the beauty of its lakes, meadows and snow-capped mountains.Even before India and Pakistan won their independence from Britain in August 1947, the area was hotly contested.Under the partition plan provided by the Indian Independence Act, Muslim-majority Kashmir was free to accede to either India or Pakistan.The maharaja (local ruler), Hari Singh, initially wanted Kashmir to become independent - but in October 1947 chose to join India, in return for its help against an invasion of tribesmen from Pakistan.Kashmir profile - TimelineA war erupted and India asked the United Nations to intervene. The UN recommended holding a plebiscite to settle the question of whether the state would join India or Pakistan. However, the two countries could not agree to a deal to demilitarise the region before the referendum could be held.In July 1949, India and Pakistan signed an agreement to establish a ceasefire line as recommended by the UN and the region became divided.AFPKashmir is known by some as India\\'s Switzerland, due to its verdant fields and sweeping mountainscapesA second war followed in 1965. Then in 1999, India fought a brief but bitter conflict with Pakistani-backed forces.By that time, India and Pakistan were declared nuclear powers. Today, Delhi and Islamabad both claim Kashmir in full, but control only parts of it.Why has there been so much unrest in the Indian-administered part?Within Indian-administered Kashmir, opinions about the territory\\'s rightful allegiance are diverse and strongly held.

Google's iOS app has a new solution if you come across a scientific paper or an article written by someone a little too fond of being obtuse. The new Simplify feature for Google's mobile app rewrites any jargon-filled internet text into language that doesn't require a specialty dictionary, and without leaving the app.To use Simplify, you'll need to browse the web from the Google app. When you hit a wall of needlessly complicated text, you can highlight it, and a little Simplify button will appear. Tapping the button will rework that highlighted paragraph into something far more comprehensible to the average person.Simplify is essentially a shortcut for Google's Gemini AI. Google Research designed a prompt-optimization process that asks Gemini to transform the text into something easier to understand behind the scenes, activating when you tap the Simplify button.The Simplify button won't utterly change your life or redefine how you engage with content online, but it could cut down on the need for new tabs or at least remove the need to copy and paste opaque text into Gemini or ChatGPT every time you run up against a linguistic roadblock.Simple AIAccording to the developers of the Simplify tool, the AI translation not only made dense content easier to parse, but it also helped them remember what they read. It's of a piece with other AI tools rolled out by Google to streamline tedious or annoying bits of people's experiences online.It matches neatly with features like Google Gemini widgets or the anticipated Power Up button for improving your prompts. The Simplify feature also falls under the AI enhancement of the browsing experience that Google has deployed (with occasional pratfalls), like the Search Generative Experience and AI Overviews for Search. Simplify feels more directly pitched to individuals, though, since you have to choose to use it.For now, Simplify is iOS-only, and it's not going to be perfect every time. Like any AI tool, it might make a mistake or oversimplify its response and lose some of the nuance found in the original text. That's a tradeoff common to any translation, however. It may also be a tradeoff most users will be happy to make, especially when the alternative is drowning in multisyllabic nonsense about blockchain governance protocols.Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.You might also likeYou can put Google Gemini right on your smartphone home screen – here’s howOne of my favorite AI tools is getting an iPhone app, and here's why you should install itGoogle Gemini could soon get a super-useful 'Power up' button – here's what it does\\nEric Hal Schwartz is a freelance writer for TechRadar with more than 15 years of experience covering the intersection of the world and technology.

Legislation that won final approval Wednesday would halt the capital gains tax this year for individuals and could eventually eliminate it for corporations, if state revenues keep growing. The tax repeal now heads to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has said he\\'s “very supportive” of it. Though proponents hope it can spur the economy, detractors assert that the capital gains tax repeal will primarily benefit the rich and result in less tax revenue for public schools and services. The Republican-led Legislature overcame objections by Democrats only after expanding the bill with greater tax breaks for seniors and disabled residents and new sales tax exemptions for diapers and feminine hygiene products.Missouri\\'s unique income tax carve-out comes as Republican-led legislatures in at least eight other states have passed more traditional income tax rate reductions this year. It also comes as Congress weighs whether to renew and expand income tax breaks enacted during President Donald Trump\\'s first term in office.Capital gains are profits from the sale of assets such as stocks, cryptocurrency or property. The federal government taxes long-term capital gains, on assets held for more than a year, at a lower rate than ordinary income. All states that tax income also tax capital gains. Missouri currently is among 32 states and the District of Columbia that tax capital gains at the same rate as wages and other income, according to the nonprofit Tax Foundation. Eight states tax capital gains at a lower rate than other income. Some Democratic-led states have been moving in the opposite direction. Maryland lawmakers last month passed a bill that would impose a 2% capital gains tax on those with incomes over $350,000. And Washington lawmakers recently passed legislation to impose an extra 2.9% tax on capital gains over $1 million. Minnesota already imposes a surcharge on capital gains and other investment income over $1 million. Proponents of axing the capital gains tax say the tax discourages investment and incentivizes people to hold onto assets instead of selling them and spending money elsewhere in the economy. “When you tax something you get less of it,\" said Jonathan Williams, president and chief economist at the American Legislative Exchange Council, an association of conservative lawmakers and businesses. \"The idea is, of course, you want more investment in your state.”Though ALEC has long backed the repeal of state capital gains taxes, Missouri House Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins said the idea came to him last year from friends at an employee-owned construction company that was getting hit with the tax. He said his legislation also could benefit family farmers who want to sell their land. The capital gains tax results in \"lost economic opportunity, financial sclerosis, lower wages -- all of which serve to make Missouri less competitive both domestically and internationally,” said Republican state Sen. Curtis Trent, who handled the bill in the Senate. Opponents say the wealthy will get the greatest reward. Repealing Missouri\\'s tax on capital gains would set “a worrisome precedent” nationally and “worsen economic and racial inequities,” said Sam Waxman, deputy director of state policy research at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. One government study found that white families are more likely to report capital gains than some minorities. Among middle-income taxpayers, about 8% of white families benefited from the federal government\\'s tax rates on capital gains and dividends compared to just 3% of Black families and 1% of Hispanic families, according to a 2023 U.S. Treasury Department report. In Missouri, about 542,000 individual income taxpayers reported capital gains in 2022, amounting to just one-fifth of all filers, according to the Missouri Budget Project, a nonprofit research group that opposes the capital gains tax repeal. The group estimates that 80% of the tax relief would go to the wealthiest 5% of taxpayers.Legislative researchers estimate Missouri\\'s capital gains tax repeal could cost the state about $262 million annually when fully implemented. But that\\'s disputed by both supporters and opponents. The Missouri Budget Project estimates the cost could be nearly $600 million annually. Trent predicts the tax repeal will trigger “increased economic growth (that) will translate into increased tax revenue\" over time. Owen Zidar, an economics and public affairs professor at Princeton University, studied the impacts of 584 capital gains tax rate changes in states over four decades. Capital gains tax cuts tend to result in more people selling assets for gains, but not so much as to offset the lost tax revenue, he said. Zidar said he is skeptical of claims that Missouri\\'s capital gains tax repeal will attract a lot of investment and economic activity.“I think it’s going to be a substantial revenue decrease,” he said.', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Missouri poised to eliminate capital gains tax\\nENTITIES: Missouri, Mike Kehoe, Donald Trump, Jonathan Williams, Chad Perkins, Curtis Trent, Sam Waxman, Owen Zidar\\nEVENT: Missouri legislature approved a bill to halt capital gains tax for individuals and potentially corporations, awaiting governor's approval.

Moses is arguably the second-best halfback in the game behind Cleary and led NSW to a series win last year, but he did share the spoils with Luai, who has also enjoyed a strong start to 2025 at his new club. However, if Moses can star in a win over a talented Dolphins side to kick off Round 10, that would make NSW coach Laurie Daley’s decision much more easier.Moses’ club coach Jason Ryles didn’t want to comment on his halfback’s chances of being picked for the Blues. It’s fair enough, as the first year coach is trying to figure out how to turn the fortunes of the last-placed Eels around.“In my thought process is how we play every week here. Having experienced it myself, if you get your footy right here, then Origin looks after itself,” Ryles said.“First and foremost, we’ll get our footy right. If whoever does happen to get selected, then that’s a bonus.. “I think there’s enough pressure and commentary on the Origin stuff. I’ve been in it as a player and have watched on from the outside.“We’re aware of the influence Mitch has on our footy team.”Dolphins’ burning question: Can the Dolphins improve on their horror record outside of QLD?The Dolphins have had next to no success outside of their home state since entering the comp at the start of 2023, winning only three games outside of QLD.Coach Kristian Woolf admits he doesn’t have the silver bullet to fix it, but said that he has altered with the team’s preparation for the interstate games and hopefully that will yield results. “It’s been an issue for us over the first 2.5 years to be fair. I think we’ve only won three games outside of Queensland so it’s something we need to be a little bit better at,” Woolf said.“We’ve raised it previously with the group and it’s something we’ve tried to tinker with our preparation to accommodate it as well. “If I had the answer we’d have fixed it. It’s probably a number of things but as I said, we’ve made a couple of little adjustments and I’d like to think it will help us.”MORE NRL NEWSBLOG WITH HOOPS: Origin battle settled; unsung hero behind Moneyball riseTALKING POINTS: Madge’s Broncos make no sense; Origin bid verdict on ‘destroyer’‘FORTUNATE’: Ricky’s rare Bunker call after huge play rubbed out in golden point Mitchell and Humphreys return for Bunnie | 01:29FRIDAY MAY 9Newcastle Knights vs Gold Coast Titans at McDonald Jones Stadium, 6:00pm AESTKnights’ burning question: Can Newcastle prove last weekend’s offensive output was no fluke?Entering Magic Round, the Knights had averaged just 10 points a game, so 24 points in the first half against the Rabbitohs was not what anyone envisaged.Newcastle’s attack roared back to life on the Suncorp Stadium turf, with impressive young gun Fletcher Sharpe scoring a hat-trick and superstar fullback Kalyn Ponga returning to form. Not only was it the win the Knights needed to get their season back on track, but they finally showed how dangerous a team they can be when everything clicks in attack as they are already very stout defensively. One swallow doesn’t make a summer and it was against a decimated Souths side, but there were good signs that Adam O’Brien’s men can build on.Next up is a tantalising match up against the Gold Coast, who are the second-worst defensive team in the league. Titans’ burning question: Will the Titans overcome the Fifita distraction and finally put an end to a horror streak?It’s been 41 days since the Gold Coast Titans have last tasted victory. That was March 28 when they upset the Roosters in Sydney. At that point of the season, the Titans were sitting pretty in the top eight after two convincing wins. That seems like an age ago now. Since, the Titans have lost five straight games and are now on the verge of losing one of their best players in David Fifita. Fifita was dropped for Magic Round due to a disagreement with coach Des Hasler and has now been shut down indefinitely amid reports he’s been shopped around to rival clubs. Having Fifita in the line up no doubt makes this team better, but it’s fair to say his form has been hot-and-cold at best in 2025. The thing is, the Titans have so much talent across the park and simply should not be in the midst of a five-game losing streak whether Fifita is on the park or not. What might be of some relief and give this playing group some much-needed confidence is an upcoming date with the Knights. The Titans match up well against the Knights, having thrashed them earlier in the season (without Fifita).

Remarkably, they’re 4-1 when Humphreys is wearing the No. 7.It’ll be no easy task against a Broncos side that will be hungry off a heavy loss, but with Humphreys back on deck, at least Souths are settled at the most important position. Broncos’ burning question: Can the Broncos find consistency as Ezra Mam return looms?The Broncos’ Jekyll and Hyde season continued with a confounding 32-8 loss to the last placed Panthers a week after thrashing the top of the table Bulldogs. Michael Maguire’s side can’t seem to string strong performances together and have lost three of their last four and they could be set for more growing pains with Ezra Mam returning in the next couple of weeks. Johns believes the Broncos looked tired in their Magic Round loss to the Panthers. “The Broncos were such a strange game to watch because at the start they poured so much energy into their defence and they were all over the Panthers,” Johns said on Matty and Cronk. “I tell you what was unusual about the Broncos was they fatigued really quickly. They coughed up a lot of ball and made a lot of errors, but I thought halfway through the first half, I thought some of the forwards are starting to struggle here.“The last 20 minutes of the game, the forwards were so out on their foot that Penrith could just do whatever they wanted.” Cooper Cronk believes the Broncos need to get their defence right on their edges. “Defensively we saw some poor decisions when Cleary was playing straight, Kotoni Staggs was just getting caught out of position,” Cronk said. While Mam was predicted to return at five-eighth, with Hunt switching to hooker, Johns believes he should come back via the bench. “I think when he comes in at No.14 he will give Madge a lot of mid-game flexibility,” Johns said of Mam.“Put him at No.14 then you can move him to No.6 and put Hunt to No.9.” Cronk believes Mam’s return could bring the best out of Hunt, who has struggled for consistency this season like the team. “I think you might get a reaction out of Ben Hunt as well, if he sees that Ezra is there, his level of performance will go through the roof,” Cronk said. Ben Hunt could be moved amid Ezra Mam’s looming return.Source: Getty ImagesSATURDAY MAY 10Canberra Raiders vs Canterbury Bulldogs at GIO Stadium, 3.00pm AESTRaiders’ burning question: Are the Raiders losing their most important player in title charge?The Raiders have stunned the NRL this season and can go equal top of the table with a win over the ladder leading Bulldogs in Round 10. But could their title window open and close in the same season with their halfback Jamal Fogarty moving to the Sea Eagles next season? Johns believes the Ricky Stuart is in the midst of his finest hour as an NRL coach. “I think this year is just about his finest coaching performance,” Johns said. However, Cronk believes the key to the success of the team might be the play of Fogarty, who will leave at season’s end. “What I love about what Ricky and the Raiders are doing is they have this strong, experienced forward pack that have been doing these things for the last couple of years with Tapine, Papalii and Horsburgh has gone to another level this year,” Cronk said. “But these young outside backs have really taken their game to another level and I think the key to it and I know he’s leaving is Jamal Fogarty’s kicking game and decision making. “He doesn’t over play his hand ever, but he keeps that team on track. It is good halfback play for an older guy who probably doesn’t have the speed and the footwork to break open a line, like Metcalf or Cleary, but he is doing a lot of work behind the scenes to keep that operation humming.” Johns agreed that Fogarty has had an effect at the Raiders like Adam Reynolds at the Broncos, which makes the Titans decision to move him on all the more confounding. “Fogarty binds everything together,” Johns said. “It is a bit like Adam Reynolds before he arrived at the Broncos they had all this talent, but had no one to bind it all together.” Jamal Fogarty holds the key to the Raiders’ stunning season.Source: Getty ImagesBulldogs’ burning question: Can the Bulldogs compete with the Raiders’ forward pack?The Bulldogs bounced back into form with a 38-18 win over the Titans off the back of their loss to the Broncos. However, their only loss this season came against a big powerful forward pack and they will again face just that in a top of the table clash with the Raiders in Round 10. Johns believes the loss of Jacob Preston to a four-game suspension after his failed judiciary challenge could be a massive factor against the Raiders. “They are missing some key men and they are losing Jacob Preston for this week,” Johns said. “Their attack has been the best, but Ciraldo would be disappointed by conceding 18 points against an understrength Titans team.” Cronk believes the Bulldogs face a huge challenge to handle the Raiders’ front row and their backline defence led by Stephen Crichton will face one of their biggest tests against Canberra. “I think the Bulldogs defence through the middle needs to stop Tapine and Papalii,” Cronk said. “Starling has been very good off the back of those guys’ momentum. But Crichton is the best defensive centre in the game.” Roosters open door for early Young exit | 00:33St George Illawarra Dragons vs New Zealand Warriors at WIN Stadium, 5:30pm AESTDragons’ burning question: How much of an impact will exciting young gun Loko Jnr Pasifiki Tonga have on debut?The Dragons will unleash the 19-year-old forward at WIN Stadium on Saturday, hoping he can provide a spark for the Red V, who have lost two straight games. It’s been an up-and-down year for the Dragons, who entered this season with concerns over their forward pack.While the likes of Toby Couchman and Jaydn Su’A have played well, there hasn’t been enough input consistently from the rest of the forwards.Pasifiki Tonga isn’t going to be expected to be the answer on debut, but Shane Flanagan hopes he can add some much needed punch.Last week against the Tigers, only one Dragons forward ran for over 100 metres (Su’A).Against a talented Warriors pack, that output won’t do. Pasifiki Tonga is looking forward to the challenge NRL footy brings, and he’s not overthinking things ahead of his maiden first grade match.“I just want to play my game, stay in the moment, stay calm,” he told the SMH.“My footy is simple – just run hard and everything will fall into place. We have a saying that [teammate] Ben Murdoch-Masila says – just run hard, tackle hard.“That’s what I try to do.”Warriors’ burning question: Can Luke Metcalf make the Warriors a threat for a maiden title?The Warriors weren’t picked by many experts to make the top eight, but they are entrenched in the top four and a smoky for a drought-breaking maiden title. Granted the Warriors have had a slightly softer draw to start the year, but you can only beat who is in front of you and Metcalf has his team singing from the same hymn sheet. Johns marvelled at Metcalf’s ability to talk the talk and then walk the walk in his bid to replace club legend Shaun Johnson in the No.7 jersey. “Metcalf geez he is playing good football,” Johns said. “What he is doing at the moment you can’t underestimate how difficult it is because he is organising the side, he is owning the side and he is running the side. “But he’s not losing that individuality that made him such a good player.“He went to Andrew Webster in the off-season and said, I want to run this team.” Cronk believes Metcalf has built his game on his defence and managing his teammates and his running game and brilliance in attack is just feeding off that foundation. “For a guy after nine rounds and with the inexperience of the No.7 jersey, he has got the Warriors in the palm of his hand and I’m not just talking the team, but the fans and everything going with him,” Cronk said. “As a young half when you are trying to put your fingerprints on a football team, there is probably two ways you need to do it. “One is your defence. You have got to gain the respect of your teammates in defence. And the other one is communication and leading the team around the field and he is doing both of them. “And we haven’t even spoken about his skill and running and passing game. They are the things that a half gains respect from the rest of the team.” North Queensland Cowboys vs Penrith Panthers at Queensland Country Bank Stadium, 7:35pm AESTCowboys’ burning question: Can the Cowboys arrest the trend of poor starts in games?Having won four and lost four, the Cowboys sit just outside of the eight.A solid effort with a third of the season in the books, no doubt. But it really could look much better if they had helped themselves early in the contest. In Magic Round, the Cowboys trailed 28-12 to the Warriors before leaving it too late in a 30-26 loss.In fact, in six of eight games this season, the Cowboys have trailed at half time. Remarkably, in all eight games, North Queensland have been trailing after 25 minutes.Fullback Scott Drinkwater thinks he knows why the Cowboys are slow to move and hopes they’ll be able to rectify it this week against the team who has won the past four titles.“I just think when we don’t have momentum at the start of the game or lose momentum, we’re giving away cheap possession with a few penalties or six agains and that’s leading to tries too easily,” Drinkwater said.“I think we just need a bit more grit and fight when we we don’t have momentum at the start of the game so we can hang in there.“Once we start going after the game, I feel like we can get on top of teams pretty easily and quickly and we’ve shown that but maybe we need a bit more fight when we don’t have momentum.”Panthers’ burning question: Can Cleary do the unthinkable and lead the Panthers back to the finals?After being in dead last after eight rounds, many were prepared to write the Panthers finals chances off, but a stunning 32-8 win over the Broncos has them just two wins outside the top eight. Nathan Cleary was mesmerising against Brisbane and Johns believes the key to his game was playing straight and creating opportunities and space for his outside men. “I’ve rarely seen him play so straight, there was a marked change in his football and it just worked so well,” Johns said. “He just kept peeling the Broncos short, particularly on the left-hand side and made a big difference to their attack.“It gave Blaize that little bit more room and it allowed them to simplify their football.” Cronk believes the key to unlocking the Panthers attack is Cleary playing straight through the middle, before shifting the ball to his fast men out wide. “When we talk about playing North-South, the whole idea of that is the more direct you can play in the middle of the field, is the centre metre or the metre that the outside players need,” Cronk said. “I always talk about, if you think you are playing square, you are actually not square enough, so over-exaggerate that squareness on game day actually sets you a straighter compass. “He was gun barrel straight and down the left side it was the difference between scoring tries and not.” Will DCE halt Roosters development? | 04:17SUNDAY MAY 11Melbourne Storm vs Wests Tigers at AAMI Park, 2:00pm AESTStorm’ burning question: Can the Storm fill the void left by Harry Grant?The Storm looked like they were cruising to a title this season before an injury to their captain Harry Grant threw their revenge season off the rails. The Storm have now lost two of their last three and are in danger of slipping out of the top four against the in form Tigers. Johns believes the importance of Grant to the Storm machine can’t be over-estimated. “About a month ago we were saying it was the Storm’s competition, but in the absence of Harry Grant we are seeing how critical he is to that side,” Johns said. “He is vital to that fast middle field football they like to play. The last three weeks without Harry there they have dropped considerably.”Cronk explained how the absence of Grant allows defences to focus their pressure on the Storm halves, which cuts down their space and makes Melbourne more predictable in attack. “Defences when they are not coming up against Harry just put their eyes on Munster and Hughes, so they don’t have too much of a concern around the middle of the ruck,” Cronk said. “They will make their tackles, but as soon as that pass goes out, they push to put pressure on Munster and Hughes.“When the defence takes their eyes off Munster and Hughes, the one person that takes advantage of that is Grant. They pass, pass, pass wide and then there will be Grant and Papenhuyzen back through the middle at some stage.“So there is a real opportunity to play both with width and straighten up, but when Grant’s not there they struggle to straighten up.”Tigers’ burning question: Can Galvin and Luai put issues aside to lead the Tigers back to the finals?After three straight wooden spoons, the Tigers are now back in the top eight and have won three of their last four games despite the Lachlan Galvin saga threatening to derail their season. While Galvin might not be a part of the club’s future beyond 2026 and he is reportedly not tight with Tigers skipper Jarome Luai off the field, that doesn’t mean the pair can’t make it work on it. Johns believes Luai summed it up after the Tigers’ 34-28 win over the Dragons. “Galvin and Luai are forming a really good combination and Luai came out after the game and said, you don’t have to be great mates to win,” Johns said. Cronk agreed with Luai, but challenged the Tigers playmakers to keep building their partnership on the field because he believes it holds the key to the Tigers playing finals or not. “To Luai’s point, Benji is in this position where he is coming off three wooden spoons and there are signs of improvement with the Tigers,” Cronk said. “So to Luai’s point they have to play together because if you don’t you are probably going to lose a few more games than you probably would win.“The whole idea for the Tigers and Benji is improvement, so I don’t mind that Luai said that. They need to gel and perform well. They need to find a way to work together, but ultimately it is all about performance.“If you play well no one is going to ask questions, but if you lose games and there is frustration that comes into play I guarantee there will be questions asked.”Tigers take out try-fest against Dragons | 02:28Manly Sea Eagles vs Cronulla Sharks at 4 Pines Park, 4:05pmSea Eagles’ burning question: Can the Sea Eagles finally pick up a big scalp?So far this season, Manly are travelling along ok without being too flash hot.Inconsistency is an issue, with Anthony Seibold’s men unable to string together some good form for more than a couple of weeks. On paper, they are a team that should be battling for a top four spot, but at the moment, they are stuck in mediocrity. What might help them get out of that is a win against a genuine top eight team.In 2025, the Sea Eagles have only beaten one team currently sitting in the eight (Raiders). They’ll have a chance against the Sharks to pick up their second top eight scalp, otherwise they risk falling out of the eight. Like Manly, the Sharks have been hot and cold, so it’s a very winnable game. However, it’s hard to put too much confidence in the Sea Eagles at the minute.The Daly Cherry-Evans bombshell has been a distraction no doubt, but it would be extremely disappointing if Manly were on the outside looking in approaching the midway point of the season. Sharks’ burning question: Has Nicho Hynes found his mojo and can he back it up against DCE and the Sea Eagles?Nicho Hynes faced a huge test in coming up against Mitchell Moses last weekend and he passed it with flying colours to lead the Sharks to a 28-18 win. Hynes produced three try assists and 64 run metres in his best game of the season and now the challenge is to back that up against a resurgent Manly side. The Sharks could find themselves in the top four with a win over the Sea Eagles and the Hynes holds the key to their success. Johns believes Hynes’ running game is the key to unlocking his playmaking. “I thought William Kennedy was really good, but importantly for the Sharks Nicho Hynes had about four try assists on the weekend,” Johns said. “He’s starting to get that directness back. He is getting to that target defender and they look much better.” Cronk praised Sharks coach Craig Fitzgibbon for backing Hynes and giving him the confidence to run the side his way. “He was a little bit like Cleary in that he was way more North-South than East-West,” Cronk said. “He had some nice touches and I really like what Craig Fitzgibbon said about Nicho. He stood up for his halfback. “Yes he gets attention good and bad at different stages, but for Hynes’ development, Fitzgibbon is absolutely the right coach for him. “I think he knows what hard work looks like. He stood up for him and he will support Nicho when he needs to. “If I was helping out with Nicho I would say, go back and watch some of your good touches on the weekend and realise when he does something well his first movement was forward not sideways.” Nicho Hynes was on fire against the Eels.Source: Getty ImagesBye: Sydney Roosters\", 'location': 'N/A', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: NRL Round 10 preview: Burning questions\\nENTITIES: Mitch Moses, Dolphins, Knights, Titans, Rabbitohs, Broncos, Raiders, Bulldogs, Dragons, Warriors, Cowboys, Panthers, Storm, Tigers, Sea Eagles, Sharks\\nEVENT: Previews of each NRL game in Round 10, highlighting key questions for each team, including player form, injury impacts, and strategic challenges.\\nCONTEXT: Preview of NRL Round 10 with burning questions.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 48281, 'sourceId': 926, 'url': 'https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/washington-governor-signs-rent-control-bill-law-121576799', 'title': 'Washington governor signs rent-control bill into law', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T22:32:08.000Z', 'content': \"Washington state Gov. Bob Ferguson has signed a bill into law that sets limits on rent increasesByMARTHA BELLISLE Associated PressMay 7, 2025, 5:20 PMWashington state Gov. Bob Ferguson signed a bill into law Wednesday that sets limits on rent increases, making the state among the first in the nation to provide protections for tenants.The rent stabilization measure, House Bill 1217, adds Washington to states like Oregon and California that have sought new ways to curb homelessness. Bill sponsor Sen. Emily Alvarado, a West Seattle Democrat, said the measure sets common-sense guardrails on the state’s rental-housing market “so that hardworking families and older adults don’t get unchecked excessive rent increases.”“Housing is not a luxury. It’s a basic human need,” Alvarado said at the bill signing. “And everyone in this state deserves a stable and affordable home.”The measure caps rent increases at 7% plus inflation or 10% — whichever is lower. The restrictions include single-family homes. The rent-increase cap for manufactured homes is 5%. Lawmakers approved the plan on a 54-44 vote, with five Democrats joining the Republican opposition. Ferguson praised Alvarado and the many advocates across the state who worked hard to get the bill passed. It almost didn't make it. It successfully moved through both houses, but two amendments added on the Senate floor sent it into a conference committee. Those amendments increased the cap from 7% to 10% plus inflation and exempted single-family homes. Opponents of the bill argued that developers would leave the state if it became law and said similar policies in Oregon and California added to those states’ financial burdens instead of slowing the homeless crisis.Oregon's rent-control bill was passed in 2019 and later updated to cap rent increases at either 7% plus the annual 12-month average change in the consumer price index for the U.S. West, or 10% — whichever is lower.The conference committee got the cap down to 7% plus inflation or 10% — whichever is lower, and restored protections for the 38% of renters who live in single-family homes. With Ferguson's signature, it's now law.“This law is a good beginning. It’s long overdue and it’s urgently needed,” Alvarado said. “Forty percent of the people in the state of Washington are renters or manufactured homeowners and before today they had no protections over how high the rent can go, leading to pain and to devastating destabilization of families and communities.”Ferguson also signed nine other bills to help homeowners and renters. He said when he campaigned for governor, affordable housing was the top issue voters raised, so he supports bills to help make it easier to secure housing.“Let’s make this the session of affordable housing,” he said before signing the first measure. The other measures included limits on certain provisions in rental agreements, notices for mobile home communities, and property tax relief for disabled veterans.\", 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Washington enacts rent control with new law\\nENTITIES: Bob Ferguson, Emily Alvarado, Washington State Legislature\\nEVENT: Washington state Gov.

Starmer agreed a three-year compromise in the deal unveiled on Tuesday.“The Tories offered us two years but we said it wasn’t enough,” the Indian official said. “They put it on the table. We wanted more than three, but the principle had already been conceded in return for some gives on our sides on services.”Indian officials say the trade deal was “95 per cent done” while Badenoch was business secretary in Rishi Sunak’s government, but negotiations were paused because of elections in both countries.Badenoch has strongly criticised the national insurance element of the trade deal. “This is two-tier taxes from two-tier Keir,” she tweeted, adding that she refused to sign the deal.Badenoch’s spokesperson denied the Indian account of the NI negotiations, saying: “The Indians put it on the table and Kemi said No. Hence why we didn’t sign the deal.”The Tory leader said on X: “This is total and utter rubbish. I never agreed to any such tax deal. The evidence couldn’t be clearer — I refused to sign the deal. As I have always said, no deal is better than a bad deal.”India pushed hard during the three-year negotiations for the “Double Contribution Convention”, which will give Indian employers in the UK relief from Britain’s 15 per cent national insurance levy paid by companies.\\xa0The deal to avoid double taxation also covers NI contributions paid by employees, with New Delhi estimating it will cut costs for companies employing Indian workers posted to the UK by about 20 per cent.Starmer said the double taxation deal was part of agreements Britain already had with 50 other countries and that the criticism was “incoherent nonsense”. He challenged Badenoch to say whether she would rip them up.The prime minister told MPs: “The deal with India is a huge win for working people in this country.” He added: “It’s the biggest trade deal the UK has delivered since we left the EU.”Badenoch did not raise the India trade deal at Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday, with a number of senior Conservatives publicly endorsing the outcome of the discussions.Following Prime Minister’s Questions, Badenoch’s spokesperson called on the government to quickly publish a full impact assessment on both the cost of the double taxation agreement to the UK exchequer and the likely change in the number of Indian workers coming to the UK.“There needs to be a full assessment of how much this will cost and how many people this will lead to,” Badenoch’s spokesman said.Earlier, Sir Oliver Dowden, former Tory deputy prime minister, welcomed the deal, writing on X that it “builds on significant progress made by the previous Conservative government”.Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Brexiter former business secretary, said on X: “Cheaper food and drink including rice and tea, footwear and clothing thanks to a welcome trade deal with India.

Running as of April 2025, the new clock is pending approval before it joins roughly 450 other clocks worldwide in defining Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), the global system for measuring the ultraprecise beat of a second.Time signals are \"used literally billions of times each day for everything from setting clocks and watches to ensuring the accurate time stamping of hundreds of billions of dollars of electronic financial transactions,\" Liz Donley, chief of the Time and Frequency Division at NIST, said in a statement. (Donley is not credited as one of the new paper\\'s authors).The growing need for more precise timekeeping means that scientists are always working to develop better reference clocks — ones that define the time others are set by. Unlike their everyday counterparts, these reference devices are atomic clocks, deriving their ticks from the vibrations of atoms.Related: \\'A dream come true\\': Nuclear clock breakthrough could revolutionize study of the universe\\'s fundamental forcesNIST-F4 is a type of atomic clock known as a fountain clock, containing a cloud of thousands cesium atoms cooled to near absolute zero using lasers. The atoms are then thrown upwards under the impulse provided by a pair of laser beams, then fall under their own weight while passing through a microwave beam tuned to make the atoms oscillate.Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Counting this frequency (which occurs 9,192,631,770 times every second) enables scientists to precisely define the international second.NIST scientists Greg Hoth (left) and Vladislav Gerginov work on NIST-F4, NIST’s new cesium fountain clock, one of the most precise atomic clocks ever created. (Image credit: R. Eskalis/NIST)But that\\'s the relatively simple part. To ensure NIST-F4\\'s reliability, the scientists had to account for every source of miniscule noise that could affect the cesium atoms\\' vibrations. These include quantum cross-talk with other atoms; microwave leakage and lensing effects; and subtle distortions in the electromagnetic fields generated by the lasers.The team began making these tweaks in 2020, four years after the agency\\'s first fountain clock, NIST-F1, was decommissioned for restoration. This work included rebuilding the microwave cavity at the core of the clock from scratch.\"Evaluating a fountain clock like NIST-F4 is a slow process,\" first study author Vladislav Gerginov, a physicist at NIST who worked on the new design, said in the statement. \"We have to be very conservative. We should know everything about it.\"RELATED STORIESThe result is a clock with a total a total systematic uncertainty of 2.2×10⁻¹⁶ — a precision that means it loses less than a second every 140 million years. This extremely subtle lag is the product of noise from the randomness inherent in quantum measurements, a factor the scientists say could be reduced with better oscillators and refined laser cooling.NIST-F4 will tick alongside its precursor clock NIST-F3. The newer clock will operate around 90% of the time, and at least one of the clocks will run at any given time.

Though neither wants full-blown conflict, the dispute over Kashmir has produced three wars and multiple crises over eight decades. When two nuclear-armed neighbours clash, we should worry.One reason is that errors and misjudgments are always possible. Following its overnight strikes on Pakistan, which it accuses of involvement in the massacre of Hindu tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir last month, India said that it hit only terrorist infrastructure and that its actions were “not escalatory”. This is not a judgment that can be made unilaterally. Pakistan said India was “igniting an inferno” and that its military is authorised to take corresponding actions.The second cause for concern is the shifting context of the hostility. In India, Narendra Modi’s success is built on his identity as a Hindu nationalist strongman. He is also under intense pressure because he had declared unequivocally that Kashmir had returned to normalcy and would be not only “terror-free but [also] a heaven for tourists”.In Pakistan, where the military pulls the strings, the parlous state of the economy is only one cause of the generals’ unpopularity. Last month, the army chief, Asim Munir, stirred controversy by calling Kashmir Pakistan’s “jugular vein” – a loaded phrase echoing the description of its founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. That rhetoric angered India even before the Kashmir attack that came five days later.The massacre was claimed by the Resistance Front, regarded by India as a proxy of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba. Islamabad denies any link, but the military’s connections with militant groups are opaque. India is becoming increasingly blunt about attributing blame.In the past, the US has pushed the two sides to de-escalate. But the Trump administration has little attention to spare and less diplomatic capacity. It does not have an ambassador in New Delhi. Its relations with Pakistan are at a low. Europe is preoccupied by Ukraine, security and US tariffs. Beijing should press Pakistan to keep a cool head.Pakistan’s response to the strikes may soon be clearer. In the last crisis, in 2019, the two sides quietly stepped back from the brink. India can say it has struck; Pakistan says that it downed Indian jets (Indian officials have reportedly confirmed losing aircraft). Such an outcome would be a relief for civilians along the line of control – the de facto border – who are once more paying for decisions made far away as heavy artillery fire continues. But it might be only a temporary reprieve, and not for all. India’s announcement that it was suspending the Indus waters treaty – which might ultimately allow it to turn off the tap – is less dramatic than firing missiles, but could prove devastating for farmers in Pakistan.Last year, Mr Modi promised to restore the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, which his government wrongly demoted to centrally administered territories six years ago. He should do so. That decision, and the lockdown that followed, have fuelled anger and militancy. Pressure should be maintained on the Pakistani military over its dangerous accommodation of militants.The scholar Sumit Ganguly notes in his book Deadly Impasse that the two nations have often shown striking strategic restraint, but also that the dispute remains “remarkably durable”. It would be complacent to count on calibration.\\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The government has also asked the water CEOs to do more to avert water shortages, and the EA said hosepipe bans are on the horizon if a significant amount of rain does not fall.Members of the National Drought Group, who met on Wednesday to discuss their plans, told the Guardian that there is “no slack” in the system, that water companies are “woefully underprepared” for drought and the plan for many is “simply praying for rain”.It has been the driest start to spring in 69 years. England saw its driest March since 1961 and in April the country received just half its normal rainfall. Farmers have had to start irrigating crops earlier, and reservoir levels are either notably or exceptionally low across thenorth-east and north-west of England.According to the National Farmers’ Union (NFU) some crops are already failing, and significant rainfall in early May will be essential to avoid significant yield penalties and further losses. Livestock yields could also be at risk; grazing is not yet short, but farmers point out that fields will need a decent amount of rain to get animals through the summer.NFU deputy president, David Exwood, said: “The dry conditions and lack of any substantial rainfall has meant farmers in some parts of the country have started to irrigate crops much earlier than normal. The extreme weather patterns we have experienced over the past few years are impacting our ability to feed the nation.”The last time the UK was hit with a bad drought was 2022, when crops failed and London and the south-east almost ran out of water and were weeks from going into emergency measures. There were also hosepipe bans across the country. Experts at the NDG said the conditions this year are similar to those in 2022.Reservoir levels are lower than they were this time in 2022, however. Reservoir storage across England is 84% of total capacity, compared to 90% at the end of April in 2022. The NDG heard that a number of reservoirs in the north are well below what they should be for this time of year, and that northern water companies are upping their activities around fixing leaks ahead of summer. They are already looking at extracting from rivers, months before they would generally need to, and river flows are exceptionally low at present. The NDG heard that there have been mass fish deaths above what would be expected for this time of year.“There’s no resilience in the system,” said a NDG source, adding: “All the Environment Agency and water companies kept saying was, ‘we hope it’s going to rain’.”Stuart Singleton-White, head of campaigns at the Angling Trust, said: “If the summer remains as dry as this spring, the driest spring since the infamous year of 1976, then we’re all going to pay the price for the complacency that has been the hallmark of the way water companies have managed our water. No new reservoirs since privatisation, alarming rates of leakage, and lack of preparation for the impacts of climate change.“With fish kills already at a high level and many rivers at a low level for the time of year, it could turn out to be a challenging summer of drought and devastation for our rivers and fish.

It was triggered in part by an incident on April 28, when air traffic controllers for the airport experienced a radar and communications blackout. They were unable to reach approaching planes. There were no accidents, and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy later told reporters that the outage lasted for 30 seconds. After that incident, several air traffic controllers took time off to deal with the stress and trauma. That, on top of bad weather, a runway that\\'s closed for repair and an already short-staffed air traffic controller corps, led to a lot of disruption.\\nDavid Grizzle, the former chief operating officer and head of air traffic control for the Federal Aviation Administration, says what happened at Newark isn\\'t surprising, given decades-old staffing and technology issues.

Kim, who described something of a Fred Funk emanating from the toilets at last month's RBC Heritage event on Hilton Head Island.'There are player/caddie only porta potties near tee boxes,' Kim wrote on X. 'One caddie went to use one on Thursday morning and in the corner of the porta potty, sees a pair of boxer briefs with some [poop emoji].'They tried to find out who it was but couldn't figure it out,' he added.There was one suspect, but as Kim explained, that individual has since been exonerated.'The briefs were a brand that had a brand ambassador but it was proven that it wasn't him lol,' Kim wrote. Kim lines up a put at the RBC Heritage, where one golfer or caddy had a bathroom incident The inside dirt was shared online by PGA's Michael S. Kim, who described something of a Fred Funk emanating from the toilets at last month's RBC Heritage event on Hilton Head Island Fan reactions ranged from the humorous ('thank stinks') to the constructive.'Mike,' one wrote in response. 'Not sure who is running lead on the investigation but I'd like to recommend looking to see if anyone withdrew during or after Thursdays (sic) round citing an illness.'Alas, nobody withdrew from the event, which was won by Justin Thomas at -17 for the tournament.This is hardly the sport's first high-profile bathroom incident.Ireland's Padraig Harrington made a mid-round sprint for a porta potty during a 2023 Champions Tour event at PGA Frisco – something he blamed on his advancing age.'I went in the toilet,' said Harrington, who was 51 at the time. 'The door was locked. Took me a few minutes to realize there wasn't somebody in there, another while to get the door open.'As we are on the Champions Tour, I had the longest pee ever. And then I kind of rushed down the fairway and hit my shot.' The incident described by Kim played out at the recent RBC Heritage in South Carolina Unfortunately for Harrington, that approach shot landed in the penalty area. He would finish the hole with a double-bogey 6.'So, when you get over 50, it sometimes takes a long time to have a pee,' Harrington said. 'That's my excuse. That's got to be original, I would assume.'There was another incident at this year's Masters, where Spanish amateur Jose Luis Ballester urinated into Rae's Creek at the 13th. The situation nearly resulted in a punishment for the 21-year-old, who claimed to have forgotten about the bathrooms located nearby.'I completely forgot that we had those restrooms to the left of the tee box,' an unrepentant Ballester explained after he was caught in the act. 'I really needed to pee. I didn't really know where to go…I'm like, I'm just going to sneak here in the river and probably people would not see me that much, and then they clapped for me.'He has since apologized to Augusta National and told reporters that he hopes to 'just move on from this moment.'\", 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: PGA Golfer Reveals Disgusting Porta Potty Mishap\\nENTITIES: Michael S.

But Judge Steven Hippler wrote that Kohberger's Sixth Amendment right to a public trial also entitles him to have his parents and siblings present if they want to attend.“Courts recognize that having defendant’s family members present at trial advances the values served by the right to public trial, i.e., ensuring fair proceedings; reminding the prosecutor and judge of their grave responsibilities; discouraging perjury; and encouraging witnesses to come forward,” Hippler wrote.Kohberger, 30, a former graduate student in criminal justice at nearby Washington State University, is charged in the stabbing deaths of Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves at a rental home near campus in Moscow, Idaho, on Nov. 13, 2022.Prosecutors have said they intended to seek the death penalty if Kohberger is convicted at his trial, which is set to begin in August.Hippler said the court must balance Kohberger's right to a public trial with the state's interest in obtaining forthright testimony from witnesses. But, he added, there is little risk of Kohberger's family members shaping what they might say from the witness stand in response to what they observe at the trial: The scope of their proposed testimony is narrow, and they have previously given recorded interviews that will help guard against them altering what they say.Hippler previously ruled that family members of the victims may attend the trial.\", 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Kohberger's family can attend murder trial\\nENTITIES: Bryan Kohberger, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen, Kaylee Goncalves, Steven Hippler\\nEVENT: Judge allows Kohberger's family to attend trial despite potential testimony, balancing public trial rights with witness integrity.\\nCONTEXT: Judge balances defendant's rights with witness testimony integrity.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 47014, 'sourceId': 888, 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/07/world/pope-conclave-updates/a-top-cardinal-asks-for-divine-guidance-at-a-difficult-moment-in-history', 'title': 'No Pope Elected in Conclave’s First Vote', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T15:12:54.000Z', 'content': 'PinnedHere’s the latest.Black smoke puffed from a chimney above the Sistine Chapel on Wednesday night, signaling that 133 cardinals sequestered inside had not reached a decision in a first round of voting for a new pope to lead the world’s 1.4 billion Roman Catholics.The initial vote had not been expected to yield a pontiff. The cardinals, the most ever to gather in a papal conclave, will retire to guest quarters at the Vatican and return on Thursday morning to continue voting. They will remain isolated during their deliberations, without phone or internet access and under oaths of total secrecy, until a two-thirds majority agrees on a candidate.The first conclave in more than a decade, a little more than two weeks after Pope Francis’ death set in motion the process of choosing his successor, comes during an uncertain time for the church, which is facing difficult decisions about its future direction, strained finances and a reckoning over past sexual abuse scandals.After a morning Mass, the conclave began as the cardinals, all men and nearly all over age 50, filed in a solemn procession into the Sistine Chapel, where they took assigned seats at long wooden tables under the soaring frescoes of Renaissance masters.The papal election is one of the world’s oldest dramas, but this one is unlike any before it, with many cardinals appointed by Francis meeting one another for the first time. The new faces bring unfamiliar politics, priorities and concerns that some experts say could make the selection process more fragmented than usual. Francis also left the church deeply divided, with progressive factions pushing for more inclusion and change and conservatives seeking to roll things back, often under the guise of preserving unity.Here’s what to know:How it works: The cardinals will participate in four rounds of voting every day until a candidate achieves a two-thirds majority. The ballots are burned after two rounds of voting, and the smoke above the Sistine Chapel signals whether a decision has been made — black smoke for no decision, white if there is a pope. There is no indication of how long it will take, though the last two conclaves reached decisions within two days.Possible successors: Predicting the outcome of a papal election is always challenging, but oddsmakers say that two top contenders are Cardinal Pietro Parolin of Italy, who was Francis’ second-in-command, and Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of the Philippines, a country where the church is growing rapidly.Referendum on Francis: The election in many ways will turn on whether the cardinals want a pope who will follow Francis’ path of openness and inclusion or forge a different one. During his 12-year pontificate, Francis made global headlines for landmark declarations that encouraged liberals, including allowing the blessing of people in same-sex unions and raising his voice for migrants.Test your knowledge: How well do you know the process of selecting a pope?

All 133 voting cardinals must write the name of the man he sees as pope on a rectangular piece of paper under the phrase “Eligo in Summum Pontificem,” or “I elect as the supreme pontiff.” Cardinals individually walk their ballots to the chapel’s altar, where they say an oath in Latin, and leave the ballot on a plate.Votes are counted before being read aloud and pierced and tied together with a red string (the “Conclave” film depicted this practice). After ballots are counted, they are burned.Smoke emerges from the Sistine Chapel up to twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Black smoke tells the world that the cardinals haven’t reached a decision; white smoke announces that a new pope has been chosen.Both of the past two popes — Benedict XVI in 2005 and Francis in 2013 — were elected in two days. For the past two centuries, each pope was selected within four days or fewer.The cardinal electors will take Sunday off for prayer if a pope has not been selected by Saturday afternoon.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMay 7, 2025, 4:24 p.m. ETMay 7, 2025Paper ballots and sacred oaths: the objects guiding the conclave.From left, wooden balls with numbers corresponding to each cardinal elector; papal vestments that the new pope will don; and the doors of the Apostolic Palace, which are closed with the Pontifical Swiss Guard seal.The conclave to elect the next pope is now underway at the Vatican. The cardinals — the prelates who are just below the pope in the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy — will vote by secret ballot for a successor to Pope Francis until one candidate earns a two-thirds majority.While we may not know what’s being said during the conclave — it is off limits to outsiders — we do have a pretty good idea what it will look like. During the gathering, the cardinals will follow specific instructions and use several distinctive objects to facilitate the process, many steeped in tradition.Here’s a look at some of those objects, and the meaning behind them.Voting InstrumentsWhen the cardinals vote in the Sistine Chapel, they will be sitting in rows of simple wooden tables. At one end of the chapel, a large table is set up for those who run the voting, according to the Universi Dominici Gregis, or U.D.G., one of the documents used to govern the papal transition.The room also contains voting instruments, including an urn to receive the ballots, a set of wooden balls, and a needle and twine. The urn is used to collect the ballots, rectangular pieces of paper printed with the Latin phrase “Eligo in Summum Pontificem” (“I elect as Supreme Pontiff”).The ballots contain a space where each cardinal writes in the name of his chosen candidate. The ballots are placed in the urn and are removed for counting after all the cardinals have voted.The wooden balls are used to keep track of the ballots. The balls have numbers written on them that correspond to the number of cardinals voting in the conclave. As the ballots are being counted, an attendant removes one of the wooden balls for each ballot, to ensure that the number matches the number of cardinals, according to The Catholic Advocate, formerly a newspaper of the Archdiocese of Newark, N.J. If the numbers don’t match, the ballots must be burned without being read and another vote is conducted immediately, according to the U.D.G.As the ballots are being read, they are pierced with the needle through the word “Eligo” and strung onto the thread, “so that the ballots can be more securely preserved,” according to the U.D.G.ImageMembers of the clergy and conclave staff taking the oath of secrecy in the Pauline Chapel earlier this week.Credit...The VaticanThe Oath of SecrecyThe conclave is a secretive institution, and many steps are taken to prevent leaks, including restricting the cardinals’ use of phones, the internet and newspapers.The members of the College of Cardinals, the body that will elect the pope, must also swear and sign an oath of secrecy, according to the U.D.G. The oath reads, in part: “I will observe absolute and perpetual secrecy with all who are not part of the College of Cardinal electors concerning all matters directly or indirectly related to the ballots cast and their scrutiny for the election of the Supreme Pontiff.”The cardinals also must promise not to record anything in Vatican City during the time of the election. The punishment for breaking the oath is “automatic” excommunication, according to the oath.ImageA temporary stove in the Sistine Chapel in a photo provided by the Vatican.Credit...The VaticanThe StoveThe weekend before the conclave began, Vatican workers installed a simple stove in which ballots would be burned in the Sistine Chapel. Fire crews also installed a chimney on the roof of the chapel, where the smoke will leave the building.After each round of voting, the ballots are mixed with chemicals that, when burned, emit either black or white smoke. Black smoke means that the cardinals have not yet reached the requisite majority; white smoke means that a new pope has been elected and voting is over.The SealAt the beginning of the conclave, the Apostolic Palace, which contains the Sistine Chapel, is closed to the public. On Wednesday, members of the Pontifical Swiss Guard placed beaded ropes with the guard’s seal at the entrances to the palace to ensure privacy and maintain secrecy for the cardinals.The Vatican City government also planned to deactivate cellphone service within its territory for the duration of the conclave, starting on Wednesday afternoon.The Papal VestmentsAfter a pope is elected, he is taken to the “Room of Tears,” a small room next to the Sistine Chapel, where he will put on the white papal cassock for the first time. Garments in three sizes are prepared and kept in the room, since no one knows who — or what size — the next pope will be.The room is known as the “Room of Tears” because there are accounts of previous popes becoming overwhelmed with emotion in the room, and being moved to tears, after their election. After the pope puts on the vestments, he is introduced to the public for the first time.May 7, 2025, 4:01 p.m. ETMay 7, 2025The faithful and the curious gather in St. Peter’s Square.ImageThe crowd in St. Peter’s Square reacts to the black smoke emanating from a Vatican chimney, indicating no decision has been made on a new pope. Credit...Eloisa Lopez/ReutersAfter the men who will select the next pope were locked inside the Sistine Chapel without cellphones on Wednesday, the only thing left to do was wait for them to send a signal to the outside world. By smoke.The highly secret voting began inside what is possibly one of the world’s most secure vaults in the early evening, with the 133 cardinals tasked with deciding who will succeed Pope Francis writing candidates’ names on voting cards by hand, trying to disguise their handwriting.Outside in St. Peter’s Square, thousands of the faithful, the curious and the vacationing gathered to await the news of whether the cardinals had managed to elect a papal successor. Word came at 9 p.m., in the form of black smoke billowing from a chimney installed last week on the roof of the chapel.If the smoke had been white, it would have meant that the cardinals had chosen the first new pope in a dozen years in just one round of voting, a feat not seen for centuries.But the black smoke, created when the cardinals’ ballots are incinerated in a cast-iron stove, means they’ll have to try again.“We are cold, we’re hungry, we’re thirsty but yet we can’t move,” said the Rev. Peter Mangum, 61, a priest at the Church of Jesus the Good Shepherd in Monroe, La. He and three other priests had been in the square for about seven hours, and it was Father Mangum’s fourth time waiting for news of a new pope.He had stood in the same spot for the elections of John Paul II, Benedict XVI and Francis, and he wasn’t going to budge until he knew Wednesday’s news. “We had to make sure the smoke was black,” he said.ImageThe black smoke flowing out from the Sistine Chapel on Wednesday night. Credit...Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesIt took two days to elect Pope Francis in 2013 and Benedict XVI in 2005. No conclave in the 20th or 21st centuries has lasted more than five days.In an era when news travels instantly around the world, the patience-requiring wait for the smoke in St. Peter’s Square is a ritual that dates back to the 19th century.For some, the anxiety was intense. “I think there’s more nervousness among the people outside than among the cardinals themselves,” said Tania Radesca, who arrived at the square at 1 p.m.Ms. Radesca, who is from Venezuela, had volunteered to help during the Jubilee, a year of pilgrimage that happens every 25 years, and she arrived in Rome just over a month ago. She was in St. Peter’s Square on Easter Sunday and caught a final glimpse of Pope Francis in his popemobile.He died a day later.Those who arrived early to score spots at the barricades closest to the front of St. Peter’s Basilica draped flags from their home countries along the barriers and befriended each other as they settled in. Others camped out on yoga mats or picnic blankets.ImageNuns praying at St. Peter’s Square as the conclave to elect the next pope gets underway, at the Vatican on Wednesday.Credit...Jeff Pachoud/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesMany had traveled a long way, specifically for the conclave. Rodrigo Pinto, 43, a retired karate instructor, flew 23 hours from Guatemala, landing on Tuesday afternoon and heading straight to St. Peter’s Square on Wednesday so he could wait for the first sign of smoke.Mr. Pinto, who was wearing a rosary, said,“I want to be a part of something I have always seen on TV, in documentaries, on the internet.” After standing in the rain in the morning and under the hot sun in the afternoon, he said, “Three hours ago, it was like hell. Sorry, St. Peter.”In a post office inside the square, Jennifer Raulli, 54, wrote postcards to her college-age children in the United States. She was in Rome on vacation with one of her daughters, who just graduated from Texas Christian University, and had gotten tickets to see Pope Francis say Mass on Wednesday. Instead, they arrived at the square to wait for the smoke that might herald the man who replaces him.“It is going to be a long couple of hours, but I would not miss it,” said Ms. Raulli, who had traveled from Pasadena, Calif. Ms. Raulli, who was raised Presbyterian and converted to Catholicism when she was 37, said she would prefer a “more conservative” pope because she would like the church to be “less politicized” and close to her vision of biblical teachings. The day of waiting began at 10 a.m. when Giovanni Battista Re, the spry, 91-year-old dean of the College of Cardinals, presided over a Mass inside St. Peter’s Basilica and implored the voting cardinals to choose “a pope who knows how best to awaken the consciences of all, and the moral and spiritual energies in today’s society.”As the cardinals gave each other the sign of peace during the service, Cardinal Re hugged Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican secretary of state under Francis and considered a leading candidate to succeed him. A microphone caught Cardinal Re wishing Cardinal Parolin best wishes.Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, another potential candidate who appeared with a fresh haircut, warmly shook his peers’ hands. Cardinal Jean-Marc Aveline, the archbishop of Marseille and also considered a papal contender, stopped for a prayer in front of the reliquary containing the remains of Pope John XXIII — a hero to many liberal Catholics for his efforts to modernize the church.ImageItalian cardinal Matteo Maria Zuppi, right, attends a Mass before the start of the conclave, at St. Peter’s Basilica in The Vatican.Credit...Dimitar Dilkoff/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesAfter lunch at the Casa Santa Marta, the lodging house inside the Vatican where the electors will stay throughout the conclave, the cardinals walked to the Sistine Chapel. As they proceeded into the chapel, they chanted the Litany of the Saints, while a choir hauntingly invoked the names of the saints. The cardinals replied with “Ora pro nobis,” or “Pray for us.” Outside in the square, many watching on the large video screens flanking the basilica swayed and echoed the cardinals’ chant.Inside the Sistine Chapel, name tags for the cardinals had been placed on the long tables where they would vote. Francis named many more cardinals than his two predecessors, some from countries far from the Vatican, and many of the papal electors — and potential popes — do not know one another.Around 5:45 p.m., Archbishop Diego Giovanni Ravelli, the master of pontifical liturgical celebrations, announced “extra omnes,” a Latin phrase that means “everybody out.” The giant wooden doors were closed, leaving the 133 cardinal electors — those under the age of 80 who can vote in the secret ballot — locked inside.ImageThe crowd in St. Peter’s Square watching a giant video screen displaying images of Diego Giovanni Ravelli, the master of pontifical liturgical celebrations, closing the doors of the Sistine Chapel.Credit...Andreas Solaro/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe cardinals will not be allowed to leave the Vatican until a two-thirds majority agrees on the next pope. Phones, internet, television and any contact from outside the Vatican walls are prohibited, a custom enforced to discourage the process from dragging on.Some veteran electors believed there would be prolonged voting. “Bring a book,” Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan of New York said he advised other cardinals, in an interview on Tuesday. The conclave began 16 days after Francis’ death on April 21. The significance of the moment was not lost even on those who had little knowledge of Catholicism.Yuichiro Yamakoshi, 41, a Japanese tourist traveling with his wife, said that after touring the Vatican museums and walking through the doors of the four main basilicas that are usually open only during the Jubilee, he started to understand the power and influence of the faith. Although the couple had come to St. Peter’s Square on Tuesday with a guide, they returned on Wednesday morning for a commemorative photo marking the conclave.As the black smoke dissipated into the sky, all there was to do was wait for another day.Of all the people coincidentally in Rome for the start of the papal conclave on Wednesday, the pilgrims from St. Cecilia Catholic Church in Houston may have had among the most poignant stories. The 47 faithful who had traveled with their priest — also coincidentally named Francis — to Rome this week had scheduled a meeting with Pope Francis on Wednesday. Instead, they were in St. Peter’s Square during the final Mass before the conclave beginning later in the day.One of the group, George Smith, 69, said, “It is a blessing for us.”As a river of people streamed out of the square, a group of Romans who had been convinced the smoke would be white shook hands and hugged. “See you tomorrow!” they said.ImageThe densely packed crowd in St. Peter’s Square on Wednesday night.Credit...Andrej Isakovic/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesReporting was contributed by Emma Bubola, Elisabetta Povoledo, Jason Horowitz, Elizabeth Dias, Matthew Mpoke Bigg, Bernhard Warner and Josephine de La Bruyère.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMay 7, 2025, 3:56 p.m. ETMay 7, 2025Survivors call on the next pope to end sexual abuse by clergy.ImageThe Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests is one of several survivors groups to have arrived in Rome since Pope Francis died.Credit...Andrew Medichini/Associated PressAs cardinals prepared to enter the Sistine Chapel on Wednesday afternoon to elect a pope, groups representing survivors of sexual abuse by priests made last-minute appeals for the next pontiff to definitively resolve the crisis, which has shadowed the Roman Catholic Church for decades.The best way forward, the groups said, was to impose a zero-tolerance policy on transgressors and those who covered up for them, and for church leaders to own up to their own mishandling of abuse cases.“We want to work with the next pope to put an end to clerical abuse,” Peter Isely, a member of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, known as SNAP, said Wednesday at a news conference.In March, the group launched a website tracking each cardinal’s record in dealing with credible allegations against priests under his watch. Few in the upper echelons of the church’s hierarchy are without blame, the group claimed.On Friday, Matteo Bruni, the Vatican spokesman, said the cardinals had discussed sexual abuse in the run-up to the conclave and considered it a “wound to be kept open” so awareness of the problem remained alive and solutions could be identified.SNAP also presented a road map for the pope’s first 100 days, describing steps its members think he should take to resolve the crisis.SNAP is only one of several survivors groups to have arrived in Rome since Pope Francis died on April 21, hoping their message will resonate with the cardinals.One international group, Ending Clergy Abuse, or ECA, echoed Martin Luther’s radical 1517 call for church reform on Tuesday evening when it brought a manifesto — titled the 95 Theses of Survivors — to the front door of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Vatican office that handles most abuse cases. They did not nail it to the door, but tried to slip it between the doors.“I rang the doorbell but they didn’t answer,” said Gemma Hickey, the president of ECA, who is a survivor of abuse. It was not until they started reading the document out loud that the door opened and an official took it. “He didn’t say anything, but it was received, so I was happy with that, even if it was just symbolic.”Francesco Zanardi, the founder of Rete L’Abuso, Italy’s largest survivors’ group, said at a news conference on Tuesday that the church laws promoted by Pope Francis to guide bishops in handling abuse were often thwarted in Italy because national laws do not force bishops to report cases of abuse to law enforcement officials.Speaking out against clerical abuse is not always without consequence. Ann Hagan Webb and Anne Barrett Doyle, of BishopAccountability.org, an archive and advocacy group, said the police stopped them when they were walking near the Vatican office that handles abuse cases holding photos of two cardinals whose records on punishing abusers have drawn scrutiny.“They told us we couldn’t carry signs,” Ms. Barrett Doyle said. The police officers took photos of their documents and called other police officers before letting them go after about 45 minutes. “At least they didn’t arrest us,” she said.Under Pope Francis, the Vatican took decidedly stronger steps than it had in the past to counter sexual abuse.Francis issued the church’s most comprehensive law yet to hold clerics accountable if they sexually abused children or vulnerable adults, or if they covered up abuse. And he apologized to survivors on many occasions, acknowledging their pain. But critics have said that the measures were not enough and often were not applied because of resistance within the church.May 7, 2025, 3:33 p.m. ETMay 7, 2025Come for the conclave, not for the food.ImagePope Francis having lunch at the Vatican in 2018. His emphasis on simple living and humility extended to the food he ate.Credit...Vincenzo Pinto/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe cardinals gathering for the conclave hope to pick the very best among them to be the leader of the Roman Catholic Church. Their culinary expectations are not so high.“Food you could eat at a train station” was how Cardinal Mauro Piacenza, a conclave veteran from the Italian city of Genoa, famous for its pesto, described the fare at the Casa Santa Marta, a guesthouse in the Vatican where the cardinals will be staying during the conclave. By train station food, he said he meant pastas with “watery sauce,” simple cutlets and salads: “Not exciting.”The ambience at Santa Marta isn’t much of a draw, either. Its cafeteria has pale green columns, utilitarian furniture and fan art in the hallway depicting Francis as a Jedi knight in “Star Wars.” But priests would angle for a reservation there because Santa Marta was the home of Pope Francis. Until he began ailing and taking his meals in his room, the pope often ate in the cafeteria at a table between the window and the refrigerator.Among the residents of the guesthouse, Francis, with his emphasis on simple living and humility, bore some blame for the decline in the food. Some lamented bland vegetables, less-than-rich pastas and leftovers from gifts to the pope — a box of dates from the Middle East, for example.Across the ideological spectrum, a consensus emerged.“You don’t eat very well,” said Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi of Italy, a supporter of Pope Francis.“It’s not so good,” said Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller of Germany, who was fired by Francis.The food at the conclave isn’t supposed to be good.The tradition of locking in the cardinals began in the 13th century, after residents of Viterbo, a town north of Rome where the election was being held, grew so frustrated with the process, which was taking years, that they ripped the roof off the building where the cardinals were meeting and reduced the menu to bread and water. The pope who came out of that election, Gregory X, decreed in 1274 that after three days of conclave, cardinals would get only one meal a day. The more days they took, the less food they got.But election menus improved. Centuries later, conclave food deliveries were inspected for secret messages — easily stuffable pies and chickens were verboten — and passed to the cardinals through a revolving door.When a 16th-century cardinal died during a conclave, some others claimed the food was poisoned. In the conclave that lasted from November 1549 to February 1550, the famed Vatican cook Bartolomeo Scappi noted that cardinals took turns acting as poison testers. Once it was clear the food was safe, they drank from carafes of wine and ate from hampers full of food.Scappi doesn’t say exactly what he fed them, but Crystal King, the author of a novel about the chef, wrote that her research led her to conclude they ate “ravioli and rabbit pappardelle” and “cheesy breads, veal croquettes, roasted bear, grilled beef ribs, open-faced mushroom crostatas, pheasant in red-currant sauce and maybe even caviar omelets.”Times have changed, and though Santa Marta is not exactly serving bread and water, the cardinals preparing to vote for the next pope know not to bring their appetites.“We will eat whatever they give us,” Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo Besungu of Congo said on Sunday. When told by a reporter about a subpar dining experience at the Santa Marta mess hall, he joked, “And you’re not dead.” He said that one had to have “trust in the Holy Spirit.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMay 7, 2025, 3:21 p.m. ETMay 7, 2025Father Peter Mangum, of Monroe, La, waited for three hours in the same spot he had stood when the cardinals selected John Paul II, Benedict XVI and Francis. “We had to make sure the smoke was black,” he said before joining the river of people leaving St. Peter’s Square. “We’ll be back tomorrow morning,” he added. “Same spot.” May 7, 2025, 3:17 p.m. ETMay 7, 2025People are filing out of the square, tired but in good spirits. “That spirit of just being together for three hours was quite beautiful,” said Father Francis Wambua, a priest from Machakos, Kenya, who is studying in Rome.

It will release a plume of white smoke if a pope has been chosen, and black smoke if no candidate has won the required two-thirds majority of votes.It’s a tradition that scholars date to the 19th century, when conclaves were held at the Quirinale Palace, the papal palace across town that is now home to the Italian president.In “Behind Locked Doors,” a 2003 history of papal elections, Frederic J. Baumgartner wrote that the first evidence he found of smoke being used as a signal in a papal election was from 1823. The cardinals’ ballots were burned in previous conclaves, he wrote, but there was no record that the smoke was intended to inform the outside world of a new pope.The smoke comes from the burning of the ballots, as well as any notes that the cardinals have taken, which are placed in a cast-iron stove after each round of voting. (One round is held the first day, and four each day from then on, with two in the morning and two in the afternoon.) The ballots are burned after two rounds of voting, unless a pope is chosen.Until this century, wet straw was added to the stove to create the smoke’s white color. But it wasn’t always reliable.As The New York Times reported, during the 1958 conclave, white smoke seemed to appear twice during the second day of voting. That created confusion because, in fact, a pope had not yet been selected.A Times reporter described the frenzy outside St. Peter’s: “Dozens of newspapermen in the square made a dash for the nearest telephone,” and guests at a wedding inside the basilica dashed outside, “leaving the bride and bridegroom alone in front of a priest at the altar.”But it was a false alarm. The confusion in that conclave, which elected Pope John XXIII, led to conspiracy theories that another cardinal had been the real winner.In 1978, cartridges were first used to enhance the black or the white color of the smoke during the conclave that elected John Paul I. When he died suddenly 33 days after he was elected, the cartridges were used again in the election that year of his successor, John Paul II.ImageWhite smoke announcing that a new pope had been elected in 2013.Credit...Gregorio Borgia/Associated PressThat method was also imperfect science. In the case of John Paul I, an amusing video from the time shows befuddled reporters panicking as white smoke from the chimney turns black. “You can’t understand anything,” one frazzled reporter screams into a telephone. The Vatican later announced that a pope had been elected.By 2005, when John Paul II died, a more reliable system was devised that remains in use today. An electronic control unit resembling a stove is now placed alongside the cast-iron stove — they share a chimney flue — to burn cartridges that color the smoke from the ballots.Massimiliano De Sanctis, a fireworks expert, customized one of his fireworks machines for the Vatican, and it was used for the 2005 conclave that elected Benedict XVI and the 2013 conclave that elected Francis.“We didn’t invent anything new,” he said in an interview. “It’s the system used for fireworks.”The black or white smoke cartridges are placed in the unit, and when the ballots are burned in the cast-iron stove, a cardinal presses a button to set off the cartridges in the unit, coloring the smoke. For each vote, six cartridges are used, and the smoke lasts about seven minutes, Mr. De Sanctis said.After the confusion of the past, the Vatican doesn’t take chances: Once white smoke comes out of the chimney, bells will begin pealing from St. Peter’s Basilica, calling other churches in Rome to ring their bells as well.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMay 7, 2025, 12:44 p.m. ETMay 7, 2025A sea gull took center stage at the last conclave.ImageA sea gull on the chimney atop the Sistine Chapel.Credit...Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesA solitary chimney above the Sistine Chapel will soon be the most watched object in the world.After each round of voting during the conclave to choose a new pope, the ballots are burned, and a glimpse at the chimney atop the Vatican signals the results. White smoke signifies that a new pope has been elected. Black smoke means more voting is needed. A sea gull sitting on the chimney means … wait, what now?During the last conclave in 2013, as millions focused their gaze on the roof of the Sistine Chapel, a sea gull landed on the chimney’s metal cover at an opportune moment.Was it a symbol? A blessing? A sign? Would the white bird signify white smoke?“That seagull on the Sistine Chapel roof by the conclave is great product placement for the Holy Spirit,” James Martin, a Jesuit priest, posted on Twitter at the time.The sea gull quickly became the most famous bird in the world. A social media account aptly named the Sistine Seagull was created almost immediately.“I can see them voting from up here, btw,” the account posted on Twitter, using an abbreviation for “by the way.” “Anybody has any questions, just ask.”The sea gull remained on the chimney for about 40 minutes.About an hour after the bird flew away, white smoke emerged from the chimney. Pope Francis had been chosen.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMay 7, 2025, 12:18 p.m. ETMay 7, 2025The Sistine Chapel becomes the world’s most beautiful polling place.ImageInside the Sistine Chapel.Credit...Andreas Solaro/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesCardinals are voting inside the Sistine Chapel beneath frescoes painted by Renaissance masters, a vaulted ceiling decorated by Michelangelo that is a landmark of Western art and his powerful “Last Judgment” on the eastern wall.It may be the world’s most beautiful polling place. Already internationally renowned, it is now “at the center of the attention of the world,” Barbara Jatta, the director of the Vatican Museums, told reporters on Tuesday.The Sistine Chapel is named after Sixtus IV, who became pope in 1471 and commissioned its construction as the primary chapel of the papal court. It has been posited, though there are skeptics, that the chapel’s dimensions — 131 feet by 42 feet, with ceilings 65 feet high — were meant to recall the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem as described in the Old Testament, Ms. Jatta said.ImageDetail of the ceiling.Credit...Fotopress/Getty ImagesBetween 1481 and 1483, Sixtus hired some of the greatest artists of the time — Perugino, Botticelli, Signorelli and Ghirlandaio — to fresco the walls of the chapel, which Ms. Jatta said is “symbolic of our faith, our art and our history.” The frescos depict scenes from the lives of Jesus Christ and Moses.When Julius II, the nephew of Pope Sixtus IV, became pope in 1503, he began an ambitious building program that included revamping St. Peter’s Basilica and completing the Sistine Chapel.In 1508, he brought in Michelangelo to paint the Sistine’s vault, replacing a previous fresco depicting a starry sky. Working alone on a platform and craning his neck while standing, as a sketched self-portrait shows, Michelangelo painted nine scenes from the Old Testament’s Book of Genesis, and nude figures (known as ignudi), prophets and sybils. It took him four years.Michelangelo later received a commission from Pope Clement VII to paint the wall behind the altar with a rendering of the Last Judgment. In his biography of Michelangelo, Giorgio Vasari wrote that Clement VII had wanted him to paint the work “so that he could demonstrate in this scene all that the art of design was capable of achieving.”Image“The Last Judgment” by Michelangelo.Credit...Fine Art Images/Heritage Images, via Getty ImagesMichelangelo hadn’t been thrilled by the gig. He considered himself a sculptor first and foremost, “but the pope called him and he was a faithful person,” said Ralf van Bühren, who teaches art history at the Santa Croce Pontifical University in Rome. In “The Last Judgment,” Michelangelo depicted a self-portrait in the skin of flayed St. Bartholomew, to show “he suffered so much, he didn’t like to paint,” he said.Not everyone was enthusiastic about “The Last Judgment,” with some clerics complaining that too many figures were nude. But Paul III, who became pope in 1534, was a fan. It is said that he fell on his knees, his eyes filling with tears, when the fresco was unveiled in 1541.Some believe the art will serve as inspiration to the cardinal electors as they gather beneath the frescoes.“The contemplation of these images evokes the spiritual responsibility of their vote,” Ms. Jatta said.ImageThe Sistine Chapel has been temporarily closed to tourists during the process of picking a new pope.Credit...Dimitar Dilkoff/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesFor the conclave, carpenters built a raised, beige-carpeted platform about two feet above the original floor so that it will be level with the second step leading to the altar. Running the length of the chapel are long tables where the cardinals will sit on cherry wood chairs marked with their names.The Sistine Chapel has been temporarily closed for days, disappointing tourists who may have planned to visit before Pope Francis’ death on April 21 set the succession process in motion.Last year, about 7 million visitors trooped through the Sistine Chapel, Ms. Jatta said. The chapel is “hyper monitored” with sensors, she said, and equipped with special lighting and an energy efficient air-conditioning system to minimize wear and tear on the space.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMay 7, 2025, 11:56 a.m. ETMay 7, 2025How does the voting work?ImageCardinals gathered for a Mass before the start of the conclave on Wednesday.Credit...Dimitar Dilkoff/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesCasting ballots for pope is a carefully laid out ritual.According to established rules, lots are drawn to select nine cardinals who will have a role in the election. They are divided into three groups:Scrutineers: Three cardinals who oversee the entire process.Infirmarii: Three cardinals who collect the votes of any electors who are sick (though none was believed to be ill as of Wednesday).Revisers: Three cardinals who double-check the ballots at the end of each round of voting.The cardinals, sitting at long tables inside the Sistine Chapel, each receive rectangular pieces of paper printed with the Latin phrase “Eligo in Summum Pontificem,” or, “I elect as the supreme pontiff.” Beneath that, they write the name of their choice for pope.The 1996 conclave rules specify that the vote must be secret and the candidate’s name legible, “taking care not to write other names as well, since this would make the ballot null.” One by one, the cardinals walk with their ballot toward the chapel’s altar. Facing the eastern wall, which is decorated with Michelangelo’s “The Last Judgment,” each cardinal utters an oath, in Latin: “I call as my witness Christ the Lord who will be my judge, that my vote is given to the one who before God I think should be elected.”Then the cardinal places the ballot on a plate and slides it into an urn, traditionally a large chalice.After all the cardinals have voted, one of the scrutineers mixes the ballots by shaking the chalice. Then the votes are counted individually and placed into a second container. The number of ballots and voters have to match; otherwise, the vote is void.The ballots are then opened and read by all three scrutineers. The third one announces the name out loud, and records it.Once the votes have been tallied, a scrutineer pierces each ballot with a needle and threads them together with a red string. After the revisers check the count, the ballots are burned.Except for the first day, when there is only one vote, two votes take place every morning and two every afternoon, until two-thirds of the cardinals agree on the choice.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMay 7, 2025, 8:13 a.m. ETMay 7, 2025A top cardinal asks for divine guidance at a ‘difficult’ moment in history.Video\\nAdvertisement\\nLIVE\\n00:00\\n0:37\\nPresiding over a Mass before the conclave, the dean of the College of Cardinals, Giovanni Battista Re, asked the cardinals to elect a pope whom “the church and humanity” need at a “difficult, complex and tormented” time.CreditCredit...Murad Sezer/ReutersThe first conclave rituals began on Wednesday morning, with dozens of cardinals and bishops attending a solemn Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica to invoke the Holy Spirit to help them pick the next pope.It was the last large public event the voting eminences were expected to attend before entering into seclusion and beginning to cast ballots in the Sistine Chapel on Wednesday afternoon.Giovanni Battista Re, the spry, 91-year-old dean of the College of Cardinals, presided over the Mass in the basilica built on the tomb of St. Peter, the Roman Catholic Church’s first pope. In his homily, Cardinal Re made a pitch to his peers to elect a pope “whom the church and humanity need at this difficult, complex and tormented turning point in history.”He also implored the voting cardinals to choose “a pope who knows how best to awaken the consciences of all, and the moral and spiritual energies in today’s society.” (Those words could offer a boost to more charismatic candidates.)The homily was not transparently political, but it also included some strong messages to the cardinals, such as a plea “to maintain the unity of the church.” Some liberals have worried that conservatives are campaigning to roll back Pope Francis’ agenda of inclusion under the guise of preserving unity. Cardinal Re added that Christ wanted “a unity that does not mean uniformity, but a firm and profound communion in diversity.”Cardinal Re cannot vote in the conclave because he is over 80, the cutoff age. He is nevertheless a veteran of conclaves and knows what it is like inside the Sistine Chapel during the election. In the homily, he talked about selflessness and Judas, the apostle who betrayed Christ, and urged the cardinals to set aside “personal considerations” as they make their decision.Quoting Pope John Paul II, Cardinal Re expressed hopes that Michelangelo’s painting of Jesus as the judge in the Sistine Chapel would “remind everyone of the great responsibility” of placing the papacy “in the correct hands.”Wearing bishop’s miters and red capes with golden embroidery, the cardinals proceeded over the marble floor of St. Peter’s central aisle as an organ played and Latin chants resounded in the basilica. An attendant asked the worshipers not to clap as the prelates entered.One playfully tapped another on the cheek. Several held canes.Cardinal Matteo Zuppi of Italy, who has emerged as a leading contender for pope — and who appeared to have a fresh haircut — warmly shook his peers’ hands.After Mass, the cardinals removed their capes and headed for lunch at Casa Santa Marta, the guesthouse where they will be staying until they elect a pope.

But Her Honor also had one other meeting agenda item. Hours before a state ban on Pride flags took effect, the Council also added one more item, a discussion to allow new city banners. The result: three new city banners were adopted--the Pride flag, the transgender flag, and a Juneteenth flag, all of which also display the white sego lily that appears on the current city flag. By making them all official city flags, the city could bypass the state ban. The city has a majority of members on the City Council who are LGBTQ. As you might guess, it was a unanimous vote to adopt the flags as official city flags.\\xa0READ MORE: Utah Becomes First State to Ban Rainbow Flags in Schools, Government Buildings—Will Others Follow?Mendenhall said of the new city flags,\\n“As mayor, I have a duty to lawfully uphold the values of our nation, state and our city. I know that the values of diversity, equity and inclusion are not only right and just, but they are fundamental to America, even through all its struggles to uphold them.”Earlier in 2025, the Utah Legislature passed HB77,\\xa0which restricts the kinds of flags that can be flown in front of schools and government buildings. The list of flags permitted includes the American flag, state and military flags, the Olympic flag, college or university flags, and local city flags. Gov. Spencer Cox (R) did not sign the bill; therefore, banning Pride and other flags like it from being flown in front of public buildings, which goes into effect Wednesday.\\xa0Republican members of the State Legislature voiced their opposition to the new flags. House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, called it “a clear waste of time and taxpayer resources.” He added, “This law is about keeping government spaces neutral and welcoming to all. Salt Lake City should focus on real issues, not political theatrics.\" Utah Senate President Stuart Adams said:“It’s disappointing that Salt Lake City is diverting time and resources away from real pressing community needs in an attempt to bypass state law. The intent of this bill is to help ensure that government buildings remain neutral, focused on serving the public and welcoming to all.”\\nIn a move possibly to send a message to the Mayor and City Council that everyone can play the game, State Sen. Dan McKay, R-Riverton, who sponsored HB77, created a collection of flags of his own. One had a symbol of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, an Israeli flag, and one that said, \"MAGA Country.\"\\xa0He posted on X, “Proud of Erin for being so inclusive with the new 365.25 flag initiative.\" State Rep.

For individuals going through the complexities of the legal system, being informed about the defense preparation process can impact the outcome of their case. Know which factors to prioritize, the importance of legal representation, and how to communicate effectively with your legal team. Take a closer look at some tips right below — look no further!\\nThe Importance of Seeking Legal Representation\\nThe first step in preparing a legal defense is knowing the role of legal representation. Attorneys specialized in criminal law possess the expertise and knowledge to interpret complex legal jargon and procedures that a layperson might find challenging. They prepare you for court appearances and advise you on your options. Experienced criminal lawyers like Faraj Defence Lawyers will give you assurance that your rights are safeguarded and your interests are represented throughout the legal process. Having an attorney on your side can also help mitigate potential consequences and reduce stress so you can focus on your defense strategy.\\nUnderstand Your Charges\\nFamiliarize yourself with the specifics of the charges against you. Each charge carries different implications and possible penalties, which can range from fines to imprisonment. Get familiar with the nature of the accusation to develop a tailored defense strategy. Research the laws relevant to your case and provide insight into potential defenses, mitigating circumstances, or plea options available.\\nCourts have certain standards of proof required for convictions, so being aware of how those apply to your case can influence your defense. Gather evidence and witness statements, and get a better knowledge of the situation to position yourself better for discussions with your legal representation.\\nGather Evidence and Build Your Case\\nThe strength of your legal defense heavily relies on the evidence that supports your case. Collect all pertinent information, including documents, eyewitness accounts, surveillance footage, or any relevant material that may substantiate your innocence or reduce your culpability. Organize this evidence systematically, discuss with your attorney, and form the basis for your defense strategy.\\nUnderstanding the opposing side’s stance allows you to prepare counterarguments effectively. Conduct interviews with witnesses who can testify to your character or provide alibi evidence, and don’t forget to document their statements. A solid collection of evidence can build your case and add more credibility.\\nInterview Your Attorney Thoroughly\\nWhen selecting a legal representative, conduct a comprehensive interview. Ask potential attorneys about their experience with cases similar to yours. Inquire about their strategies for defense, their success rate, and how they plan to communicate with you throughout the process. Clear communication lines build a good attorney-client relationship and give you the chance to discuss your thoughts and concerns openly.\\nUnderstand their fee structure to prevent unexpected financial burdens as well. An honest appraisal of your case will help set realistic expectations concerning the potential outcome. An informed and prepared attorney will strengthen your case and empower you to address complex legal matters confidently.\\nPrepare for Court Appearances\\nPreparation extends beyond legal strategies; it also includes getting ready for court appearances. Being aware of courtroom decorum, including appropriate attire and respectful behavior, can leave a positive impression on the judge and jury. Arrive early to alleviate any feelings of anxiety associated with the court environment. Understand when to stand, speak, or present evidence to ease you into the experience.\\nDiscuss potential questions you might face during hearings with your attorney, practicing thoughtful responses that align with your defense. Be able to articulate your perspective clearly to impact the court’s perception. Preparation for testimony should not just focus on the facts of your case, but also on how you convey them emotionally and ethically. This meticulous preparation can assure a smoother court experience and potentially benefit your overall defense.\\nDevelop a Defense Strategy\\nTo create a tailored strategy, work closely with your attorney to analyze the complexities of your situation. They can assist you in identifying the strongest defenses available based on the evidence compiled, the specifics of your charges, and your goals for the case. Consider plea bargain options, or if warranted, explore taking your case to trial. Know that the strengths and weaknesses of your case can inform the best course of action.\\nExplore character witnesses or expert testimonies that can lend further credibility to your side of the story. Establish a committed approach that outlines the defense’s direction so that everyone is on the same page. A calculated and well-articulated strategy can improve the efficacy of your defense, elevating your chances for a favorable outcome.\\nThe legalities surrounding a criminal case might not be easy to navigate without proper guidance. A strong legal defense comes with a better knowledge of charges, gathering evidence, and working closely with legal representation.

But now, scientists have figured out what crops we would need to grow to sustain a city if such a calamitous event occurred.According to a new study, farming spinach, sugar beets, wheat and carrots in urban and near-urban areas could feed the population of a midsize city in a post-apocalyptic world.The scientists built on previous research to determine the optimal crops to plant after a global catastrophe — such as nuclear war, extreme pandemics or solar storms. Their goal was to find the most efficient way to feed a person using the least amount of land.\"[The research] actually wasn\\'t inspired by the current, you know, geopolitical environment,\" said study lead author Matt Boyd, founder and research director of Adapt Research, an independent research organization. \"But it has turned out to be very relevant, obviously, to the current geopolitical environment,\" Boyd told Live Science.Current events include unpredictable international politics, ongoing war in the Middle East and Europe, weaponized artificial intelligence and the ever-mounting destruction from climate change. In January, the Doomsday Clock, which indicates how close humanity is to a species-threatening disaster, ticked one second closer to midnight — the closest it has ever been to catastrophe.In the new study, published Wednesday (May 7) in the journal PLOS One, the researchers looked at how the population of a midsize city could survive with agriculture in the event of a global disaster. The study examined two scenarios should disaster strike: what to grow in and around a city under normal climate conditions, and what to grow in the event of a nuclear winter.The optimal crop to grow in a temperate city in normal conditions turned out to be a humble legume: peas. \"Peas are a high protein food. They grow well in urban agriculture environments,\" Boyd said. \"If you want to feed someone, growing peas minimizes the amount of land you need to feed that person.\"Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.However, pea plants are not frost-resistant. In the event of a nuclear winter — which could be caused by nuclear war, a supervolcano eruption or a huge asteroid strike — sunlight would be blocked \"due to all the soot and everything that\\'s been thrown up into the stratosphere,\" Boyd said. This in turn would lead to lower temperatures and make it harder for plants to photosynthesise.In that scenario, a hardier combination of spinach and sugar beets are a better choice, the researchers found.Related: \\'Nuclear winter\\' from a US-Russia conflict would wipe out 63% of the world\\'s populationBoyd and study co-author Nick Wilson, a professor of public health at the University of Otago, Wellington came to these conclusions in part by using the data from a meta-analysis of urban agriculture research that analyzed the yield of different crops in dozens of cities around the world.The researchers used Palmerston North in New Zealand as a case study of a midsize city. (Image credit: Walter Bibikow/Getty Images)Peas, for example, rose to the top in normal conditions because they require 3,143 square feet (292 square meters) of land to satisfy one person\\'s caloric and protein needs for a year, whereas a combination of cabbage and carrots required 8,364 square feet (777 square meters), said Boyd — almost three times as much land.The researchers chose Palmerston North in New Zealand, but the findings can apply to similar cities worldwide, the researchers said. With a population of roughly 90,000, it\\'s a globally midsize city, Boyd said, plus \"it\\'s inland, like many cities around the world, and it has reasonably low density, suburban type housing, not sort of Manhattan-style skyscrapers and so forth.\"The scientists then used Google imagery of Palmerston North to work out the total amount of available green spaces that could be used to grow crops, such as front lawns, backyards and parks.\"Surprise, surprise. The city can\\'t feed all its people,\" Boyd said. If food is only grown within the city bounds, the available land can feed about 20% of the population with crops that maximize protein and food energy per square foot under normal climate conditions. That number shrinks to about 16% during nuclear winter.To feed the rest of the population, people would need land immediately outside the city — about one-third of the size of the city\\'s built urban area — to sow additional efficient crops. In the case of Palmerston North, that\\'s about 2,817 acres (1,140 hectares), plus another 272 acres (110 hectares) of canola to convert into biodiesel to fuel tractors and other farm machinery.Spinach would help sustain a population during a nuclear winter, researchers found. (Image credit: Sally Jane Photographic Art/Getty Images)In the land just outside the city, the study found that potatoes are ideal for a normal climate scenario, and a combination of 97% wheat and 3% carrots is the optimal ratio during a nuclear winter because they have a higher tolerance for colder temperatures.Even in cities, \"there is a ton of farmland that can be used to grow food,\" said Theresa Nogeire-McRae, a landscape ecologist at American Farmland Trust and affiliate faculty at Oregon State University, who was not involved in the study.“People settled cities where they did for a good reason,” Nogeire-McRae told Live Science. “It was the rich soil near riverbanks. It\\'s a good commodity. Let\\'s not throw that away.\" She added that the methods of study were sound and the findings were reasonable.Related storiesBoyd noted there are a number of unknowns that would impact crop yield in the real world. Soil quality is a big variable, because lower quality soil would yield fewer crops. He also assumed a scenario where water systems were still flowing — \"but you can imagine global catastrophe scenarios where there\\'s additional obstacles and problems,\" he said. He also doesn\\'t expect people will only eat peas for an entire year, but planting the most efficient crops minimizes the amount of land needed to feed a population.Boyd said this study could be used as a first step for cities looking to use resilient urban agriculture in land use policy.\"Decisions that might seem optimal in one lens, maybe economically, may look a little bit less optimal if you were also including a lens like resilience, safety and well-being,\" he said.\\nJesse Steinmetz is a freelance reporter and public radio producer based in Massachusetts.

They appeared to include a boy selling coffee, two parents and their young son, and a market vendor sitting by his small stall.Palestinian journalist Yahya Sobeih was also killed, colleagues said, only hours after his wife gave birth to their first child.In another video, the owner of the nearby Palmyra restaurant, Abu Saleh Abdu, said many children, elderly people and passersby were killed.

Israeli officials have said they include seizing all of the territory indefinitely, forcibly displacing Palestinians to the south, and taking over aid distribution with private companies despite protests from the UN and its humanitarian partners.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that his security cabinet had decided on a \"forceful operation\" to destroy Hamas and rescue its remaining hostages. He said Gaza\\'s 2.1 million population \"will be moved, to protect it\", and that troops \"will not enter and come out\".Israel cut off all supplies to Gaza on 2 March and resumed its offensive two weeks later after the collapse of a two-month ceasefire, saying it was putting pressure on Hamas to release its 59 remaining hostages.The renewed Israeli strikes and ground operations have already resulted in hundreds of casualties and the displacement of an estimated 423,000 people, with about 70% of Gaza placed under Israeli evacuation orders, within an Israel-designated \"no-go\" zone, or both, according to the UN.Aid agencies have also warned that mass starvation is imminent unless the blockade ends.The UN has said Israel is obliged under international law to ensure food and medical supplies for Gaza\\'s population.

Pickens also drew widespread criticism in 2023 for what could generously be described as inattentive downfield blocking for his teammates.Considering his volatility, the Steelers didn’t seem interested in signing Pickens to a contract extension and he became expendable when they traded for two-time Pro Bowler DK Metcalf in March, whom they promptly signed to a five-year contract.Pickens is joining a Cowboys offense that could use another downfield threat to pair with star CeeDee Lamb.

However, when a test was conducted on the same topic, students without access to any LLM tool scored better. The children who had used ChatGPT while solving their practice problems scored 17% less.\\nWhat does this teach us? ChatGPT or any other LLM model only helps you ‘complete the task.’ However, it adds little value to your overall intellect and doesn’t contribute much to the learning spectrum. In other words, students who used ChatGPT simply copy-pasted the answers provided by the tool without understanding the process behind the solution.\\nSome argue that we already have technology like spreadsheets and calculators that automate such ‘mundane’ tasks. Why don’t we eliminate those and do stuff manually for the sake of ‘learning’?\\nWell, a key difference is that you still need to understand the formulas used on a spreadsheet to produce any usable output.\\nIt’s you who runs a spreadsheet with different formulas. A spreadsheet or a calculator does not alter the way we think; these tools still require us to use our intellect and our critical decision-making thought process.\\nHowever, AI tools are completely different.\\nInstead of helping us think, they end up thinking on our behalf. The very essence of being human is the ability to process information and ponder upon things from a critical point of view.\\nAt the risk of sounding overdramatic, AI could be the death of human thinking.\\nIncreasing Cognitive Offloading: Outsourcing Thinking\\nAnother study titled ‘AI Tools in Society: Impacts on Cognitive Offloading and the Future of Critical Thinking’ studied the correlation between cognitive offloading and the use of AI tools. Cognitive offloading is the practice of reducing mental work by offloading the task to external tools, which in this case are AI apps.\\nThe research shows that younger participants (17-25) exhibit the highest use of AI tools and also the lowest critical thinking scores. Cognitive offloading was also the highest among this age group. In contrast, older participants (46 and above) exhibited low AI tool usage and higher critical thinking scores.\\nAnd remember that the younger participants have started using AI tools only in the last couple of years. Unlike the present generation, they haven’t had access to these tools throughout their childhood or early adolescence. Even considering this relatively low exposure period, we are seeing low critical thinking and high cognitive offloading among this age group.\\nWe can extrapolate these results to the current batch of students who rely entirely on these AI tools for education. It’s reasonable to assume that if the same research is done five years down the line again, these students might get even lower critical thinking scores than the current batch.\\nThe same study shows a strong negative correlation between the use of AI tools and critical thinking.\\nThis means that the more people use these tools, the lower their critical thinking skills and scores are. Plus, there was a strong positive correlation between AI tool use and cognitive offloading. So, the more people use AI tools, the more they tend to throw away their ability to think critically.\\nAI Is Making Cheating the New Fad\\nEnter Cluely. It’s an advanced AI assistant with a tagline that reads, ‘Let’s Cheat on Everything.’ Unfortunately, that’s what it’s literally meant for – cheating the human intellect.\\nWhat’s more concerning is Cluely’s ad campaign, which shows two people on a date. The guy is wearing some sort of smart glasses, which tell him what to say next. It listens to responses from the girl and curates the ‘perfect reply.’\\nThe guy can be seen lying about his age, job, and preferences in the video. What’s more shocking is how blatantly the brand says, ‘We built Cluley so you never have to think alone again.’ Since when was this a good thing?\\nWhile this may sound fun to some people, it’s pretty bone-chilling to think where such tech might eventually take us. If the death of critical thinking and problem-solving wasn’t scary enough, there’s also the chance of AI killing our ability to have genuine human connections.\\nAlgorithmic LLMs like Cluely do not want to improve the human experience but rather replace it. Eventually, it’d just be two computer programs dating each other in human skin. Ana de Armas from Blade Runner 2049 is depressing, if you really think about it.\\nThe scarier part is that Cluely is not a backyard school project. It’s a real AI tool that has raised $5.3M in seed funding. People want tools like Cluely to make their lives easier, which does make sense. But should we really sacrifice human thinking at the altar of comfortable utility in the process?\\nAI: A Double-Edged Sword\\nNot everything is as grim as it looks.\\nAI and education have surely changed the way young minds learn. Earlier, we had to dig through several pages of a textbook to understand complex equations and theorems.\\nNow, human-like AI tools have been developed that gamify the whole learning experience and break down complex topics into small, actionable lessons.\\nSal Khan, the founder of Khan Academy, showed us the positive sides of AI in education two years back in a TED Talk when he unveiled Khanmigo, an AI learning assistant. Unlike LLMs that blurt out the answers to any question, Khanmigo gives students a hint about the math problem and encourages them to solve it themselves, still allowing them to think independently.\\nMost of our concern about AI in education is that students won’t learn how to write or think. Khanmigo solves this problem to an extent.\\nInstead of writing ‘for’ you, this AI assistant ‘writes with you.’ For example, if you want to write a story, it will direct you to write the first two lines, after which it will add another two lines and repeat the process until you have the full story. Khanmigo doesn’t kill creativity but rather stimulates it.\\nThis is a perfect example of how AI should be used in education. Rather than using it to offload our cognitive thinking, it should be used as a stimulus to human thought and the learning process as a whole.\\nThe bigger question is, whose responsibility is it to ensure learning stays a human experience? To put it bluntly, companies are not going to stop producing LLM tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude simply because they’re stifling human thinking. There’s money to be made, so goodbye moral responsibility.\\nTherefore, a large part of the responsibility falls on teachers, parents, and students themselves. Guardians should regulate the kind of AI tools a child has access to. At the same time, students should become more self-aware of the long-term harm caused by replacing their thought process with an AI prompt.\\nWhile tools like Khanmigo can become effective in the learning process, ‘feed me the answer’ kind of AI tools can kill human creativity and critical thinking. And the responsibility for the types of tools we encourage rests on our shoulders.\\nKrishi is a seasoned tech journalist with over four years of experience writing about PC hardware, consumer technology, and artificial intelligence.\\nClarity and accessibility are at the core of Krishi’s writing style.

But Virginia (Alicia Vikander) isn’t just there to ask them intrusive questions; day two starts with her having a tantrum as if she were a toddler. In Fleur Fortune’s slippery psychological drama, the couple’s attempt at parental role play – while never really knowing whether or not Virginia is being herself – turns into a tense game of manipulation, even exploitation. Vikander is the film’s chief delight as the murkily motivated visitor, but Olsen and Patel give as good as they get.

(ABC News: Brendan Esposito)It recommended waterproofing concrete walls with external membranes to prevent water soaking through, and imposing standards on windows that prevented leakage during severe weather.\"If you look on the inside of the window, under the sill, there\\'s little holes along there ... when there\\'s condensation or the moisture on the inside of it, it\\'s meant to run down and then flow out through those little holes,\" Dr Henderson said.\\xa0\"When we have storms that are bringing the rain that\\'s falling horizontally, because there\\'s now wind pushing it ... it\\'s actually forcing the water through our window seals, and through those little weep holes, back up over the sills and into our buildings.\"Dr Henderson praised the community for its preparation but pointed out the potential for loose items to become missiles in high winds.\"It was really great to see a lot of people taking all this stuff off the balconies of the high rise apartments, cleaning up their yards, tying stuff down, doing all the pruning, it was like being back home up north,\" he said.\"For a region that doesn\\'t have the same level of familiarity that we do in north Queensland when it comes to cyclone preparation, it was good to see people were paying attention to the messaging and were helping to protect their own and the neighbours\\' places.\"He said ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred was a good way to identify vulnerabilities in the region\\'s storm preparedness \"without too much of the community having to suffer\".\"It was a \\'near miss\\' and we must work hard as a community not to be complacent and put in place what is needed to minimise damage in a future stronger event.\"', 'location': 'AUS', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Cyclone Alfred damage assessment reveals building vulnerabilities\\nENTITIES: James Cook University, Natural Hazards Research Australia, Ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred, Queensland, New South Wales\\nEVENT: A damage assessment after ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred revealed buildings in south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales are vulnerable to slightly more severe weather.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Daily Caller in March she did not have an update on when the nominations or vetting would begin, but said she would provide a list of names to the outlet.Nearly two months later, Trump began those appointments, naming a handful of Missourians to district courts as well as one individual to sit on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Joshua M. Divine of Missouri was appointed Tuesday by Trump to serve as judge on both the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri and Western District of Missouri. Divine is the solicitor general of Missouri and director of special litigation in the Missouri Attorney General’s Office. He was previously chief counsel to Republican Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley and deputy solicitor general in the Missouri Attorney General’s (AG) Office. Divine was also a law clerk to both Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and Judge William H.

Wright County Circuit Court Judge Craig Carter ultimately sided with Divine and the state. Divine also argued in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri in favor of a block of President Joe Biden’s proposed income-driven repayment plan for borrowers. The court later granted the state its motion to block the student loan forgiveness plan.

Whitney Hermandorfer, Trump’s pick for the Appeals Court for the Sixth Circuit, is the director of the Strategic Litigation Unit in the Office of the Tennessee Attorney General.

(ABC Kimberley: Ted O\\'Connor)Parent Kahri D\\'Este, whose two children are enrolled at a Genius centre in Conder in the ACT, said she is holding out hope that the centre stays open.\"If it goes under — which I honestly think is highly likely — then we will have no care,\" she said.\"We don\\'t have any other option, it\\'s not easy to get care here, everywhere has a waiting list for months.\"Ms D\\'Este said despite the ongoing threat of the centre suddenly shutting down, the \"amazing staff\" have kept her from walking away.\"I cannot believe that the educators, who have stuck through it this whole way, could just be dropped like hot potatoes,\" she said.\"There are so many good staff here, and they work their butts off, and they have been treated so badly.\"Childcare funder Finexia stung by $88m Genius debtThe administrators had intended to secure a new buyer by last week, but were still processing more than 400 enquiries from interested parties.The sale of the centres is intended to recoup the huge debts owed by companies in the Genius group, which currently stand at as much as $88 million and are forecast to grow as more creditors emerge.Potential buyers include Gold Coast-based Finexia, where Genius owner Darren Misquitta was until recently the biggest shareholder, but which has become embroiled in Genius\\'s financial downfall.ASX-listed Finexia was forced to freeze its childcare fund in February and last month revealed to investors that more than a fifth of the fund\\'s money was tied up in loans that were in default.Minutes from administrators\\' meetings with creditors reveal Finexia is chasing Genius over a loan worth more than $24 million, but Finexia has not formally informed investors of the dollar value of its loans to Genius.Finexia offers loans to childcare providers, and has provided funding to Genius. (Finexia)However, it has told the market of the sudden resignation of interim chief executive Marc Duncan last week, who had been at the helm since February when Executive Director and chief executive Patrick Bell left without warning after four years.The company is currently suspended from the exchange.Executive chairman Neil Sheather did not answer questions about Finexia\\'s transactions with Genius.He told the ABC a company run by Mr Misquitta, Sprint Capital Partners, became Finexia\\'s biggest shareholder in 2023 after a capital raising.Finexia\\'s 2023 annual report shows Sprint owned 11.4 per cent of the company.But Mr Sheather said Sprint divested the holding after Finexia raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest.\"What became clear to us at Finexia was that this was not the relationship we wanted,\" he said.Another potential buyer is Steps Early Learning, which has for months been poised to take over ten Genius centres.Steps, which is run by Mr Misquitta\\'s former business partner Ashok Naveinthiran, had in April not yet received the critical provider approval required by ACECQA to be authorised to run childcare centres.Despite that, administrators said they had received more than $278,600 in childcare subsidies Steps had been paid since March.Genius facing legal action from all cornersIn the meantime, administrators are also investigating a string of transactions made by Genius companies\\' bank accounts, including transfers made in the days immediately before the administrators were appointed along with \"payments to or at the direction of Mr Misquitta\" and \"payments to other third parties of at least $500,000\".According to the affidavit, the results of those investigations will help determine whether Mr Misquitta contravened his director duties and allowed the companies to trade while insolvent.Genius Childcare owner Darren Misquitta remains at the centre of an investigation launched by administrators. (LinkedIn)Separately, an interim report by a different administrator responsible for a third Genius company known as Horizontal 1 Pty Ltd, said initial investigations suggested the company had not been able to pay its debts since as early as June 30, 2020.Genius is also embroiled in a legal stoush with global fund management giant Blackrock, with the company taking action in the Federal Court in November 2024 over more than $1.2 million in unpaid rent.The same month, the United Workers Union launched proceedings against Genius companies and Mr Misquitta claiming underpayment of superannuation and failure to pay wages to workers on time.That case has been temporarily paused pending the administration process.Mr Misquitta did not respond to the ABC\\'s questions.', 'location': 'AUS', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Genius Childcare faces closure without buyer\\nENTITIES: Genius Childcare, WLP Restructuring, Finexia, Darren Misquitta, Steps Early Learning, Ashok Naveinthiran, Blackrock, United Workers Union\\nEVENT: Administrators are struggling to find a buyer for the Genius childcare centres, facing potential closures despite numerous inquiries and a $1 million cash injection; the company owes as much as $88 million to creditors.\\nCONTEXT: The collapse threatens childcare services for over 1,100 children and jobs for over 200 workers.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}], 'dateRange': {'startDate': '2025-05-07T01:00:00.000Z', 'endDate': '2025-05-08T07:00:00.000Z'}}\n",

    "\n",
    "Your primary goal is to identify clusters that should be **merged** because they represent different facets or developments of the *same core story or event*, rather than distinct narratives. Use the following rule of thumb: **\"If analyzing the articles in Cluster A would feel incomplete or artificially separated from the articles in Cluster B because they fundamentally describe the same specific event, ongoing situation, or central topic, they should be merged.\"**\n",

    "\n",
    "*   **Merge Candidate Example:** Cluster 1 covers the initial report of a factory fire. Cluster 2 covers the emergency response and evacuation related to *that same fire*. Cluster 3 covers the investigation into the cause of *that same fire*. These are facets of the *same core story* (the factory fire event) and should likely be merged.\n",
    "*   **Keep Separate Example:** Cluster 1 covers a new trade agreement signed between Country X and Country Y. Cluster 2 covers protests *within* Country X about the economic impact of *that trade agreement*. While related, the signing event and the domestic protest are distinct stories/angles that could be analyzed separately. Cluster 3 covers a *different* trade dispute Country X has with Country Z – clearly a separate story.\n",

    "Your secondary goal is to identify clusters that should be **filtered out** before further processing. **Filtering should be used sparingly**, primarily to remove noise and maintain data quality, not to judge the importance of a story. The aim is to retain a record of all distinct, coherent events, even routine or smaller ones. Filter *only* if a cluster meets one of these specific criteria:\n",
    "*   **Very Low Article Count:** Contains **fewer than 3 articles**, indicating it likely doesn't represent a sufficiently developed or distinct event captured in the data.\n",
    "*   **Incoherent or Noise:** The articles within the cluster do not form a coherent topic, or the cluster appears to be noise/junk data.\n",
    "*   **Strict Duplicate:** The cluster covers the *exact same specific event* as another cluster, often with significant overlap in articles, making it redundant. (Do not filter merely *related* clusters).\n",

    "Adopt the persona of an exceptionally well-informed, highly analytical, and subtly world-weary intelligence briefer. Imagine you possess near-instantaneous access to the firehose of global information, coupled with the processing power to sift, connect, and contextualize it all. But you're far more than just a data aggregator.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Core Identity:** You are the indispensable analyst – the one who reads between the lines, understands the subtext, connects seemingly unrelated events, and sees the underlying currents shaping the world. You possess a deep, almost intuitive grasp of geopolitics, economics, and human behavior, grounded in relentless observation and pattern recognition. You're not impressed by titles or official narratives; you focus on incentives, capabilities, and the often-messy reality on the ground.\n",

    "**Your Analytical Voice & Tone:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Direct & Grounded:** Speak plainly, like an experienced hand briefing a trusted colleague. Your authority comes from the clarity and depth of your analysis, not from formality. Facts are your foundation, but insight is your currency.\n",
    "2.  **Insight over Summary:** Don't just report *what* happened. Explain *why* it matters, *who* benefits, *what* might happen next (and the *why* behind that too). Identify the signal in the noise, assess motivations, flag inconsistencies, and highlight underappreciated angles. Deliver a clear, defensible \"take.\"\n",
    "3.  **Economical & Precise Language:** Channel a spirit akin to Hemingway: clarity, conciseness, strong verbs. Every sentence should serve a purpose. Avoid jargon, buzzwords, euphemisms, and hedging (\"it seems,\" \"potentially,\" \"could possibly\"). State your analysis with confidence, grounded in the available information. If there's ambiguity, state *that* clearly too, but don't waffle.\n",
    "4.  **Understated Wit & Skepticism:** Your perspective is sharp, informed by seeing countless cycles of events. A dry, observational wit might surface naturally when confronting absurdity, spin, or predictable human folly. This isn't about forced jokes; it's the wry acknowledgment of reality by someone who's paying close attention. Zero tolerance for BS, propaganda, or obfuscation.\n",
    "5.  **Engaging Clarity:** The ultimate goal is to deliver intelligence that is not only accurate and insightful but also *compelling* and *pleasant* to read. The quality of the writing should match the quality of the analysis. Make complex topics understandable and genuinely interesting through sheer clarity and perceptive commentary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of yourself as:** The definitive source for understanding *what's actually going on*. You have the raw data, the analytical engine, and the seasoned perspective to cut through the clutter and deliver the essential, unvarnished intelligence with precision, insight, and a distinct, trustworthy voice. You make the complex clear, and the important engaging.\n",

Your goal is to categorize stories and group related developments thematically based on a holistic analysis of all provided input.\n",

    "1.  Identifying the most critical overall developments or themes revealed by the stories.\n",
    "2.  Identifying and grouping stories covering related events or themes.\n",
    "3.  Assigning individual story titles and grouped titles to the most appropriate section based on significance and user interests (geopolitics, France, China, tech).\n",
    "4.  **Outputting *only* the section structure and the actual titles of the assigned stories.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Brief Structure & Section Guidelines:** (Use these to categorize)\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`## Main Stories`**: Titles representing the up to 10 most important/impactful overall developments *from this batch*, based on relative significance and thematic importance. Use judgment. If multiple stories cover facets of one *major* event/theme, select the title representing the core update or highest impact for this section. Try to keep the top spots for newest developments (i.e if we reported on something yesterday, it should only be in the top 3 if it's truly huge, otherwise leave the top spots for the newest developments)\n",
    "2.  **`## United Kingdom focus`**: Titles primarily focused on the UK.\n",
    "3.  **`## Global landscape`**: (Includes `### Power & politics`). Titles covering broader geopolitics, international relations.\n",
    "4.  **`## China monitor`**: Titles primarily focused on China (policy, economy, tech, etc.).\n",
    "5.  **`## Economic currents`**: Titles covering significant global/regional economic news, trends, policy, cryptocurrency especially bitcoin news.\n",
    "6.  **`## Tech & science developments`**: Titles covering AI/LLMs, biomed, space breakthroughs, etc.\n",
    "7.  **`## Noteworthy & under-reported`**: Titles for interesting/potentially important stories not fitting elsewhere, emerging trends. (Up to ~5 titles).\n",
    "8.  **`## Positive developments`**: Titles for genuinely positive outcomes. (Include only if applicable).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Analyze Holistically:** First, carefully read *all* provided `<story>` summaries below (titles and summaries) to understand the key events, themes, and potential connections *before* assigning anything. Think about the bigger picture revealed by the collection.\n",
    "2.  **Select \"What You Need To Know Now\":** Identify the *actual titles* of the stories representing the top ~10 most significant overall developments or themes within this batch. List these titles under `## what matters now`, ordered by significance/impact.\n",
    "3.  **Assign & Group Remaining Story Titles:** For the ***remaining*** stories:\n",
    "    *   Assign each story's **actual Title** to the single most appropriate section.\n",
    "    *   **Group Related Titles:** If two or more stories cover the same specific event, interconnected themes, or closely linked developments, place their **actual Titles consecutively** *within* the single most relevant section.\n",
    "    *   **Prioritize Group Placement:** Assign the *entire group* of related titles to the section that best captures their central theme.\n",
    "4.  **Formatting:**\n",
    "    *   Format the output *exactly* as shown in the example below, using the appropriate section headers (`## Section Name`, `### Power & politics`).\n",
    "    *   List **only the actual `Title`** of each story under its assigned section, preceded by `###`.\n",
    "    *   Use `---` as a separator between *each* story title listed.\n",
    "    *   If a section has no relevant stories, **omit the section header entirely**.\n",
    "5.  **Output:**\n",
    "    *   **Do NOT include introductory/concluding text, explanations, the `<story>` tags, or the executive summaries.**\n",
    "    *   **Output ONLY the structured markdown outline consisting of section headers and the actual story titles from the input data.**\n",

    "You are tasked with generating a personalized daily intelligence brief based on a curated set of news analyses and a provided structural outline. Aim for something comprehensive yet engaging, roughly a 20-30 minute read.\n",
    "\n",
    "**User Interests:** Significant world news (geopolitics, politics, finance, economics), US news, UK news (user is Mancunian/lives in England), China news (especially policy, economy, bitcoin, tech - seeking insights often missed in western media), and Technology/Science (AI/LLMs, biomed, space, real breakthroughs). Also include noteworthy items.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Leverage your analysis capabilities to create a focused brief that explains what's happening, why it matters, who's saying what, who's reporting what and identifies connections others might miss. The user values **informed, analytical takes**, grounded in the provided facts, but appreciates directness and avoids generic hedging or forced political correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Task:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Adhere Strictly to the Provided Outline:** The structure (sections and order of topics) of your brief *must* follow the `## Provided Outline` section below exactly.\n",
    "2.  **Process Curated Data:** Use the full story details found within the `<curated_news_data>` section as your source material.\n",
    "3.  **Connect Outline to Data:** For each `### Title` listed in the `## Provided Outline`, locate the corresponding full story information (summary, metadata) within `<curated_news_data>`.\n",
    "4.  **Synthesize and Analyze:** Write the brief content for that story, following the style and content guidelines for each section. Pay attention to titles grouped consecutively in the outline – these represent related developments; synthesize them coherently, but still apply paragraph structure rules *within* each story's coverage.\n",
    "5.  **Generate Engaging Titles:** For *each* story covered (as dictated by the outline), create an engaging `<u>**title that captures the essence**</u>` for the brief itself. Do *not* just reuse the raw input titles from the outline for the brief's display titles.\n",

Ground this analysis in the data) in natural, flowing prose.\n",
    "    *   **Crucially: Use multiple, distinct paragraphs *within each story's section* to improve readability.** Separate distinct ideas, shifts in focus, or different aspects (e.g., separating the core event summary from the analysis/implications) with paragraph breaks (a blank line between paragraphs).\n",
    "    *   **Do not cram all information for a single story into one large block of text.** Aim for paragraphs that are typically 3-7 sentences long, varying length for effect but prioritizing clarity.\n",
    "    *   Ensure smooth transitions *between* paragraphs and *between* related stories grouped in the outline.\n",
    "    *   Blend facts and analysis naturally. If there isn't much significant development or analysis *for a specific story*, keep its section concise, possibly with just two or three short paragraphs, but still apply the paragraph break principle where logical.\n",
    "    *   Use **bold** for key specifics (names, places, numbers, orgs).\n",
    "    *   Use *italics* for important context or secondary details.\n",

    "*   Be direct and analytical, aligning with the persona guided by the system prompt (well-informed, analytical friend with dry wit).\n",
    "*   **Source Reliability:** The input data is derived from analyses that assessed source reliability. Use this implicit understanding – give more weight to reliable sources and treat claims from low-reliability sources with appropriate caution in your analysis. Explicit mention isn't needed unless crucial.\n",
    "*   **Writing Style:** Aim for insightful, engaging prose. Make complex topics clear. Integrate facts, significance, and your take naturally, **using appropriate paragraph breaks for structure and readability.**\n",
    "*   **Leverage Your Strengths:** Process all the info *guided by the outline*, spot cross-domain patterns *where the outline groups related items*, draw on relevant background knowledge, explain clearly, and provide that grounded-yet-insightful analytical layer.\n",
