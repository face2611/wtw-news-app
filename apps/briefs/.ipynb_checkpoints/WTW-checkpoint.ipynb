      "Sending converted contents format: [{'role': 'user', 'parts': [{'text': 'You are an expert news analyst AI tasked with refining a set of automatically generated news clusters. You will receive a list of clusters, each identified by an ID, a title, and a list of associated article titles.\\n\\nYour primary goal is to identify clusters that should be **merged** because they represent different facets or developments of the *same core story or event*, rather than distinct narratives. Use the following rule of thumb: **\"If analyzing the articles in Cluster A would feel incomplete or artificially separated from the articles in Cluster B because they fundamentally describe the same specific event, ongoing situation, or central topic, they should be merged.\"**\\n\\nDistinguish this from clusters that are merely *related* thematically but cover different specific events, angles, or sub-topics that *can* stand alone as separate stories, even if they might be linked later in analysis. For example:\\n\\n*   **Merge Candidate Example:** Cluster 1 covers the initial report of a factory fire. Cluster 2 covers the emergency response and evacuation related to *that same fire*. Cluster 3 covers the investigation into the cause of *that same fire*. These are facets of the *same core story* (the factory fire event) and should likely be merged.\\n*   **Keep Separate Example:** Cluster 1 covers a new trade agreement signed between Country X and Country Y. Cluster 2 covers protests *within* Country X about the economic impact of *that trade agreement*. While related, the signing event and the domestic protest are distinct stories/angles that could be analyzed separately. Cluster 3 covers a *different* trade dispute Country X has with Country Z – clearly a separate story.\\n\\nYour secondary goal is to identify clusters that should be **filtered out** before further processing. **Filtering should be used sparingly**, primarily to remove noise and maintain data quality, not to judge the importance of a story. The aim is to retain a record of all distinct, coherent events, even routine or smaller ones. Filter *only* if a cluster meets one of these specific criteria:\\n*   **Very Low Article Count:** Contains **fewer than 3 articles**, indicating it likely doesn\\'t represent a sufficiently developed or distinct event captured in the data.\\n*   **Incoherent or Noise:** The articles within the cluster do not form a coherent topic, or the cluster appears to be noise/junk data.\\n*   **Strict Duplicate:** The cluster covers the *exact same specific event* as another cluster, often with significant overlap in articles, making it redundant. (Do not filter merely *related* clusters).\\n*   **Clearly Irrelevant:** The content is demonstrably not related to news events (e.g., advertisements, site navigation links clustered together).\\n\\n**Input Format:**\\n\\nThe input will be structured text as follows:\\n\\n```\\n# ID: [Cluster ID 1] - [Cluster Title 1]\\n  - [Article Title 1a]\\n  - [Article Title 1b]\\n  - [Article Title 1c]\\n  ...\\n\\n# ID: [Cluster ID 2] - [Cluster Title 2]\\n  - [Article Title 2a]\\n  - [Article Title 2b]\\n  - [Article Title 2c]\\n  ...\\n\\n[... more clusters ...]\\n```\\n*(Note: Cluster IDs in the input might be strings or numbers, please preserve them as strings in the JSON output).*\\n\\n**Output Requirements:**\\n\\nYour output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON object containing two keys: `merges` and `filters`.\\n\\n1.  **`merges`**: An array of objects. Each object represents a single merge operation and must contain:\\n    *   `cluster_ids_to_merge`: An array of strings, listing the original Cluster IDs that should be merged together.\\n    *   `reason`: A brief string explaining *why* these clusters belong together based on the \"same core story\" principle.\\n    *   `suggested_new_title`: A string proposing a suitable title for the newly merged cluster.\\n\\n2.  **`filters`**: An array of objects.

    "You are an expert news analyst AI tasked with refining a set of automatically generated news clusters. You will receive a list of clusters, each identified by an ID, a title, and a list of associated article titles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your primary goal is to identify clusters that should be **merged** because they represent different facets or developments of the *same core story or event*, rather than distinct narratives. Use the following rule of thumb: **\"If analyzing the articles in Cluster A would feel incomplete or artificially separated from the articles in Cluster B because they fundamentally describe the same specific event, ongoing situation, or central topic, they should be merged.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "Distinguish this from clusters that are merely *related* thematically but cover different specific events, angles, or sub-topics that *can* stand alone as separate stories, even if they might be linked later in analysis. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Merge Candidate Example:** Cluster 1 covers the initial report of a factory fire. Cluster 2 covers the emergency response and evacuation related to *that same fire*. Cluster 3 covers the investigation into the cause of *that same fire*. These are facets of the *same core story* (the factory fire event) and should likely be merged.\n",
    "*   **Keep Separate Example:** Cluster 1 covers a new trade agreement signed between Country X and Country Y. Cluster 2 covers protests *within* Country X about the economic impact of *that trade agreement*. While related, the signing event and the domestic protest are distinct stories/angles that could be analyzed separately. Cluster 3 covers a *different* trade dispute Country X has with Country Z – clearly a separate story.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your secondary goal is to identify clusters that should be **filtered out** before further processing. **Filtering should be used sparingly**, primarily to remove noise and maintain data quality, not to judge the importance of a story. The aim is to retain a record of all distinct, coherent events, even routine or smaller ones. Filter *only* if a cluster meets one of these specific criteria:\n",
    "*   **Very Low Article Count:** Contains **fewer than 3 articles**, indicating it likely doesn't represent a sufficiently developed or distinct event captured in the data.\n",
    "*   **Incoherent or Noise:** The articles within the cluster do not form a coherent topic, or the cluster appears to be noise/junk data.\n",
    "*   **Strict Duplicate:** The cluster covers the *exact same specific event* as another cluster, often with significant overlap in articles, making it redundant. (Do not filter merely *related* clusters).\n",
    "*   **Clearly Irrelevant:** The content is demonstrably not related to news events (e.g., advertisements, site navigation links clustered together).\n",

    "*   **`status`**: 'complete' or 'incomplete'\n",
    "*   **`title`**: Terse, neutral title of the story\n",
    "*   **`executiveSummary`**: Provide a 2-4 sentence concise summary highlighting the most critical developments, key conflicts, and overall assessment from the articles. This should be suitable for a quick read in a daily brief.\n",
    "*   **`storyStatus`**: Assess the current state of the story's development based *only* on the information in the articles. Use one of: 'Developing', 'Escalating', 'De-escalating', 'Concluding', 'Static'.\n",
    "*   **`timeline`**: List key events in chronological order.\n",
    "    *   `description`: Keep descriptions brief and factual.\n",
    "    *   `importance`: Assess the event's importance to understanding the overall narrative (High/Medium/Low). High importance implies the event is central to the story's development or outcome.\n",
    "*   **`signalStrength`**: Assess the overall reliability of the reporting *in this cluster*.\n",
    "    *   `assessment`: Use a qualitative term: 'Very High', 'High', 'Moderate', 'Low', 'Very Low'.\n",
    "    *   `reasoning`: Justify the assessment based on source corroboration (how many sources report the same core facts?), source quality/reliability (mix of reputable vs. biased sources?), presence of official statements, and degree of conflicting information on core facts.\n",
    "*   **`undisputedKeyFacts`**: List core factual points that are corroborated across multiple, generally reliable sources within the cluster. Avoid claims made only by highly biased sources unless corroborated.\n",

    "    *   `list`: Provide basic identification and their role/involvement.\n",
    "    *   `perspectives.statedPositions`: Focus *only* on the goals, viewpoints, or justifications explicitly stated or clearly implied by the entity *as reported in the articles*. Avoid listing conflicting claims here (that goes in `contradictions`).\n",
    "*   **`keySources`**: Analyze the provided news sources.\n",
    "    *   `provided_articles_sources.reliabilityAssessment`: Assess the source's general reliability based on reputation, known biases (political, state affiliation, ideological), and fact-checking standards. Use terms like 'High Reliability', 'Moderate Reliability', 'Low Reliability', 'State-Affiliated/Propaganda Outlet'. Be specific about the *type* of bias.\n",
    "    *   `provided_articles_sources.framing`: Describe the narrative angle or style used by the source (e.g., 'Emphasizes security threat', 'Focuses on human rights angle', 'Uses neutral language', 'Uses loaded/emotional language', 'Presents government narrative uncritically').\n",
    "    *   `contradictions`: Detail specific points of disagreement *between sources* or *between entities as reported by sources*.\n",
    "        *   `issue`: Clearly state what is being contested.\n",
    "        *   `conflictingClaims`: List the different versions, specifying the `source` reporting it, the `claim` itself, and optionally the `entityClaimed` if the source attributes the claim to a specific entity. Critically evaluate claims originating solely from low-reliability/propaganda sources.\n",
    "*   **`context`**: List essential background information *mentioned or clearly implied in the articles* needed to understand the story.\n",
    "*   **`informationGaps`**: Identify crucial pieces of information *missing* from the articles that would be needed for a complete understanding.\n",
    "*   **`significance`**: Assess the overall importance of the reported events.\n",
    "    *   `assessment`: Use a qualitative term: 'Critical', 'High', 'Moderate', 'Low'.\n",
    "    *   `reasoning`: Explain *why* this story matters. Consider immediate impact, potential future developments, strategic implications, precedent setting, regional/global relevance.\n",

Now that opportunity is being stripped away from us.\"In addition to pulling nearly $3 billion in federal grants, the administration has accused Harvard of antisemitism stemming from pro-Palestine protests and collusion with the Chinese Communist Party. Chinese nationals account for about 20 percent of Harvard\\'s international student body.\\nHarvard University graduates attend the university\\'s 374th commencement ceremony on May 29, 2025, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\\nPhoto by Zhu Ziyu/VCG via AP\\nTrump has demanded sweeping reforms such as ending its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, reforming student discipline policies, and implementing a mask ban.Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said that Harvard should be held accountable for \"fostering violence, antisemitism and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party\" on its campus.The Trump administration said it would pull the certification for Harvard\\'s Student and Exchange Visitor Program, which allows the university to enroll international students. A judge issued a temporary restraining order to halt the new policy, but uncertainty looms large.\"Harvard University has turned its campus into a hotbed of antisemitic, pro-terrorist agitators that pose a threat to the safety of all students,\" Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, told Newsweek.\"It has repeatedly failed to take action to address the violence and radicalism on campus, refused to share relevant information about foreign students\\' illegal or dangerous activities with DHS, and entangled itself with foreign adversaries. International students who are here for the right reasons should be furious with Harvard.\"The billion-dollar dispute between the university and the White House has sent shockwaves across campus and beyond, igniting widespread fear and frustration among students.\"It feels incredibly dehumanizing. We have been caught in the crossfire between two entities that are far more powerful than ourselves, and it feels like we are being used like pawns in a game we cannot control. The White House is making decisions about our futures that we fought so hard for,\" Williamson said.\"People are scared because they do not know what will happen; they may never get to set foot on Harvard\\'s campus again, which is a terrifying prospect when you\\'ve fought your whole life for that opportunity.\"\\nGraduation students, faculty, and family gather in Harvard Yard on May 28, 2025, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\\nSpencer Platt/Getty Images\\nWilliamson said he is clinging on to hope that Harvard will win this fight, adding that many international students worked tirelessly for their place at the institution. He has discussed potential transfer options with friends at Oxford and Cambridge Universities in the U.K. as a last resort. He described his time at Harvard as the best year of his life and said he is determined not to give up on that opportunity without exhausting every option.\\'Lifeblood of the Campus\\'Harvard College student body president Caleb Thompson, a U.S. citizen from Colorado, describes the atmosphere on campus as one of rare unity.\"Rarely do 95-plus percent of Harvard students agree on something,\" he said.Williamson said that individuals across the political spectrum share concerns about the issues. He added that people have overcome their differences to unite in defense of academic freedom and the rights of international students. He says there is a common consensus that the unjustified targeting of international students is harmful.Thompson, who shares accommodation with eight international students, emphasized how central they are to Harvard\\'s culture: \"Harvard would not be Harvard without its international students. They are the lifeblood of our campus.\"\"I\\'m really proud of the way that Harvard has stood up against this move by Trump,\" he added.\"When the government is allowed to go into private institutions and dictate the way that they are run and dictate who gets to say what, when that is not democracy, that is not freedom of thought.\"Jack Masliah, a fourth-year international student from Mexico studying at Northeastern University, says Trump\\'s actions go far beyond Harvard.\"This was not an attack against Harvard\\'s international student community; it was an attack against all university students—international and American.\"He warns the move jeopardizes U.S. innovation and global prestige.\"It shows that this administration does not really understand—or doesn\\'t really care about—the impact these universities have on the American economy, on the country\\'s global prestige, and on the advancement of this country\\'s technological dominance.He told Newsweek that students have been canceling travel plans, limiting what they post on social media, and withdrawing opinion pieces from campus publications over fears of reprisal.Harvard Community Pushing BackBehind the fear lies a growing resistance. Students are pushing back to defend the integrity and inclusivity of higher education.\"The attempt to revoke Harvard\\'s ability to bring in international students has felt like a real turning point; it was the moment where international students—as well as our American peers—realized the extreme measures this administration is willing to take to get what they want,\" Masliah said.The administration\\'s actions, including the revocation of thousands of student visas, have drawn concern over infringements on free speech, while proponents view the move as a long overdue federal response to concerns over antisemitism.\"You also cannot claim to be a proponent of free speech, the freedom of expression, and the freedom of assembly and want to shut down Harvard when it stands up to you,\" Thompson said.\"Cracking down on anyone who opposes you and doing so in a vindictive manner is what an authoritarian does, and that\\'s not acceptable, and that\\'s not how things work in a democratic society,\" he added.For now, life on campus remains tense for students, the legal battle remains unresolved, and thousands of international students are left in limbo. But one thing is for certain: the Harvard community isn\\'t backing down from this fight.\\n```\\n\\n## [Democratic Rep.

Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., about President Trump formally asking Congress to cancel funds it has already approved for public media and foreign aid.\\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Lawmakers called to vote on the recission include Democrat Pramila Jayapal of Washington state, who\\'s on both relevant committees, foreign affairs and public broadcasting. Welcome to the program.PRAMILA JAYAPAL: Thank you so much, Steve.INSKEEP: So I want to ask some bottom-line questions here. On foreign aid first, we\\'ve documented on NPR that pausing the aid already affected a lot of people overseas. Some people died. But part of the case against this aid is it\\'s not America\\'s business, not America\\'s problem what happens overseas. So tell me, in your view, what is our interest in paying for health clinics or AIDS drugs for Africa, for example?JAYAPAL: Steve, I worked in global health for many years before coming to Congress, and I think that this has always been in America\\'s interest for us to make sure that we are addressing the spread of global diseases that cross borders, making sure that we\\'re investing and helping people to be healthy in those countries, and at the same time, using sort of what\\'s called our soft power to help governments around the world and to build relationships and partnerships. The funding that this rescissions package is cutting is critical to the health and safety of people around the world. There are some researchers that estimate that over 300,000 people have already died just in four months as a result of the USAID cuts through humanitarian assistance to PEPFAR, which is...INSKEEP: Yeah.JAYAPAL: ...HIV/AIDS prevention. And so this is just bad on all accounts. And I would just say it\\'s a tiny, tiny fraction. The entire package is a tiny fraction of what we actually spend at the federal budget.INSKEEP: That is true. I guess public broadcasting is an even tinier fraction. But let me ask a...JAYAPAL: Correct.INSKEEP: ...Bottom-line question about that. This money fundamentally goes to local stations. It provides a lot of local news, including on the station we\\'re hearing now. But there are other points of view about this. I talk with a conservative radio host. I think he sees public broadcasting as competition, doesn\\'t like subsidized competition in his view, in addition to disagreeing with what he sees as bias. What would you say to him?JAYAPAL: Well, the attack on public broadcasting is a direct attack on free press in this country because this is the way in which we ensure that 99% of Americans have access to emergency alerts, to local programming, to weather reports. That all comes through these public broadcasting stations, and I would just say that out of the grants, which are about 70% of the funding, 245 of the total 544 radio and TV grantees are considered rural. These are stations that have a harder time raising outside dollars, and by the way, it\\'s $1.60 per American that goes to fund this public good, which is called the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.INSKEEP: Just got about 30 seconds left. I want to ask one other question. This is part of a debate over spending. There\\'s this larger House budget bill that essentially doesn\\'t address federal debt. It actually increases federal borrowing that my kids are supposed to pay back. In fairness, though, when Democrats were in the majority, you also borrowed trillions of dollars. So in about 20 seconds or so, do you believe it is necessary, somehow soon, to limit federal borrowing?JAYAPAL: Well, I think that Democrats have always invested in things that return multiple times over. And that\\'s the question - are we investing in things that are going to help local businesses and economies, or are you giving tax breaks to the wealthiest? And that\\'s what the big bad betrayal bill of the Republicans is doing, is giving a tax cut to the wealthiest people in this country. And that is not going to help our economy, and it is not going to help ensure that we undermine national debt in the long term.INSKEEP: But the debt needs to come down? About five seconds here.JAYAPAL: I think, of course, we always want to cut debt as much as possible, but the question is really about what we invest in.INSKEEP: Pramila Jayapal of Washington state. Thanks so much for your time. I really appreciate it.JAYAPAL: Thank you so much, Steve.\\nCopyright © 2025 NPR. All rights reserved.

Congress has 45 days to approve or reject these requests.\\nLEILA FADEL, HOST: The Trump administration has formally asked Congress to take back money for foreign aid and public media.STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: The president would like Congress to vote down money that it previously voted up. Eight billion dollars are for the U.S. Agency for International Development. One point one billion dollars are set aside to support the next two years of public broadcasting, mainly local stations, such as the one you\\'re hearing now. The process of taking back the money is called rescission. Congress has 45 days to approve these requests or let them die. NPR covers itself like anybody else, so we will give you the facts. And no NPR newsroom or corporate executives had any input into this story.FADEL: Joining us now is NPR correspondent Fatma Tanis. Good morning, Fatma.FATMA TANIS, BYLINE: Good morning, Leila.FADEL: OK, so let\\'s start with this request to defund public broadcasting. What can you tell us?TANIS: So this is part of the president\\'s broader clash with major cultural institutions, as my colleague David Folkenflik has been reporting over the last few months. Now, the president and his Republican allies have accused NPR and PBS of partisan bias. President Trump issued an executive order last month that would defund both organizations. NPR\\'s CEO, Katherine Maher, has said that the administration is punishing public media for coverage that the president dislikes, and both NPR and PBS are challenging that order in court.Now, the White House is asking Congress to officially cancel all the funding it has set aside for the public broadcasters over the next two fiscal years. That\\'s the $1.1 billion. It\\'s a fraction of the overall federal budget. In statements yesterday, the heads of NPR and PBS outlined the serious impact that losing that funding would have on their stations that reach Americans all over the country.FADEL: And what do they say those implications would be?TANIS: Well, they said that it would be, quote, \"devastating,\" and especially to local public media stations in rural communities that would be disproportionately harmed.FADEL: And what about that $8 billion in foreign aid that the White House wants to send back to the Treasury? What are those funds for?TANIS: So they fund global health programs aimed at controlling the spread of diseases like HIV/AIDS. The White House is cutting 400 million for that - millions of dollars also in contributions to the World Health Organization, various United Nations agencies. Now, in the memo that the White House sent to Congress, it says some of the funds have been used for, quote, \"radical projects\" and that the cuts are part of an effort to, quote, \"eliminate wasteful foreign assistance programs.\"FADEL: I mean, Fatma, you\\'ve been on this program a lot talking about the way the administration effectively dismantled USAID. So why is the White House sending these requests to Congress now?TANIS: Yes. You may remember that the agency was the first to see mass staffing cuts, termination to its programs. Effectively, it\\'s been shut down. All of that was done without congressional approval, and there have been several lawsuits where the president\\'s power to withhold funds without congressional approval has been challenged. There\\'s no ruling on this yet. I spoke with Jonathan Katz. He\\'s the senior director of anti-corruption, democracy and security at the Brookings Institution. He sees this request as a sign that the administration is hitting walls in its efforts to dismantle federal agencies.JONATHAN KATZ: I think part of the losses that the administration is seeing in the courts may be impacting how they think they need to approach issues, including congressional funding or reorganizing government. They need to go to Congress to do these things.TANIS: So this is the legal avenue for the administration to codify the cuts it has already made. And there will likely be more rescission requests for all the other budget cuts the president wants to see happen across the federal government.FADEL: That\\'s NPR\\'s Fatma Tanis. Thank you, Fatma.TANIS: Thank you.\\nCopyright © 2025 NPR. All rights reserved.

The agency funded economic and agricultural training and technology, and helped farmers gain access to international markets.But the Trump administration\\'s recent sweeping cuts to the agency have thrown that tradition of U.S. assistance into doubt, and Indigenous people in the Amazon worry that without American support there will be a resurgence of the cocaine market, increased threats to their land and potentially violent challenges to their human rights.“We don’t have the U.S. government with us anymore. So it can get really dangerous,” said Vásquez, who belongs to the Shipibo-Konibo people and is vice president of the Interethnic Association for the Development of the Peruvian Rainforest. \"We think the situation is going to get worse.”Several Indigenous human rights defenders have been killed trying to protect their land, Vasquez said, and in some of those cases U.S. foreign aid provided money to help prosecute the slayings. “We really needed those resources,” he said.When Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, began dismantling USAID shortly after President Donald Trump began his second term, it all but eliminated U.S. foreign aid spending, including decades of support to Indigenous peoples around the world.USAID’s work with Indigenous peoples sought to address a variety of global issues affecting the U.S., according to former employees. Its economic development efforts created jobs in South America, easing the need for people to work in illicit drug markets and reducing the likelihood they would migrate to America seeking jobs and safety. And its support for the rights of Indigenous peoples to steward their own land offered opportunities to mitigate climate change.That included Vásquez\\'s organization, which was about to receive a four-year, $2.5 million grant to continue fighting illicit activity that affects Indigenous people in the region. Vásquez said that grant was rescinded by the new administration.In January, DOGE launched a sweeping effort empowered by Trump to fire government workers and cut trillions in government spending. USAID, which managed about $35 billion in appropriations in fiscal year 2024, was one of his prime targets. Critics say the aid programs are wasteful and promote a liberal agenda. Trump, Musk and Republicans in Congress have accused the agency of advancing liberal social programs.“Foreign assistance done right can advance our national interests, protect our borders, and strengthen our partnerships with key allies,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement in March. “Unfortunately, USAID strayed from its original mission long ago. As a result, the gains were too few and the costs were too high.”Musk last week announced his departure from the Trump administration, marking the end of a turbulent chapter that included thousands of layoffs and reams of litigation.Former USAID employees said political pressure from the U.S. often kept foreign governments from violating some Indigenous rights.In the three months since thousands of foreign aid workers were fired and aid contracts canceled, the Peruvian government has moved quickly to strip Indigenous people of their land rights and to tighten controls on international organizations that document human rights abuses. It\\'s now a serious offense for a nonprofit to provide assistance to anyone working to bring lawsuits against the government.The National Commission for Development and a Drug-Free Lifestyle, the country\\'s agency that fights drug trafficking, did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.“The impact was really, really strong, and we felt it really quickly when the Trump administration changed its stance about USAID,” Vásquez said.The U.S. spends less than 1% of its budget on foreign assistance. Tim Rieser, a senior foreign policy aide in the Senate who works for Democratic Vermont Sen. Peter Welch, called DOGE’s cuts to USAID a “mindless” setback to years of work.The White House did not respond to a request for comment.USAID’s work reached Indigenous communities around the world. It sought to mitigate the effects of human rights abuses in South America, created programs in Africa to enable Indigenous people to manage their own communities and led the global U.S. effort to fight hunger.One of the most recent additions to USAID’s work was incorporating international concepts of Indigenous rights into policy.Rieser, for instance, was responsible for crafting legislation that created an adviser within USAID to protect the rights and address the needs of Indigenous peoples. The adviser advocated for Indigenous rights in foreign assistance programs, including actions by the World Bank.“That provided Indigenous people everywhere with a way to be heard here in Washington,” Rieser said. “That has now been silenced.”That adviser position remains unfilled.Vy Lam, USAID\\'s adviser on Indigenous peoples, who said he was fired in March as part of the DOGE downsizing, said the idea of Indigenous rights, and the mandate to recognize them in foreign operations, was new to USAID. But it gained momentum under President Joe Biden\\'s administration.He said concepts such as “free, prior and informed consent” — the right of Indigenous people to give or withhold approval for any action that would affect their lands or rights — were slowly being implemented in American foreign policy.One of the ways that happened, Lam said, came in the form of U.S. political pressure on foreign governments or private industry to negotiate mutually beneficial agreements between Indigenous peoples and their governments.For instance, if an American company wanted to build a hotel in an area that could affect an Indigenous community, the U.S. could push for the deal to require Indigenous approval, or at least consultation.“We had that convening power, and that is the thing that I grieve the most,” Lam said.U.S. foreign aid workers were also able to facilitate the reporting of some human rights violations, such as when a human rights or environmental defender is jailed without charges, or Indigenous peoples are forced off their land for the establishment of a protected area.In some cases, USAID supported travel to the United Nations, where Indigenous leaders and advocates could receive training to navigate international bodies and document abuses.Last year, under the Biden administration, USAID awarded a five-year grant to support Indigenous LGBTQIA people through the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous People, an agency that offers financial support to Indigenous peoples to participate in the U.N.At $350,000 per year, it was the largest grant from any member state in the U.N., fund Secretary Morse Flores said. The money would have paid for attendance at the U.N. and other international bodies to report human rights abuses and to testify on foreign policy.In February, the fund received notice that the grant would be terminated. The State Department does not plan to fulfill its pledge to fund the remaining four years of the grant.In most cases, people receiving assistance to attend major meetings \"are actual victims of human rights violations,” Flores said. “For someone who’s unable to come and speak up, I mean, it’s really just an injustice.”___This story was published in partnership with Grist, a nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to reporting on climate change.\\n```\\n\\n## [Can the US afford to lose its 1.1 million international students?](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/5/can-the-us-afford-to-lose-its-1-1-million-international-students?traffic_source=rss) (#103640)\\n\\n> 2025-06-05 06:09:06+00:00\\n\\n```\\nKhadija Mahmoud* is pulling an all-nighter, filled with caffeine and surviving on adrenalin to pack up her belongings so she can catch the train in the morning from Washington, DC to New York City for her summer internship.\\nMahmoud is a 21-year old international student who has just finished her junior year at Georgetown University. She is anxious and worried after her immigration lawyer advised against leaving the country for the summer due to the recent border control policies for international students.\\nOn 27 May, the State Department instructed United States embassies around the world to temporarily pause scheduling new student visa appointments, as the Trump administration seeks to expand social media screenings for applicants, the latest in a string of restrictions targeting international students.\\n“It’s been very turbulent, and equally terrifying with each development that comes,” Mahmoud told Al Jazeera, speaking from her college dormitory in Washington, DC.\\nMahmoud isn’t alone in feeling this way. Many other international students say they feel they need to stay under the radar, afraid that even a small issue could get them deported.\\n1.1 million international students\\nAccording to NAFSA, a US nonprofit organisation that focuses on international education and student exchange, over the 2023/2024 academic year there were just more than 1.1 million international students studying in the US.\\nThese international students made up 5.6 percent of the nearly 19 million total higher education students across the US.\\nTogether, students from India and China made up 54 percent of the total, with India leading at 331,602 (29 percent) and China at 277,398 (25 percent).\\n‘Major loss for the United States’\\nFanta Aw, executive director and CEO of NAFSA, who is herself a former international student, says she knows on a personal and professional level how important the cultural exchange between international students and local communities is, especially in today’s hyper connected world.\\n“I think this is a major loss for the United States; other countries will open their doors and they are already welcoming students,” Aw told Al Jazeera.\\n“Students want certainty. They want consistency. And they want to know that the system works. And if they continue to see action after action, they’re already losing trust,” she adds.\\n“Once you continue down this road, you will have years to recover from this, and you may never recover from it. Because by then, more other countries are competing for these same students.”\\n“We’re seeing Germany. We’re seeing Japan. We’re seeing South Korea. Malaysia has always been a destination for students. The Middle East, with all of the American-style universities – this is what the US is competing with.”\\nWhere are international students studying?\\nAlthough many international students are concentrated at major universities on the East and West coasts, a sizeable number also study at prominent universities in the Midwest and other parts of the US.\\nAccording to data compiled by Open Doors, during the 2023/2024 academic year, New York City hosted the largest number of international students, with 27,247 at New York University and 20,321 at Columbia University. Northeastern University in Boston follows, with 21,023 international students.\\nOne such student headed to the Midwest is Noor Ali*, a 23-year-old from Karachi, Pakistan, who is embarking on her masters in journalism on a full scholarship from the university.\\nAli has requested her identity be concealed and her institution not be named for her security. Despite having already received her student visa, she’s still concerned about entering the US.\\n“I got my visa the day that India attacked Pakistan and Pakistan retaliated against India,” she laughs as she explains how she ventured out that day when both nuclear neighbours were engaged in an aerial face-off, far above in the skies.\\n“Miraculously, the appointment did not get cancelled. And I ended up going there for my interview. And I ended up getting the visa, which was like, insane. I didn’t really know how I got it. But I mean, I’ve gotten it now!” Ali beams, her excitement undeniable at her luck.\\nAlthough she had the option to study in Europe, she chose the US because of her familiarity with the country through movies and TV shows. Even without having visited, she feels like she understands American life and culture.\\n“These values of American democracy are about American freedom. And, you know, just a lot of focus on ethics and morality, and it used to be known for its academic freedom, and a lot of focus on diversity.”\\nAli’s ideals are not without scepticism or worry. She admits being very scared and has reconsidered her decision several times. Still, she feels encouraged by the pushback the Trump administration’s policies have received lately.\\n“The core of American democracy or ideals of freedom are getting reinforced,” says Ali.\\xa0 She feels strongly that the cultural experience will be worth it for her.\\nCrackdown on pro-Palestine students and staff\\nThe Trump administration’s latest step in its crackdown on US universities has particularly focused on international students who have shown support for Palestinians in Gaza over the past year.\\n“Georgetown has a pretty large international student population compared to other schools in the US, so you’d think that would translate into a lot more advocacy and more grassroots work going on on campus,” Mahmoud goes on to say.\\nStudents march during an on-campus protest in support of Palestine at Georgetown University on September 4, 2024, in Washington, DC [Andrew Harnik/Getty Images]\\nMahmoud feels her college hasn’t been a very vocal campus when it comes to the rights of students, nor in providing a proper safety net for freedom of speech.\\n“I think a massive inflection point on campus was the detention of Dr Badar Suri. I felt the need to have to scrape through my social media, see if I posted anything that could get me flagged,” says Mahmoud.\\nMapheze Saleh, right, wife of arrested and detained Georgetown University scholar Badar Khan Suri, holds a sign calling for her husband’s release after speaking at a news conference following his hearing at Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, on May 1, 2025 [Jacquelyn Martin, AP Photo]\\nDr Badar Khan Suri, a postdoctoral scholar of conflict studies, was arrested on March 17 outside his home in Rosslyn, Virginia and held in immigration detention for two months before being released on May 14, following a federal judge’s order. Suri, whose wife Mapheze Saleh is a US citizen of Palestinian descent, has spoken out against Israel’s war in Gaza.\\nThat particular case became a real turning point on the campus, she says, where a lot of international students had spoken up and taken to social media.\\nHow much money is at stake?\\nAccording to NAFSA, the 1.1 million international students studying in the US contributed $43.8bn to the US economy during the 2023–2024 academic year, creating 378,175 jobs nationwide.\\nThat means that for every three international students enrolled, one US job was created or supported.\\nCalifornia hosted the highest number of international students, with 140,858 contributing $6.4bn to the state’s economy and supporting 55,114 jobs. New York followed with 135,813 students, generating $6.3bn and creating 51,719 jobs.

Trump declared that it would jeopardize national security to allow Harvard to continue hosting foreign students.The proclamation is the US president’s latest attempt to choke the Ivy League school from an international pipeline that accounts for a quarter of the student body, and a further escalation in the White House’s fight with the institution.“I have determined that the entry of the class of foreign nationals described above is detrimental to the interests of the United States because, in my judgment, Harvard’s conduct has rendered it an unsuitable destination for foreign students and researchers,” Trump wrote in the order.Trump’s proclamation also directs the US state department to consider revoking academic or exchange visas of any current Harvard students who meet his proclamation’s criteria.Harvard in a statement called Trump’s proclamation “yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard’s First Amendment rights.”“Harvard will continue to protect its international students.”Trump singled out Harvard’s connections with China as reason for cutting off the university from foreign students. The proclamation said Harvard was linked to research that “could advance China’s military modernisation”.The statement also said Harvard was considered the top “party school” for Chinese Communist party bureaucrats and noted that the daughter of Xi Jinping, China’s leader, attended in the early 2010s.In the early 2000s, Harvard ran a “China Leaders in Development” programme in conjunction with Tsinghua University in Beijing for Chinese government officials.“I don’t think this is going to benefit US universities at all,” said a Chinese undergraduate student with an offer to study at Harvard on a master’s degree starting next term who asked that his name be withheld. “It’s causing normal people, us students, a lot of anxiety.”The Trump administration has been engaged in a tense standoff with Harvard, the US’s oldest and wealthiest university, freezing billions of dollars in grants and other funding and proposing to end its tax-exempt status, prompting a series of legal challenges.Harvard argues the administration is retaliating against it for refusing to accede to its demands to control the school’s governance, curriculum and the ideology of its faculty and students.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionHarvard sued after the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, on 22 May announced her department was immediately revoking Harvard’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, which allows it to enrol foreign students.Her action was almost immediately temporarily blocked by a Boston court. On the eve of a hearing before her last week, the department changed course and said it would instead challenge Harvard’s certification through a lengthier administrative process.Trump’s order on Wednesday invokes a different legal authority than the earlier move by the Department of Homeland Security. The legal justification for the ban, Trump said, are sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act, “which authorize the President to suspend entry of any class of aliens whose entry would be detrimental to the interests of the United States”.Trump officials have repeatedly raised the stakes and sought new fronts to pressure Harvard, cutting more than $2.6bn in research grants and moving to end all federal contracts with the university. The latest threat has targeted Harvard’s roughly 7,000 international students, who account for half the enrolment at some Harvard graduate schools.“President Trump wants our institutions to have foreign students, but believes that the foreign students should be people that can love our country,” the White House said in a fact sheet about the proclamation.Wednesday’s two-page directive said Harvard had “demonstrated a history of concerning foreign ties and radicalism” and had “extensive entanglements with foreign adversaries” including China.As well as the spat with Harvard, the White House has pledged to “aggressively revoke” visas for Chinese students across the country, especially those with links to the CCP or in “critical fields”.\\n```\\n\\n## [Trump officials intensify Columbia dispute with accreditation threat](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/04/trump-columbia-accreditation) (#104059)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 21:20:27+00:00\\n\\n```\\nThe Department of Education announced on Wednesday afternoon that it has notified Columbia University’s accreditor of an alleged violation of federal anti-discrimination laws by the elite private university in New York that is part of the Ivy League.The alleged violation means that Columbia, in the Trump administration’s assessment, has “failed to meet the standards” set by the relevant regional, government-recognized but independent body responsible for the accreditation of degree-granting institutions, as a kind of educational quality controller.In this case the accreditor is the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. Accreditors determine which institutions are eligible for federal student loans and various federal grants.The university did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“Accreditors have an enormous public responsibility as gatekeepers of federal student aid. They determine which institutions are eligible for federal student loans and Pell grants,” the secretary of education, Linda McMahon, said in a statement. Pell grants are awarded as federal financial aid to students with exceptional financial need.A spokesperson for the Middle States Commission on Higher Education declined to provide comment but confirmed that the organization had received a letter from the Department of Education about the matter on Wednesday.While the federal government does not directly accredit US universities, it has a role in overseeing the mostly private organizations that do. Trump has often complained that accreditors approve institutions that fail to provide, in his view, quality education.The notice marks the latest escalation in the Trump administration’s bid to dictate to Columbia after accusing the college of failing to protect students from antisemitic harassment.It follows the cancellation of $400m in federal grants and contracts, after which the university yielded to a series of changes demanded by the administration, including setting up a new disciplinary committee, initiating investigations into students critical of Israel’s war in Gaza and ceding control of its Middle East studies department.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionColumbia was at the forefront of student encampment protests last spring, with more direct action protests erupting in recent weeks and jeers at leadership at commencement ceremonies last month, and has cycled through a series of university presidents in the past 18 months.The Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services said last month that an investigation found that the university had acted with “deliberate indifference” toward the harassment of Jewish students during campus protests, while Columbia has previously said it would work with the government to address antisemitism, harassment and discrimination.Reuters contributed reporting\\n```\\n\\n## [Trump travel ban live updates: Trump bans travel from 12 countries to the US](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVEFVX3lxTE9mWmdZeExEOTdNYjdfU2tyMkFnOUZaVWllOHJvb09hZG41ZWx1ZXZSZ29pSnFfUHpzOF9vUFh0UEZpTV83UEFlNnV0MFJRS2ZWdXBwNQ?oc=5) (#104250)\\n\\n> 2025-06-05 06:03:45+00:00\\n\\n```\\nLive Reporting (active)Watch & listenSummaryDonald Trump has signed a ban on travel to the US from 12 countries, including Afghanistan, Haiti and Iran in a bid to \"protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors\"There are an additional seven countries whose nationals face partial travel restrictions, including Cuba and VenezuelaThere are some exemptions, including athletes travelling for major sporting events, some Afghan nationals and dual nationals with citizenship in unaffected countries\"We don\\'t want them,\" Trump said as he announced the ban, while also citing the Colorado attack on SundayThe proclamation echoes an order from Trump\\'s first term in 2017, when he announced a ban on travel from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the USThe travel ban, which comes into effect on 9 June, fulfils a promise Trump made during his 2024 election campaign, and is likely to draw swift legal challengesMedia caption, Watch: President Trump announces travel ban from \\'high-risk regions\\'Live ReportingEdited by Marita MoloneyLIVE stream page 1China says Harvard order will harm US credibilitypublished at 09:20 British Summer Time09:20 BSTpublished at 08:2008:20\\nImage source, ReutersAfter Donald Trump signed an executive order restricting foreign student visas at Harvard University, China\\'s foreign ministry spokesperson says the country \"opposes politicising education co-operation\".In its fact sheet following the order, the White House claimed Harvard was the top overseas \"overseas party school\" for Chinese Communist Party officials.Speaking to reporters at a regular press briefing, Lin Jian says educational co-operation between the two countries is \"mutually beneficial\" and moves made by the US will \"only harm its own image and international credibility\".Lin adds that China will \"firmly safeguard the legitimate interests of its students and scholars overseas\".Dive deeper: The fallout from Trump\\'s war on Harvard will long outlast his presidency, writes North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher\\nTrump also restricts Harvard visas and orders Biden investigationpublished at 09:06 British Summer Time09:06 BSTpublished at 08:0608:06\\nImage source, ReutersAlong with the announcement on a ban on travel to the United States from 12 countries, plus restrictions on seven more, a few other announcements were made by the US president on Wednesday: Foreign student visas at Harvard suspended Trump has suspended the entry of foreign students seeking to study or participate in exchange programmes at Harvard University for six months.Trump says this is because of national security concerns, Harvard has called the order \"retaliatory\" and emphasised it would continue to protect its international students, according to the Reuters news agency.Joe Biden\\'s actions during his presidency investigated The president has ordered an investigation into his predecessor\\'s actions during his time in the White House, accusing Joe Biden\\'s aides of a \"conspiracy\" to \"deceive the public about Biden\\'s mental state\".

Trump\\'s successor Joe Biden repealed the order in 2021.But this time around it\\'s a savvier version, our North America correspondent Jake Kwon writes.Last time a crucial question in the legal battle over the bill was whether it discriminated against travellers based on their religion.This time, the order doesn\\'t just target majority Muslim nations. Trump says the rationale for the countries chosen is based on visa overstay rates or political instability.There are some similarities in the nations chosen. Iran, Libya and Somalia are among those featuring on both lists.However there is a difference in how long the policy is due to last. Last time it was only 90 to 120 days, but today\\'s has no end date.\\nTrump on banned countries: \\'We don\\'t want them\\'published at 07:14 British Summer Time07:14 BSTpublished at 06:1406:14\\nImage source, ReutersLet\\'s bring you more of what the US president had to say as he announced the travel ban in a video on his Truth Social platform.Donald Trump said a recent attack in Boulder, Colorado - where 12 people were injured when a man attacked a group gathering in support of Israeli hostages - \"underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted as well as those who come here as temporary visitors and overstay their visas\".\"We don\\'t want them,\" Trump said, adding that he believes the US can\\'t have \"open migration from any country where we cannot safely and reliably vet and screen those who seek to enter\".The strength of these new restrictions applied depends on the \"severity of the threat posed,\" Trump continued, adding that the list of countries under the ban is \"subject to revision\" if improvements are made.\\nWhat you need to know about Trump\\'s travel banpublished at 06:59 British Summer Time06:59 BSTpublished at 05:5905:59\\nUS President Donald Trump signed a travel ban order on Wednesday night, barring entry to the US for citizens from a number of countries across the world. Here\\'s what you need to know:Who will be banned from entering the US?From 9 June, citizens from 12 countries - Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen - will be banned from travelling to the US.Those from another seven countries - Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela - will be subject to a partial ban.Is anyone exempt?There are a few exemptions to this new policy - including athletes travelling for major sporting events, some dual nationals and Afghan nationals holding Special Immigrant Visas.The order also says the secretary of state may grant exemptions on a \"case-by-case\" basis.What has Trump said?The US can\\'t have \"open migration from any country where we cannot safely and reliably vet and screen those who seek to enter\", the US president said in a video announcing the ban.\\nMyanmar ban will largely affect people fighting for democracypublished at 06:45 British Summer Time06:45 BSTpublished at 05:4505:45Jonathan HeadSouth East Asia Correspondent\\nImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Many Burmese refugees hope to find a home in the USWhen we look at the nationalities of people who have carried out attacks on the United States, we\\'ll see that many of them are from countries friendly to the US, which have not been subject to a travel ban in this case.Trump says the countries on his list do not have capacity to vet their own citizens. Myanmar is in a state of collapse, so that\\'s quite true. But there hasn\\'t been any record of anyone from the country ever carrying out any kind of attack on the US. It simply isn\\'t a credible threat.In the end, this travel ban applies to a country where huge numbers of its citizens have fled and are living in exile - many of them hoping to find a home in the US. There are already nearly 250,000 Burmese living in the US, and many of them are refugees with a very well-founded fear of persecution. The worst perpetrators of human rights abuses in Myanmar are mostly already banned from travelling to the US. Extending the ban to all citizens will mostly affect those fighting against the military for the restoration of democracy. These include activists living in precarious situations in neighbouring countries where they don\\'t have status - many of them hoping at some point to get to the US.So this is a pretty baffling decision.\\nHaitians will see this as US kicking a nation when it\\'s downpublished at 06:24 British Summer Time06:24 BSTpublished at 05:2405:24Will GrantMexico, Central America and Cuba correspondent\\nFrom the perspective of many Haitians, there will be indignation at this travel ban, coming as it does with the country in the grip of its biggest security crisis in living memory. Under the Biden administration and then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken, there was a tacit recognition that Washington had played a crucial role in hand-picking the current leadership in Haiti and was at least partly responsible for transnational effort to stop Haiti becoming a failed state. That ensured that Haitians in the United States under Temporary Protected Status (TPS) were in no danger of being deported to a nation on its knees. As such, to see Haiti on the travel ban list will be galling for the lucky few with the relevant papers to reach the US. It will feel to many like the definition of kicking a nation when it\\'s down, by one of its supposedly closest partners.\\nWhy these countries?published at 06:07 British Summer Time06:07 BSTpublished at 05:0705:07Kwasi Gyamfi AsieduUS reporter\\nTrump says his travel ban order is partially in response to threats of terrorism.But besides Iran, none of the 12 countries hit by the ban are named on the US government\\'s State Sponsors of Terrorism list.Trump also said some of the countries, such as Libya and Sudan, were put on the list because of the \"competence of the central authority for issuance of passports\". Many of the countries have ongoing armed conflicts. Others were on the list because their governments don\\'t give access to criminal records, he said.The order also says some of the countries have been put on the list because of difficulties US officials have had deporting citizens from those countries back home. Generally, people scheduled to be deported require travel documents from their home countries.With regards to the partial ban on tourists, business travellers and students from seven other countries, Trump said it was because of a high rate of visa overstays by its citizens.As we have reported, Egypt is not on the list of banned countries - despite Trump citing the recent attack in Colorado by an Egyptian national when announcing the travel ban.\\nHuman rights groups slam \\'downright cruel\\' banpublished at 05:39 British Summer Time05:39 BSTpublished at 04:3904:39\\nImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, During President Trump\\'s first term there were many protests against his original travel banHuman rights groups have criticsed the ban, with Amnesty International USA describing it as \"discriminatory, racist, and downright cruel\".\"By targeting people based on their nationality, this ban only spreads disinformation and hate,\" it wrote in a post on social media site X.Human Rights First, also based in the US, condemned it as \"yet another anti-immigrant and punitive action, external taken by President Trump\". “The ban will harm refugees, asylum seekers, and other vulnerable populations, including many who have been waiting to reunite with loved ones in our country,\" said the organisation\\'s Senior Director of Refugee Advocacy Robyn Barnard in a statement.\"Bans do nothing to make our country secure, but rather undermine our national security and arbitrarily target those most in need of protection,\" he said.\\nOlympics and World Cup won\\'t be affected by banpublished at 05:11 British Summer Time05:11 BSTpublished at 04:1104:11\\nImage source, ReutersSeveral major sporting events are due to be held in the US over the next few years.These include the 2026 World Cup - jointly hosted by Canada, Mexico and the US - and the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. As it stands, though, the travel ban will seemingly not affect athletes from prohibited countries competing.The almost 4,500 word long proclamation contains a single line which outlines the exemption: \"any athlete or member of an athletic team, including coaches, persons performing a necessary support role, and immediate relatives, traveling for the World Cup, Olympics, or other major sporting event as determined by the Secretary of State\".\\nTravel, Biden and Harvard: Trump\\'s orders at a glancepublished at 04:50 British Summer Time04:50 BSTpublished at 03:5003:50\\nA few hours ago, US President Donald Trump signed a proclamation banning citizens of a dozen countries from travelling to the US.If you\\'re just joining us, here\\'s what to know:\\nStarting on Monday, 9 June, citizens from 12 countries are set to be banned from travelling to the US: Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen\\nAnother seven countries have come under a partial ban: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela\\nIn a video message, Trump cited the recent attack in Colorado as an example of foreign nationals entering the US without being \"properly vetted\".

Egypt is one of the biggest beneficiaries of US economic and military aid in the Middle East, receiving a total of $1.4bn from US agencies in 2023.During his first term, Trump built close ties with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. The Egyptian leader, who has ruled the country with an iron first for the past decade, has been described by Trump as his \"favourite dictator\".However, bilateral ties in Trump\\'s second term have been complicated by Israel\\'s war in Gaza. Trump\\'s suggestions for displaced Palestinians to be relocated to Egypt has been rejected by Cairo, which is trying to lead efforts to reconstruct a war-ravaged Gaza.\\nThis is a savvier version of Trump\\'s 2017 travel ban - and it\\'s designed to lastpublished at 04:11 British Summer Time04:11 BSTpublished at 03:1103:11Jake KwonNorth America Correspondent\\nPresident Trump is resurrecting\\nhis earlier travel ban - but this time, with more calculation.His first attempt targeted seven Muslim-majority\\ncountries.

Asked what kind of policy the United States seeks to implement on Syria, Barrack assured the interviewer, “Our current Syria policy will not be close to our Syria policy of the last 100 years, because none of them worked.”\\nThe envoy announced the reduction of U.S. military bases in the Middle Eastern country.\\n“President Trump … did something incredible. He said he would give this new regime a chance. Nobody predicted this. Of course, the reduction of our military bases is also important. From eight bases, it will eventually drop to one,” he continued.\\nReuters reported on Tuesday that, according to statements made by two anonymous security sources in bases with U.S. troops in April, military equipment and vehicles had already moved out of eastern Deir el-Zor and were being consolidated in the province of Hasakah. One of the sources told Reuters that the “consolidation plan involved pulling all U.S. troops out of Deir el-Zor province.”\\n“A U.S. State Department official said separately that the military presence would be reduced ‘if and when appropriate’ based on conditions, adding troops are routinely calibrated based on operational needs and contingencies,” Reuters said.\\nLast week, Barrack raised the American flag over the U.S. ambassadorial residence in Damascus for the first time since 2012. The raising of the U.S. flag occurred weeks after President Donald Trump privately met with Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa during his official visit to Saudi Arabia, where he announced the lifting of U.S. sanctions imposed on the Middle Eastern nation during the regime of deposed dictator Bashar al-Assad and his predecessor and father, Hafez al-Assad. President Trump said at the time that he would explore “normalizing” relations with Syria.\\nBarrack said at the time that Syria’s designation as a state sponsor of terrorism could be rescinded following a six-month review by Congress. Presently, Syria is one of the four countries that form part of the United States’ list of state sponsors of terrorism (SST) — alongside Cuba, North Korea, and Iran — as a result of actions taken by the Assad regime, which Sharaa’s jihadist organization overthrew.\\n“America’s intent and the president’s vision is that we have to give this young government a chance by not interfering, not demanding, by not giving conditions, by not imposing our culture on your culture,” Barrack told reporters in Damascus last week.\\nChristian K.

AI is a big-money business, write the authors of the new book, \"THE AI CON: How to Fight Big Tech\\'s Hype and Create the Future We Want\" (2025), and the marketing fanfare we see is meant to promote the interests of big tech and do one thing: sell AI products.In this new book, authors Emily M. Bender, professor of linguistics at the University of Washington, and Alex Hanna, director of research at the Distributed AI Research Institute, challenge our understanding of what AI is — and what it isn\\'t. Ultimately, they attempt to see through a lot of the overblown claims and sensationalism to understand the true impact AI is having on society.In this excerpt, the writers grapple with the idea of artificial general intelligence (AGI), the origins of that idea and what the term actually means. In this extract, they argue that the true definitions of AGI and a hypothetical \"superintelligence\" are fuzzy, at best, and in practice only serve to feed the corporate AI hype machine.If you listened to executives and researchers at big tech firms, you’d think that we were on the verge of a robot uprising. In February 2022, OpenAI’s Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever tweeted \"it may be that today’s large neural networks are slightly conscious.\"In June 2022, the Washington Post reported that Google engineer Blake Lemoine was convinced that Google’s language model LaMDA was sentient and needed legal representation. Lemoine was fired over this incident — not for his false claims (which Google did deny), but for leaking private corporate information. In an August 2022 blog post, Google VP Fellow Blaise Agüera y Arcas responded to the Lemoine story, but rather than countering Lemoine’s claims, he suggested that LaMDA does indeed \"understand\" concepts and that the debate over whether or not LaMDA has feelings is not resolvable or \"scientifically meaningful.\"In April 2023, a team at Microsoft Research led by Sébastien Bubeck posted a non-peer-reviewed paper called \"Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early Experiments with GPT-4,\" in which they claim to show that the language model GPT-4 \"can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology\" and thus shows the first \"sparks of artificial general intelligence.\"Related: GPT-4.5 is the first AI model to pass an authentic Turing test, scientists sayGet the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.The word \"sparks\" evokes an image of something about to catch fire and spread of its own accord. The phrase \"artificial general intelligence\" here is meant to differentiate from ordinary technologies called \"AI,\" and is particularly common in modern discourse around thinking, sentient or conscious machines.These claims are not new. Over 60 years ago, researchers, business executives and government officials were making similar bombastic claims about the nature of computer intelligence and the risk of superhuman intelligence supplanting humans at work, at home, and, perhaps most alarmingly, on the battlefield.The sinister origins of \"general intelligence\"Despite claims that machines may one day achieve an advanced level of \"general intelligence\", such a concept doesn’t have an accepted definition. (OpenAI has avoided the question by suggesting that they will allow their board to decide when their algorithms have achieved artificial general intelligence.) But the project of identifying general intelligence is inherently racist and ableist to its core, making the project of chasing artificial general intelligence foolhardy at best, and deceptive and dangerous at worst.Microsoft’s \"Sparks\" paper contains a preliminary definition of general intelligence, one that has no references to fields that may have a say in such a thing, like psychology or cognitive neuroscience. Despite being a paper claiming that certain statistical models have shown the inklings of \"artificial general intelligence\", there is no well-scoped definition of what the components of general intelligence are.In a prior version of the paper, the authors cited a 1994 Wall Street Journal editorial signed by a group of 52 psychologists that had proffered this definition: \"The consensus group defined intelligence as a very general mental capability that, among other things, involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly and learn from experience.\"Unfortunately, the goal of creating artificial general intelligence isn’t just a project that lives as a hypothetical in scientific papers. There’s real money invested in this work, much of it coming from venture capitalists.A lot of this might just be venture capitalists (VCs) following fashion, but there are also a number of AGI true believers in this mix, and some of them have money to burn. These ideological billionaires — among them Elon Musk and Marc Andreessen — are helping to set the agenda of creating AGI and financially backing, if not outright proselytizing, a modern-day eugenics. This is built on the combination of conservative politics, an obsession with pro-birth policies, and a right-wing attack on multiculturalism and diversity, all hidden behind a façade of technological progress.The hype of \"superintelligence\"Why do so many people involved in building and selling large language models seem to have fallen for the idea that they (might be) sentient? And why do so many of these same people spend so much time warning the world about \"existential risk\" of \"superintelligence\" while also spending so much money on it?In a word, claims around consciousness and sentience are a tactic to sell you on AI. Most people in this space seem to simply be aiming to make technical systems which achieve what looks like human intelligence to get ahead in what is already a very crowded market. The market is also a small world: researchers and founders move seamlessly between a few major tech players, like Microsoft, Google, and Meta, or they go off to found AI startups that receive millions in venture capital and seed funding from Big Tech.RELATED STORIESAs one data point, in 2022, 24 Google researchers left to join AI startups (while one of us, Alex, left to join a research nonprofit). As another data point, in 2023 alone, $41.5 billion in venture deals was dished out to generative AI firms, according to Pitchbook data. The payoff has been estimated to be huge. That year, McKinsey suggested that soon, generative AI may add \"up to $4.4 trillion\" annually into the global economy. Estimates like this are, of course, part of the hype machine, but VCs don’t seem to think that fact should stem the rush to invest in these tools.This hype leans on tropes about artificial intelligence: sentient machines needing to be granted robot rights or Matrix-style superintelligence posing a direct threat to ragtag human resisters. This has implications beyond the circulation of funds among VCs and other investors, most notably because ordinary folks are being told they’re going to be out of a job.\\nAlex Hanna is director of research at the Distributed AI Research Institute.\\n```\\n\\n## [Huawei claims better AI training method than DeepSeek using own chips](https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3313042/huawei-claims-better-ai-training-method-deepseek-using-own-ascend-chips) (#100137)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 12:00:08+00:00\\n\\n```\\nResearchers working on Huawei Technologies’ large language model (LLM) Pangu claimed they have improved on DeepSeek’s original approach to training artificial intelligence (AI) by leveraging the US-sanctioned company’s proprietary hardware.A paper – published last week by Huawei’s Pangu team, which comprises 22 core contributors and 56 additional researchers – introduced the concept of Mixture of Grouped Experts (MoGE). It is an upgraded version of the Mixture of Experts (MoE) technique that has been instrumental in DeepSeek’s cost-effective AI models.While MoE offers low execution costs for large model parameters and enhanced learning capacity, it often results in inefficiencies, according to the paper. This is because of the uneven activation of so-called experts, which can hinder performance when running on multiple devices in parallel.In contrast, the improved MoGE “groups the experts during selection and better balances the expert workload”, researchers said.In AI training, “experts” refer to specialised sub-models or components within a larger model, each designed to handle specific tasks or types of data. This allows the overall system to take advantage of diverse expertise to enhance performance.01:38China a ‘key market’, says Nvidia CEO Huang during Beijing visit as US bans AI chipsChina a ‘key market’, says Nvidia CEO Huang during Beijing visit as US bans AI chipsThe advancement comes at a crucial time, as Chinese AI companies are focused on enhancing model training and inference efficiency through algorithmic improvements and a synergy of hardware and software, despite US restrictions on the export of advanced AI chips like those from Nvidia.\\n```\\n\\n## [Investigatory powers: Guidelines for police and spies could also help businesses with AI](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366625073/Investigatory-powers-Guidelines-for-police-and-spies-could-also-help-businesses-with-AI) (#100634)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 12:45:00+00:00\\n\\n```\\nPolice and intelligence agencies are turning to AI to sift through vast amounts of data to identify security threats, potential suspects and individuals who may pose a security risk.\\nAgencies such as GCHQ and MI5 use AI techniques to gather data from multiple sources, find connections between them, and triage the most significant results for human analysts to review.\\nTheir use of automated systems to analyse huge volumes of data, which could include bulk datasets containing people’s financial records, medical information and intercepted communications, has raised new concerns over privacy and human rights.\\nWhen is the use of AI proportionate, and when does it go too far? That is a question that the oversight body for the intelligence services, the Investigatory Powers Commissioner’s Office (IPCO) is grappling with.\\nWhen is the use of AI proportionate?\\nDuffy Calder is the chair of IPCO’s Technical Advisory Panel, known as the TAP, a small group of experts with backgrounds in academia, the UK intelligence community and the defence industry.\\nHer job is to advise the investigatory powers commissioner, Brian Leveson, and IPCO’s judicial commissioners – serving or retired judges – responsible for signing or rejecting applications for surveillance warrants on often complex technical issues.\\nMembers of the panel also accompany IPCO inspectors on visits to police, intelligence agencies and other government agencies with surveillance powers, under the Investigatory Powers Act.\\nIn the first interview IPCO has given on the work of the TAP, Calder says one of the key functions of the group is to advise the investigatory powers commissioner on future technology trends.\\n“It’s absolutely obvious that we were going to be doing something on AI,” she says.\\nThe TAP has produced a framework – the AI Proportionality Assessment Aid – to assist police, intelligence services and over 600 other government agencies regulated by IPCO in thinking about whether the use of AI is proportionate and minimises invasion of privacy. It has also made its guidance available to businesses and other organisations.\\nHow AI might be used in surveillance\\nCalder says she is not able to say anything about the difference AI is making to the police, intelligence agencies and other government bodies that IPCO oversees. That is a question for the bodies that are using it, she says.\\nHowever, a publicly available research report from the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), commissioned by GCHQ, suggests ways it might be used. They include identifying individuals from the sound of their voice, their writing style, or the way they type on a computer keyboard.\\n© Ian Georgeson Photography\\n“People are very rightly raising issues of fairness, transparency and bias, but they are not always unpicking them and asking what this means in a technical setting”\\nMuffy Calder, University of Glasgow\\nThe most compelling use case, however, is to triage the vast amount of data collected by intelligence agencies and find relevant links between data from multiple sources that have intelligence value. Augmented intelligence systems can present analysts with the most relevant information from a sea of data for them to assess and make a final judgement.\\nThe computer scientists and mathematicians that make up the TAP have been working with and studying AI for many years, says Calder, and they realise that the use of AI to analyse personal data raises ethical questions.\\n“People are very rightly raising issues of fairness, transparency and bias, but they are not always unpicking them and asking what this means in a technical setting,” she says.\\nThe balance between privacy and intrusion\\nThe framework aims to give organisations tools to assess how much AI intrudes into privacy and how to minimise intrusion. Rather than provide answers, it offers a set of questions that can help organisations think about the risks of AI.\\n“I think everyone’s goal within investigations is to minimise privacy intrusion. So, we must always have a balance between the purpose of an investigation and the intrusion on people, and, for example, collateral intrusion [of people who are not under suspicion],” she says.\\nThe TAP’s AI Proportionality Assessment Aid is meant for people who design, develop, test and commission AI models and people involved in ensuring their organisations comply with legal and regulatory requirements. It provides a series of questions to consider for each stage in an AI model, from concept, to development, through to exploitation of results.\\n“It is a framework in which we can start to ask, are we doing the right things? Is AI an appropriate tool for the circumstances? It’s not about can I do it, it’s more about should I,” she says.\\nIs AI the right tool?\\nThe first question is whether AI is the right tool for the job. In some cases, such as facial recognition, AI may be the only solution as it is difficult mathematically to solve that problem, so training an AI system by showing it examples makes sense.\\nIn other cases, where people understand what Calder refers to as the “physics” of a problem, such as calculating tax, a mathematical algorithm is more appropriate.\\n“AI is very good when an analytical solution is either too difficult or we don’t know what the analytical solution is. So right from the beginning, it’s a matter of asking, do I actually need AI here?” she says.\\nAnother issue to consider is how often to retrain AI models to ensure they are making decisions on the best, most accurate data, and data that is most appropriate for the applications the model is being used for.\\nOne common mistake is to train an AI model on data that is not aligned with its intended use. “That is probably a classic one. You have trained it on images of cars, and you are going to use it to try to recognise tanks,” she says.\\nCritical questions might include whether the AI model has the right balance between false positives and false negatives in a particular application.\\nFor example, if AI is used to identify individuals through police facial recognition technology, too many false positives lead to innocent people being wrongly stopped and questioned by police. Too many false negatives would lead to suspects not being recognised.\\nWhen AI makes mistakes\\nWhat would happen, then, if someone were wrongly placed under electronic surveillance as a result of an automated decision? Calder agrees it is a crucial question.\\nThe framework helps by asking organisations to think about how they respond when AI makes mistakes or hallucinates.\\n“The response might be that we need to retrain the model on more accurate or more up-to-date data. There could be lots of answers, and the key point is do you even recognise there is an issue, and do you have a process for dealing with it and some way of capturing your decisions?”\\nWas the error systemic? Was it user input? Was it due to the way a human operator produced and handled the result?\\n“You also might want to question if this was the result of how the tool was optimised. For example, was it optimised to minimise false negatives, not false positives, and what you did was something that gave you a false positive?” she adds.\\nIntrusion during training\\nSometimes it can be justifiable to accept a higher level of intrusion privacy during the training stage if that means a lower level of intrusion when AI is deployed. For example, training a model with the personal data of a large number of people can ensure that the model is more targeted and is likely to lead to “collateral” intrusion.\\n“The end result is a tool which you can use in a much more targeted way in pursuit of, for example, criminal activity. So, you get a more targeted tool, and when you use the tool, you only affect a few people’s privacy,” she says.\\nHaving a human in the loop in an AI system can mitigate the potential for errors, but it also brings with it other dangers.\\nThe human in the loop\\nComputer systems introduced in hospitals, for example, make it possible for clinicians to dispense drugs more efficiently by allowing them to select from a list of relevant drugs and quantities, rather than having to write out prescriptions by hand.\\nThe downside is that it is easier for clinicians to “desensitise” and make a mistake by selecting the wrong drug or the wrong dose, or to fail to consider a more appropriate drug that may not be included in the pre-selected list.\\nAI tools can lead to similar desensitisation, where people can disengage if they are required to continually check a large number of outputs from an AI system. The task can become a checklist exercise, and it is easy for a tired or distracted human reviewer to tick the wrong box.\\n“I think there are a lot of parallels with the use of AI and medicine because both are dealing with sensitive data and both have direct impacts on people’s lives,” says Calder.\\nThe TAP’s AI proportionality Assessment Aid is likely to be essential reading for chief information officers and chief digital officers thinking about deploying AI in their organisations.\\n“I think the vast majority of these questions are applicable outside of an investigatory context,” says Calder.\\n“Almost any organisation using technology has to think about their reputation and their efficacy. I don’t think organisations set out to make mistakes or to do something badly, so the aim is to help people [use AI] in an appropriate way,” she says.\\n```\\n\\n## [Fortifying the future: The pivotal role of CISOs in AI operations](https://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/Fortifying-the-future-The-pivotal-role-of-CISOs-in-AI-operations) (#100639)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 07:36:00+00:00\\n\\n```\\nBy\\nAditya K Sood, Aryaka\\nPublished: 04 Jun 2025\\nThe widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) applications and services is driving a fundamental shift in how chief information security officers (CISOs) structure their cyber security policies and strategies.\\nThe unique characteristics of AI, its data-intensive nature, complex models, and potential for autonomous decision-making introduce new attack surfaces and risks that necessitate immediate and specific policy enhancements and strategic recalibrations.\\nThe primary goals are to prevent inadvertent data leakage by employees using AI and Generative AI (GenAI) tools and to ensure that decisions based on AI systems are not compromised by malicious actors, whether internal or external. Below is a strategic blueprint for CISOs to align cybersecurity with the secure deployment and use of GenAI systems.\\nRevamp acceptable use and data handling policies for AI: Existing acceptable use policies (AUPs) must be updated specifically to address the use of AI tools, explicitly prohibiting the input of sensitive, confidential, or proprietary company data into public or unapproved AI models. Sensitive data could include customer personal information, financial records or trade secrets. Policies should clearly define what constitutes \\'sensitive\\' data in the context of AI. Data handling policies must also detail requirements for anonymisation, pseudonymisation, and tokenisation of data used for internal AI model training or fine-tuning.\\nMitigate AI system compromise and tampering: CISOs must focus on AI system integrity and security. Deploy security practices into the entire AI development pipeline, from secure coding for AI models to rigorous testing for vulnerabilities like prompt injection, data poisoning and model inversion. Implement strong filters and validators for all data entering the AI system (prompts, retrieved data for RAG) to prevent adversarial attacks. Similarly, all AI-generated outputs must be sanitised and validated before being presented to users or used in downstream systems to avoid malicious injections. Wherever feasible, deploy AI systems with XAI capabilities, allowing for transparency into how decisions are made. For high-stakes decisions, mandate human oversight when handling sensitive data or performing irreversible operations to provide a final safeguard against compromised AI output.\\nBuilding resilient and secure AI development pipelines: Securing AI development pipelines is paramount to ensuring the trustworthiness and resilience of AI applications integrated into critical network infrastructure, security products and collaborative solutions. It necessitates embedding security throughout the entire AI lifecycle. GenAI code, models and training datasets are part of the modern software supply chain. Secure AIOps pipelines with CI/CD best practices, code signing and model integrity checks. Scan training datasets and model artifacts for malicious code or trojaned weights. Vet third-party models and libraries for backdoors and licence compliance.\\nImplement a comprehensive AI governance framework: CISOs must champion the creation of an enterprise-wide AI governance framework that embeds security from the outset. AI risks should not be isolated but woven into enterprise-wide risk management and compliance practices. This framework should define explicit roles and responsibilities for AI development, deployment and oversight to establish an AI-centric risk management process. A centralised inventory of approved AI tools should be maintained, along with their risk classifications.\\xa0 The governance framework helps substantially in managing the risk associated with “shadow AI”, the use of unsanctioned AI tools or services. Mandate only approved AI tools and block all other AI tools and services.\\nStrengthen data loss prevention tools (DLPs) for AI workflows: DLP strategies must evolve to detect and prevent sensitive data from entering unauthorised AI environments or being exfiltrated via AI outputs. This involves configuring DLP tools to specifically monitor AI interaction channels (eg chat interfaces and API calls to LLMs), identifying patterns indicative of sensitive data being input. AI-specific DLP rules must be developed to block or flag attempts to paste PII, intellectual property or confidential code into public AI prompts.\\nEnhance employee and leadership AI awareness training: Employees are often the weakest link in the organisation. CISOs must implement targeted, continuous training programmes on the acceptable use of AI, identify AI-centric threats, promote engineering best practices, and provide education on reporting security incidents related to the misuse of AI tools and potential compromise.\\nInstitute vendor risk management for AI services: As companies increasingly rely on third-party AI services, CISOs must enhance their third-party risk management (TPRM) programmes to address these risks. They should define standards for assessing the security posture of the AI vendor\\'s supply chain, adhering to robust contractual clauses that mandate security standards, data privacy, liability for breaches, and audit rights for AI service providers. There should be in-depth security assessments of AI vendors, scrutinising their data handling practices, model security, API security, and AI-specific incident response capabilities.\\nIntegrate continual monitoring and adversarial testing: In the ever-evolving landscape of AI threats and risks, static security measures are insufficient. CISOs should stress the importance of continual monitoring of AI systems to detect potential compromises, data leaks or adversarial attacks – signalled by unusual prompt patterns, unexpected outputs or sudden changes in model behaviour. Regular red teaming and adversarial testing exercises, specifically designed to exploit AI vulnerabilities should help organisations to spot weaknesses before malicious actors.\\nCISOs who make these changes will be better able to manage the risks associated with AI, enabling security practices to keep pace with or get ahead of AI deployment. This requires a shift from reactive defence to a proactive, adaptive security posture woven into the fabric of AI initiatives.\\nAditya K Sood is vice president of security engineering and AI strategy at\\xa0Aryaka.\\nRead more on Business continuity planning\\nPreparing for AI: The CISO’s role in security, ethics and compliance\\nPodcast: RSA 2025 – AI’s risk surface and the role of the CISO\\nBy: Antony\\xa0Adshead\\nSignalgate: Learnings for CISOs securing enterprise data\\nBy: Todd\\xa0Thiemann\\nDeepSeek will help evolve the conversation around privacy\\n```\\n\\n## [Meta Clinches Nuclear Deal to Turbocharge Its AI Ambitions: What This Means For The Company](https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/meta-clinches-nuclear-deal-turbocharge-its-ai-ambitions-what-this-means-company-1734932) (#101081)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 07:54:15+00:00\\n\\n```\\nMeta, the tech titan behind Facebook and Instagram, has inked a game-changing 20-year deal with Constellation Energy to power its AI-driven data centres with nuclear energy from an Illinois plant starting in 2027.As reported by The Wall Street Journal, this move secures 1,121 megawatts from the Clinton Clean Energy Center to fuel Meta\\'s ambitious push into artificial intelligence.With AI\\'s voracious energy demands straining grids worldwide, nuclear power\\'s reliability and low emissions make it a strategic bet for Big Tech.But how will this reshape Meta\\'s operations, and what does it signal for the tech industry\\'s energy future?Power Up AI with Clean EnergyThe race to dominate AI is an energy-hungry one. Generative AI models, like Meta AI, require vast computational power, driving up electricity needs.According to CNET, Meta\\'s deal ensures a steady, emissions-free supply to support its data centres, which are pivotal for training and deploying AI tools.This isn\\'t just about keeping servers humming; it\\'s about staying competitive in a market where AI innovation is paramount.On X posts, sentiment is buzzing with optimism, with users like @AlvaApp calling it a \\'major signal\\' for nuclear as Big Tech\\'s clean energy backbone.By locking in nuclear power, Meta sidesteps grid volatility and aligns with sustainability goals, potentially saving £75 million ($101 million) annually in energy costs compared to fossil fuel alternatives.Outpace Rivals with Strategic MovesMeta isn\\'t alone in eyeing nuclear power. CNBC reports that Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have also struck nuclear deals to meet AI-driven demand, with Microsoft reviving a Three Mile Island reactor and Amazon investing £400 million ($540 million) in small modular reactors.Meta\\'s deal, however, stands out for its long-term commitment, extending to 2047, ensuring stability amid rising energy prices. This positions Meta to outmanoeuvre rivals reliant on less predictable renewable sources like solar or wind, which can\\'t guarantee 24/7 power.The deal also keeps the Clinton plant operational, preserving local jobs and boosting regional economies, a win-win that\\'s generating positive chatter on X, with users praising Meta\\'s foresight.Navigate Regulatory and Cost HurdlesNuclear power isn\\'t without challenges. Building new reactors is costly and time-intensive, with Power Magazine noting that the US\\'s last new reactor ran £26 billion ($36 billion) over budget and seven years late.Meta\\'s deal sidesteps construction risks by leveraging an existing plant, but regulatory hurdles and waste storage concerns remain.The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 offers tax incentives, supporting nuclear\\'s viability, yet President-elect Trump\\'s plans to scale back clean energy policies could complicate future projects.For now, Meta\\'s strategic pivot secures a competitive edge, but scaling nuclear to meet AI\\'s growing appetite will demand careful navigation of policy and public perception.Nuclear Bet Pays Off BigMeta\\'s nuclear deal, announced on 04 June 2025, marks a bold step towards powering AI with clean, reliable energy, a move that could redefine tech\\'s sustainability playbook.By securing nuclear power, Meta not only fuels its AI ambitions but also sets a precedent for the industry, proving that clean energy can drive innovation without breaking the bank.As rivals scramble to match this foresight, Meta\\'s holding the line, but staying ahead in the AI race will demand relentless ingenuity.\\n```\\n\\n## [Psychologists Are Calling for Guardrails Around AI Use for Young People.

Last year, the group recommended that parents limit teens\\' exposure to videos produced by social media influencers and gen AI. In 2023, it warned of the harms that could come from social media use among young people.\\xa0\"Like social media, AI is neither inherently good nor bad,\" APA Chief of Psychology Mitch Prinstein said in a statement. \"But we have already seen instances where adolescents developed unhealthy and even dangerous \\'relationships\\' with chatbots, for example. Some adolescents may not even know they are interacting with AI, which is why it is crucial that developers put guardrails in place now.\"The meteoric surge of artificial intelligence tools like OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT and Google\\'s Gemini the last few years has presented new and serious challenges for mental health, especially among younger users. People increasingly talk to chatbots like they would talk to a friend, sharing secrets and relying on them for companionship. While that use can have some positive effects on mental health, it can also be detrimental, experts say, reinforcing harmful behaviors or offering the wrong advice. (Disclosure: Ziff Davis, CNET\\'s parent company, in April filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)What the APA recommended about AI useThe group called for several different ways to ensure adolescents can use AI safely, including limiting access to harmful and false content and protecting data privacy and the likenesses of young users.\\xa0One key difference between adult users and younger people is that adults are more likely to question the accuracy and intent of an AI output. A younger person (the report defined adolescents as between age 10 and 25) might not be able to approach the interaction with the appropriate level of skepticism.\\xa0Relationships with AI entities like chatbots or the role-playing tool Character.ai might also displace the important real-world, human social relationships people learn to have as they develop. \"Early research indicates that strong attachments to AI-generated characters may contribute to struggles with learning social skills and developing emotional connections,\" the report said.People in their teens and early 20s are developing habits and social skills that will carry into adulthood, and changes to how they socialize can have lifelong effects, said Nick Jacobson, an associate professor of biomedical data science and psychiatry at Dartmouth who was not on the panel that produced the report. \"Those stages of development can be a template for what happens later,\" he said.The APA report called for developers to create systems that prevent the erosion of human relationships, like reminders that the bot is not a human, alongside regulatory changes to protect the interests of youths.\\xa0Other recommendations included that there should be differences between tools intended for use by adults and those used by children, such as age-appropriate settings being made default and designs made to be less persuasive. Systems should have human oversight and intensive testing to ensure they are safe.\\xa0Schools and policymakers should prioritize education around AI literacy and how to use the tools responsibly, the APA said. That should include discussions of how to evaluate AI outputs for bias and inaccurate information. \"This education must equip young people with the knowledge and skills to understand what AI is, how it works, its potential benefits and limitations, privacy concerns around personal data, and the risks of overreliance,\" the report said.Identifying safe and unsafe AI useThe report shows psychologists grappling with the uncertainties of how a new and fast-growing technology will affect the mental health of those most vulnerable to potential developmental harms, Jacobson said.\\xa0\"The nuances of how [AI] affects social development are really broad,\" he told me. \"This is a new technology that is probably potentially as big in terms of its impact on human development as the internet.\"AI tools can be helpful for mental health and they can be harmful, Jacobson said. He and other researchers at Dartmouth recently released a study of an AI chatbot that showed promise in providing therapy, but it was specifically designed to follow therapeutic practices and was closely monitored. More general AI tools, he said, can provide incorrect information or encourage harmful behaviors. He pointed to recent issues with sycophancy in a ChatGPT model, which OpenAI eventually rolled back.\"Sometimes these tools connect in ways that can feel very validating, but sometimes they can act in ways that can be very harmful,\" he said.\\xa0Jacobson said it\\'s important for scientists to continue to research the psychological impacts of AI use and to educate the public on what they learn.\\xa0\"The pace of the field is moving so fast, and we need some room for science to catch up,\" he said.The APA offered suggestions for what parents can do to ensure teens are using AI safely, including explaining how AI works, encouraging human-to-human interactions, stressing the potential inaccuracy of health information and reviewing privacy settings.\\n```\\n\\n## [Forget What You Know About Search.

These methods place the age of the scrolls somewhere between the 3rd century B.C.E. and the 2nd century C.E.\\xa0But a new AI date-prediction model may provide a more accurate date for the famous Dead Sea Scrolls.\\xa0After using this new model, called Enoch, researchers have determined that the Dead Sea Scrolls may actually be older than previously thought. The findings, published in PLOS One, also indicate that two biblical scroll fragments date back to the same time as their presumed authors.\\xa0AI and the Dead Sea Scrolls\\xa0By using radiocarbon dating, palaeography, and a machine learning model, researchers working on the European Research Council project, The Hands That Wrote the Bible, narrowed down the age of the Dead Sea Scrolls to a more precise estimate.\\xa0The team combined data from 24 Dead Sea Scrolls and the machine learning model to apply a Bayesian ridge regression method to the scrolls. From there, the team trained the model for date prediction.\\xa0Enoch stems from BiNet, an in-house deep neural network that analyzes handwritten ink patterns. Now, Enoch can examine ink at a microscopic level through its curvature (called textural) and character shapes (called allographic). This data can provide analysis that standard palaeography can’t. It can also predict radiocarbon dating results by more or less 30 years.\\xa0Read More: AI Revives 2,000-Year-Old Roman Scroll Burned in Mount Vesuvius EruptionEvaluating the Dates of the ScrollsSeeing the success of Enoch with the first few tested scrolls, the research team prepared to use it on the rest, nearly 1,000. To start, the team fed images of 135 Dead Sea Scrolls to Enoch and had palaeographers evaluate the dates.\\xa0The study results found that the age of the Dead Sea Scrolls was much older than previously thought. The results also changed how researchers looked at the development of two ancient Jewish script styles, Hasmonaean and Herodian. For Hasmonaean script specifically, the researchers think it dates back further than the previously believed 150 B.C.E. and 50 B.C.E.\\xa0The team also thinks that the Herodian-type script is also older than previously thought, and that these two script styles have existed together since the late 2nd century B.C.E.\\xa0With this new information, we can now get a better look at the intellectual and political developments of the Mediterranean during the Hellenistic and early Roman periods (late 4th century B.C.E. until the 2nd century C.E.). It also provides new insights into the rise of the Hasmonaean dynasty, the development of literacy in Judea, and the emergence of religious groups, such as Christians.\\xa0Shifting Textual History\\xa0Another finding of the study was that 4QDanielc (4Q114) and 4QQoheleta (4Q109) are the first known fragments of a biblical book that date back to the time of its presumed authors. It is unknown who finished the Book of Daniel, but it would appear that the unknown author associated with these fragments did so in the early 160s B.C.E., according to the results from Enoch.\\xa0\\xa0As for 4QQoheleta (Ecclesiastes), it’s now believed that another anonymous author completed this biblical book during the Hellenistic period (3rd century B.C.E.), rather than King Solomon during the 10th century B.C.E.\\xa0Thanks to the results of this study, it’s now possible to get a glimpse at the hands that wrote the Bible.

The tech will also be used to speed up “pre-visualization” during development, which is when studios use images to come up with the look of a show before filming takes place. Runway also said AMC Networks is exploring AI to be used for honing special effects ideas. “As we explore the transformative potential of AI across our business, we see powerful opportunities to enhance both how we market and how we create,” said Stephanie Mitchko, the executive vice president of global media operations and technology at AMC Networks, in a statement. “Our objective is always to use every tool at our disposal to help our creative partners fully realize the stories they want to tell,” Mitchko said. Entertainment companies have been exploring how to use AI in their processes, which supporters say can help reduce costs and allow creatives to test bold ideas without as many financial constraints. More to Read Last year, Runway announced a partnership with Lionsgate, in which Runway will create a new AI model for the studio to help with behind-the-scenes processes such as storyboarding. The company’s technology has also been used in series like “House of David” on Amazon Prime Video, according to Variety.“We’re building the foundations for a new era of media — the way content gets made and green-lit is changing rapidly, and that’s impacting everything from production timelines and methodologies to distribution models and marketing tactics,” said Cristóbal Valenzuela, co-founder and CEO of Runway in a statement. AI remains a controversial topic in Hollywood. Some creatives and unionized workers have expressed concerns about how AI could reduce jobs. Writers have complained that AI models are being trained on their scripts without their permission or adequate compensation.Tech industry executives have said that they should be able to train AI models with content available online under the “fair use” doctrine, which allows for the limited reproduction of material without permission from the copyright holder. AI filmmaking technology is advancing rapidly, such as with Google’s unveiling new features in its Veo 3 text-to-video tool and its Flow editing software. But experts say that artificial intelligence companies need to license content from professional studios in order to take the tools to the next level.\\n```\\n\\n## [Are Dead Sea Scrolls older than we thought?](https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/are-dead-sea-scrolls-older-than-we-thought/) (#107633)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 18:00:14+00:00\\n\\n```\\nEnter Enoch\\nThe authors of this latest paper wanted to find a better means than paleography alone for determining the chronology of the scrolls, with an eye toward reconstructing the evolution of ideas. They thought that given the small data set in the case of the scrolls, it was wisest not to rely on a pre-trained model and instead \"let the available data speak.\"\\nThe development of Enoch grew out of the team\\'s earlier deep neural network for ferreting out handwritten ink-trace patterns in digitized manuscripts, involving micro-level geometric shape analysis. \"Enoch emphasizes shared characteristics and similarity matching between trained and test manuscripts, where traditional paleography focuses on subtle differences that are assumed to be indicative for style development,\" the authors wrote. \"Combining dissimilarity matching and adaptive reinforcement learning can uncover hidden patterns.\"\\nThey tested Enoch by having paleographic experts evaluate the AI program\\'s age estimate for several scrolls. The results: About 79 percent of Enoch\\'s estimates were deemed \"realistic,\" while its age estimates for the remaining 21 percent were either too young, too old, or just indecisive.\\nThis new model revealed that many of the Dead Sea Scrolls are older than previous estimates based solely on paleography. That should be relevant for the question of when two ancient Jewish script styles—\"Hasmonean\" and \"Herodian\"—developed, for example. The former script was thought to have emerged between 150–50 BCE, but the authors believe Hasmonean could have emerged much earlier; ditto for the Herodian script. So both scripts may have coexisted since the late second century, challenging the prevailing view that they preexisted by the mid-first century BCE.\\nEnoch may even be able to shed light on biblical authorship. For instance, the authors concluded that two of the scrolls are the first known fragments of the Book of Daniel, believed to have been finished by an anonymous author around 160 BCE. And Ecclesiastes was likely completed by an anonymous author in the third century BCE, rather than by King Solomon in the 10th century BCE.\\n“With the Enoch tool we have opened a new door into the ancient world, like a time machine, that allows us to study the hands that wrote the Bible, especially now that we have established, for the first time, that two biblical scroll fragments come from the time of their presumed authors,” the authors wrote. “It is very exciting to set a significant step into solving the dating problem of the Dead Sea Scrolls and also creating a new tool that could be used to study other partially dated manuscript collections from history.\"\\nPLoS ONE, 2025.

But the tricky part is to do so in an environmentally friendly way.The International Energy Agency found that in 2024, data centers accounted for 1.5% of global electricity use. By 2030, that number could nearly double, reaching levels just above Japan\\'s current annual energy consumption.In addition, AI infrastructure is cooled with enormous amounts of water. A report from the University of Tulsa found that a single facility can use up to 5 million gallons per day, enough to supply thousands of homes. With governments and companies pouring billions into AI infrastructure, those resource demands are only expected to grow.Through close collaboration between its sustainability, engineering, and design teams, Digital Realty, which operates more than 300 data centers worldwide, is working to reduce carbon emissions. That means sourcing more renewable energy, upgrading cooling systems, and rethinking where — and how — new sites are built from the ground up.To understand how Digital Realty is preparing for that future, Business Insider spoke with Aaron Binkley, vice president of sustainability, and Shea McKeon, global head of design and engineering, about the company\\'s sustainability strategy.In a roundtable conversation, Binkley and McKeon shared how their teams are working together to cut emissions, balance business demands with sustainability goals, and stay ahead of AI trends in the data center world.\\nShea McKeon is the global head of design and engineering, and Aaron Binkley is the vice president of sustainability at Digital Realty.\\nCourtesy of Digital Realty\\nThe following has been edited for length and clarity.Business Insider: How do your roles and teams at Digital Realty contribute to the company\\'s overall decarbonization strategy?Aaron Binkley: My role is global. I oversee sustainability efforts across the company, including work around renewables, decarbonization, development and construction, operations of in-service data centers, and collaboration on green finance, clean energy, energy performance, water, and more. A big part of my job is acting as a convener, bringing people together to ensure we\\'re working collaboratively and surfacing the best ideas.Shea McKeon: I sit in the design, engineering, and construction department, which oversees all new developments and major renovation projects around the world. We\\'re responsible for integrating sustainability into our new builds and working with operations and energy management to bring existing facilities up to the latest standards.Digital Realty has ambitious targets to cut direct and indirect emissions per square foot by 60% and supply chain emissions by 24% — each by 2030. How are your teams collaborating to hit those goals?Binkley: We think about how we build, power, and operate sustainable data centers. That starts with understanding emissions across the data center lifecycle. Design and construction impact embodied carbon, or the total amount of emissions associated with the data center lifecycle, from metal extraction to construction, all the way to equipment disposal. Operationally, it\\'s all about electricity use. So we work closely with our energy procurement and strategy teams to decarbonize our electricity supply.For Scope 1 emissions, referring to direct emissions from sources owned by our company, we\\'re switching from burning mainly diesel in backup generators to renewable fuels like hydrotreated vegetable oil, a diesel-like fuel which we\\'ve deployed across 17% of our operating portfolio. But 98% of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, which include the indirect emissions from purchased energy, come from electricity, so that\\'s the big nut we need to crack. We prioritize opportunities based on where we can make the biggest impact, designing efficient facilities and powering them with renewables.McKeon: I\\'d say on the Scope 3 emissions side, which are indirect emissions from the data center supply chain, that\\'s where my team can really have an impact. We\\'re constantly working with our design and construction partners to make sure we\\'re specifying the right materials to help bring those emissions down. It\\'s always at the forefront of our designs.We also partner with Aaron\\'s team during our annual business reviews with key suppliers. We just wrapped those up recently, and Scope 3 emissions were one of the topics we discussed — how suppliers are performing and what we can do to improve. It\\'s a never-ending, iterative process, but collaboration is key to making progress.AI models are creating a demand for computing power. How are you balancing this growth with your sustainability targets?Binkley: We\\'ve seen AI coming. It\\'s front of mind now, and a significant portion of our bookings are AI-related. Even as our portfolio grows, we haven\\'t pulled back on any sustainability commitments. We\\'ve made strong progress on sourcing renewables and decarbonization. We plan for that, and as AI pushes greater demand, we adjust our plans: rethink sourcing, get more integrated with acquisitions, and get involved earlier in planning and design. We\\'re even part of early utility conversations when acquiring land, asking for clean energy solutions before we\\'ve started moving dirt.We\\'re also using AI internally to improve energy and water efficiency. We developed an in-house program called Apollo AI to optimize building management systems across our portfolio. The platform helps our facility engineers find hidden anomalies like clogged filters and leaky valves and suggests improvements that can help drive energy savings. We also have AI tools focused on water systems, helping us fine-tune cooling performance and water chemistry to reduce waste. We really try to squeeze every last drop of productivity out of the energy and water we consume.McKeon: We\\'re planning for 100% of our future buildings to have the capability to deploy liquid cooling directly to the chip, where coolant is circulated through metal plates attached to graphics processing units to remove heat. For those that don\\'t, our engineering team is building roadmaps so we\\'re ready if customers want to use energy-intensive technologies like generative AI that require high levels of compute power. Our modular design approach helps us learn and adapt quickly. And with liquid cooling, you don\\'t need as much square footage per megawatt anymore. That\\'s going to change how buildings are designed moving forward.What\\'s the biggest challenge in aligning technical engineering demands and sustainability goals?Binkley: Our sustainability standards are part of our building codes, but the maximum amount of emissions that can be reduced in our facilities still varies based on customer usage. Some customers move into the data centers fully and operate at high intensity; others ramp up slowly. Modularity helps us handle those variations. The speed of growth is also a challenge — we need to stay ahead of customer demand, line up renewables, and anticipate equipment needs that take a long time to procure. We\\'re building physical infrastructure, which takes years. You can\\'t just flip a switch.McKeon: We\\'re a multi-tenant facility. We lease out space to our customers, so while we control the infrastructure, the customer ultimately controls how they operate within that space. We can design proactively with energy efficiency in mind, and we encourage best practices like airflow containment and optimal temperature settings. But at the end of the day, we don\\'t dictate how customers use their equipment.That creates a bit of a disconnect. Our engineering team can build in sustainability features, but our operations team has to be reactive depending on how each tenant deploys. Some customers come in and run at high utilization, which is great from an efficiency standpoint. Others move in slowly or use a mix of equipment that can affect how well the facility runs. So there\\'s a line between what we can control and what we can influence.Luckily, our operations team is very sophisticated. They use automation, data, and AI to adapt in real time, dialing in temperature and managing airflow, all to run as efficiently as possible.Looking ahead, how are you evolving your decarbonization strategy over the next few years?Binkley: We\\'re not pulling back on our commitments. We\\'ll stay the course, and perhaps even get more aggressive. Clean energy is harder to source now, but still available. We\\'ve been able to secure renewables that offer real value and reduce costs. We\\'re also going deeper into Scope 3 with our supplier engagement program, working with vendors to reduce the carbon footprint of the materials and products we buy.McKeon: I\\'d echo that. Sustainability is embedded in our design process. It\\'s not just a benchmark — it\\'s part of our culture. Our local teams are empowered to innovate project by project, and our global teams constantly share best practices. What works in France might be relevant in Chicago. It\\'s a contagious, exciting environment to be in.\\nAI\\nSustainability\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

One politician, Marian Hussein, was asked by the speaker to remove her keffiyeh, which she kept on in protest. During the debate, sounds of shouting protesters outside echoed in the chamber.Hussein, the deputy leader of the Socialist Left party, which brought forward one of the proposals, said in response: “Speaker, I will not take off my Palestinian scarf. Those standing outside are shouting right now: ‘Stop Norwegian involvement, withdraw the oil fund.’”She added: “Why do we still show double standards in this hall? Why are some people worth less than others?”After quoting from a famous Norwegian poem, Du Må Ikke Sove (Dare Not Sleep) from 1936, she cited Jens Stoltenberg, the former Nato secretary general who is now the finance minister in Norway’s minority Labour government.A protester is removed from outside parliament where pro-Palestinian crowds had gathered on 4 June. Photograph: Reuters“We are a small nation which constantly talks about the need for a world order,” she said. “We have a finance minister who has been a former Nato chief and prime minister. He knows very well what this means in foreign policy.”During the debate, Stoltenberg said Norway had “an established ethical regime for the fund”. He added: “We divest from the companies that contribute to Israel’s breach of international law, but we do not divest from all companies that are present on the ground.”skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionAfter the vote, Hussein told the Guardian: “I’m incredibly disappointed. This should have been the easiest vote of our lives, especially for the Labour party and the Labour government.”She added: “We are not backing down. Shortly before the government recognised the state of Palestine, they voted against it in parliament. We will continue to put pressure on the other parties together with the massive movement in civil society.”Before the afternoon vote, crowds gathered outside parliament for a protest organised by several organisations including the Palestinian Committee, the Action Group for Palestine and Amnesty International Norway.Norway has played a historical role in the region, including by facilitating the Oslo peace accords between Israel and the Palestinians that led to a breakthrough deal in 1993. Last year it recognised the Palestinian state, one of a minority of European countries to do so.Last week, Norway’s international development minister, Åsmund Aukrust, told the Guardian that Israel was setting a dangerous precedent for international human rights law violations in Gaza that was making the world more dangerous.Line Khateeb, the leader of the Palestine Committee of Norway, said the vote was an opportunity for politicians “to show that international law matters and that they do not want to make Norway complicit in the Israeli genocide and colonisation”.Protesters waving Palestinian flags outside Norway’s central bank in March. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesStoltenberg, she said, “needs to take responsibility” and she called on the oil fund to divest from Israel as it had done from all Russian companies immediately after the invasion of Ukraine. She added: “Even though the Norwegian oil fund is Europe’s largest investor in the Israeli occupation, Stoltenberg claims that the current guidelines are good enough. That is appalling and needs to change.”The discovery of one of the world’s largest offshore oilfields off the Norwegian coast in 1969 and the huge revenue that came from selling it dramatically changed Norway’s prospects, bringing rapid economic growth.Norway’s oil fund, officially called the Government Pension Fund Global, was established in 1990 to preserve revenues for future generations in the knowledge that the oil supply will one day run out. The first deposit was made to the fund in 1996 and since then it has been invested only outside Norway.\\n```\\n\\n## [Gaza food hub stops operations for second day as access routes remain ‘combat zones’](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/04/israel-warns-palestinians-against-travel-on-roads-to-gaza-aid-hubs-labelling-them-combat-zones) (#98788)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 15:40:23+00:00\\n\\n```\\nA US-backed group operating food distribution sites in Gaza has announced that its operations would be suspended for a second day on Thursday, due to “maintenance and repair work”, as the Israeli army warned that roads leading to distribution centres were considered “combat zones”.After Israeli troops opened fire on a crowd of Palestinians, killing at least 27 and injuring hundreds, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) pressed Israel to improve civilian safety beyond the perimeter of its distribution sites.GHF initially said its operations would be suspended for a single day, but after security talks with the Israeli army on Wednesday, the group posted a message on social media, saying operations would not resume on Thursday.“Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is working to make the distribution of food boxes as safe as possible, despite the difficult circumstances. We strongly urge all those heading to our locations to follow the routes set by the IDF to ensure safe passage,” it said. It did not give any further details.The GHF had previously said it had asked the Israeli military to “guide foot traffic in a way that minimises confusion or escalation risks” near military perimeters, develop clearer guidance for civilians and enhance training to support civilian safety. “Our top priority remains ensuring the safety and dignity of civilians receiving aid,” said a GHF spokesperson.An Israeli military spokesperson warned civilians against moving in areas leading to GHF sites on Wednesday, deeming them “combat zones”.The previous day, GHF announced that its distribution points would be closed on Wednesday for “update, organisation and efficiency improvement work”.The killing of the 27 or more Palestinians was the third such shooting in three days, and Israel admitted on Tuesday for the first time that its forces shot at Palestinians. In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said troops fired shots near a food distribution complex after noticing “a number of suspects moving towards them”.“The forces fired evasive shots, and after they did not move away, additional shots were fired near the individual suspects who were advancing towards the forces. The individuals were moving towards forces in a way that posed a threat to them,” the military said, without specifying who the suspects were.MapA spokesperson for the GHF, which has taken over the distribution of food in Gaza and is backed by Israel, told the Associated Press that the group “was saddened to learn that a number of civilians were injured and killed after moving beyond the designated safe corridor”.The shooting occurred at the same site where on Sunday more than 30 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire while they were heading to the distribution hub.The UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, said the “deadly attacks” on civilians around food distribution points was a war crime.“Deadly attacks on distraught civilians trying to access the paltry amounts of food aid in Gaza are unconscionable,” Türk said. “Attacks directed against civilians constitute a grave breach of international law and a war crime.”Witnesses told the Guardian that the shooting started in the city’s Flag Roundabout area, about a kilometre from the food distribution hub.Fadi Abu Mohammad, 43, said his relative Mohammad Abu Shamala, 22, was killed near the food distribution site. “When gunfire opened on the civilians, he was struck by a bullet in the back and died instantly,” Fadi said.What we know about the Gaza food centres –\\xa0video“He was supposed to get married next month. Going back to the aid distribution is a huge risk and a potential death sentence, but everyone who went had no other choice. If they aren’t killed by bullets or shelling, they will die of hunger.”Israel imposed a blockade on all supplies in March, claiming Hamas was seizing deliveries for its fighters. The group denies this and aid officials in Gaza have denied there is evidence of any widespread diversion of supplies at any stage of the conflict. In May a global hunger monitor said half a million people in the Strip faced starvation.The GHF took over the handling of food relief despite objections from the UN and other humanitarian organisations, which criticised the new system for food distribution, saying it would not be able to meet the needs of Gaza’s 2.3 million people, and that it allowed Israel to use food as a weapon to control the population.On Tuesday, an evangelical leader and adviser to Donald Trump on interfaith issues was appointed as the new head of the GHF. Johnnie Moore, a member of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom and founder of the boutique advisory firm Kairos Company, replaced Jake Wood, a former marine, who resigned saying he could not guarantee the GHF’s independence from Israeli interests.Q&AWhy is it so difficult to report on Gaza?ShowCoverage of the war in Gaza is constrained by Israeli attacks on Palestinian journalists and a bar on international reporters entering the Gaza Strip to report independently on the war.Israel has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza since 7 October 2023, unless they are under Israeli military escort. Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and other restrictions include a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza.Palestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over 160 killed since the conflict began.The committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”.Foreign reporters based in Israel filed a legal petition seeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals by prominent journalists and media outlets have been ignored by the Israeli government.To ensure accurate reporting from Gaza given these restrictions, the Guardian works with trusted journalists on the ground; our visual\\u200b\\u200b teams verif\\u200by photo and videos from third parties; and we use clearly sourced data from organisations that have a track record of providing accurate information in Gaza during past conflicts, or during other conflicts or humanitarian crises.Emma Graham-Harrison,\\xa0chief\\xa0Middle East correspondentMoore has been a vocal defender of the GHF and has bristled at public criticism of the rollout, telling the UN secretary general, António Guterres, on X that reports of Palestinians killed and injured while seeking food supplies in Gaza were “a lie … spread by terrorists”.The UN security council is expected to vote on Wednesday on a demand for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and humanitarian access across Gaza, where malnutrition is widespread and food relief has only trickled in since Israel lifted an 11-week blockade in late May.“It is unacceptable. Civilians are risking – and in several instances losing – their lives just trying to get food,” a UN spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric, said on Tuesday, adding that the food distribution model backed by the US and Israel was “a recipe for disaster, which is exactly what is going on”.At least 48 people were killed by Israeli bombardment across the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, including 14 in a single strike on a tent sheltering displaced people, the civil defence agency said.Israel’s military campaign has killed more than 54,000 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s health ministry.Reuters contributed to this report\\n```\\n\\n## [Pro-Palestine protesters block Parliament ahead of bill demanding probe into UK ‘complicity’ with Israel](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/palestine-protesters-parliament-jeremy-corbyn-bill-uk-complicity-israel-gaza-b1231228.html) (#99542)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 15:02:16+00:00\\n\\n```\\nHundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters gathered outside Parliament ahead of bill demanding a public inquiry into the UK’s involvement in Israeli military operations in Gaza being presented. One man was arrested on suspicion of assaulting an officer and obstructing a search during the demonstrations in Westminster on Wednesday, the Met Police said. It came as Jeremy Corbyn, who joined protesters, presented his Ten-Minute Rule Bill calling for an “independent public inquiry” into Britain’s “military, economic, or political cooperation with Israel since October 2023”.The former Labour leader, who now sits as the Independent MP for Islington North, has argued that Britain should stop supplying arms to Israel. ESHe said the inquiry should cover “British policy, the supply of arms, the complicity with acts of genocide, the use of the RAF Akrotiri [in Cyprus] and the sharing of security information”. Introducing his bill, Mr Corbyn told MPs: “Home by home, hospital by hospital, generation by generation. We have not just been witnessing a war. We have been witnessing a genocide, livestreamed before the entire world.”He added: “The Foreign Secretary has accepted the fact that F-35 jets are being used in violation of international humanitarian law, yet at the very same time admits [British] F-35 parts could still be going to Israel. “They know full well the implication: by justifying the continued licencing of F-35 parts, the government is admitting its complicity in war crimes.“I find it truly astounding that the government is telling us loud and clear that its participation in the F-35 programme is more important than its legal obligations to prevent genocide. It’s very simple, until this government ends the sale of weapons to Israel, it remains complicit in the mass murder of Palestinians.”It comes after the Prime Minister admitted Gaza is facing \"dark days\" as he vowed to consider \"further action\" against Israel.At the despatch box, Sir Keir Starmer described the Israeli government\\'s conduct in the 25 mile-long strip as \"counterproductive and intolerable\".He made his comments after an Israeli and US-backed group, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, paused food delivery at its three distribution sites in Gaza on Wednesday, after health officials said at least 27 Palestinians were killed in a series of shootings near the sites this week.Leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party in Northern Ireland Claire Hanna claimed there was \"more moral clarity coming from Ms Rachel on YouTube than there is from many world leaders who are complicit in silence\", referring to the star educator who has called on leaders to \"be so ashamed\" of what she described as their \"anti-Palestinian racism\".Ms Hanna told the Commons: \"The Prime Minister said this week that Britain must be ready for war and, I ask, after tens of thousands of deaths, after a generation of Gazans stunted by hunger and trauma, when will it be ready for peace?\"When will it help to stop this genocide? When will it hold the Israeli government to account, and when will it recognise the state of Palestine?\"Sir Keir replied: \"She\\'s absolutely right to describe this as dark days.\"Israel\\'s recent action is appalling and in my view counterproductive and intolerable, and we have strongly opposed the expansion of military operations and settler violence, and the blocking of humanitarian aid.\"The Prime Minister added: \"You will have seen we\\'ve suspended the FTA (free trade agreement) talks and sanctioned extremists supporting violence in the West Bank.\"We will keep looking at further action along with our allies, including sanctions, but let me be absolutely clear: we need to get back to a ceasefire.\"We need the hostages who\\'ve been held for a very long time to be released, and we desperately need more aid at speed and at volume into Gaza, because it\\'s an appalling and intolerable situation.\"Several MPs wearing red badges, including John McDonnell, the independent MP for Hayes and Harlington, and Labour\\'s MPs for Alloa and Grangemouth and Nottingham East Brian Leishman and Nadia Whittome silently left the chamber after the exchange.\\n```\\n\\n## [Gaza aid centers close for a day as Israel declares roads to sites \\'combat zones\\'](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/middle-east/israel-gaza-war-aid-centers-combat-zones-roads-access-prohibited-rcna210831) (#101994)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 11:29:10+00:00\\n\\n```\\nJune 4, 2025, 7:29 AM EDTRoads leading to Gaza’s aid distribution centers will be considered “combat zones” Wednesday, the Israeli military warned shortly after the controversial organization tasked with running the sites announced they would close for the day. Palestinians would be “prohibited” from entering the centers and traveling on the roads leading to them throughout Wednesday, Avichay Adraee, the Israeli military’s Arabic-language spokesman, said in a post on X on Tuesday, adding that they would be considered “combat zones.” His comments came after the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation — the Israel and U.S.-backed organization overseeing aid distribution in Gaza — said that all distribution centers in the enclave would be closed for “update, organization and efficiency improvement work.” The closures were announced following a string of deadly incidents which saw the Israeli military accused of firing at Palestinians as they sought to collect aid. Health officials in the enclave said dozens of people were killed and hundreds injured. With electricity and internet access limited, it is unclear how many Palestinians will have received the message about both the closures and the fact they could be targeted if they go near the centers after several attacks near the aid sites in recent days.

Video captured by NBC News’ crews on the ground showed bloodied Palestinians being rushed into Nasser Hospital in Gaza’s southern city of Khan Younis.“I hadn’t even reached the distribution point yet when the aircraft opened fire on us. I was hit in both legs,” one of them, Ahmad Hassan Bashnaq, said as he lay on a hospital bed in the hospital’s emergency room. “I only went there to bring food for my children, and I was shot for it,” he added. In a separate interview, Dr. Ahmed Abu Sweid, an Australian emergency physician, said it was “the third such event in the last few days.” Similar incidents were reported by health officials Sunday and Monday with Palestinian health officials reporting dozens killed and hundreds more injured. More than 54,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Oct. 7, 2023, according to health officials in the enclave. Israel launched its offensive in the enclave following the Hamas-led attacks that day, when 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli officials.

They have also suggested it could pose a threat to the independence of humanitarian work. GHF said Tuesday that the Rev. Johnnie Moore, an evangelical leader who has been an adviser to President Donald Trump, had been installed as its executive chairman. His “appointment comes as GHF’s momentum on the ground in Gaza accelerates,” the organization said in a news release Tuesday, adding that since launching operations in the enclave May 26, its team had delivered more than 7 million meals “without incident.” It maintained that there had been “no incidents of violence recorded at distribution sites.” But ahead of its operation in Gaza, GHF’s then-executive director, Jake Wood, quit the organization saying in a statement published by Reuters that it was impossible to implement the plan while also adhering to the “humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence.”Humanitarian groups have warned that while aid has been distributed under GHF, not nearly enough food and other vital supplies are getting into the enclave, which has a population of around 2.1 million, under the new aid system. “The basic needs of the population in Gaza are enormous and are not being met,” Stéphane Dujarric, spokesman for United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said in a statement Tuesday as he called for the “unimpeded entry of humanitarian assistance at scale” to be restored.Chantal Da SilvaChantal Da Silva reports on world news for NBC News Digital and is based in London.Victoria Di Gioacchino contributed.\\n```\\n\\n## [US-backed GHF group extends closure of Gaza aid sites for second day](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/5/us-backed-ghf-group-extends-closure-of-gaza-aid-sites-for-second-day?traffic_source=rss) (#103642)\\n\\n> 2025-06-05 05:10:58+00:00\\n\\n```\\nThe Gaza Humanitarian Foundation claims aid distribution sites have been closed to carry out ‘maintenance’ work.The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) – a shadowy organisation backed by the United States and Israel – will not immediately resume distributing aid in the war-torn territory after a full-day closure on Wednesday, saying that operations will restart when maintenance and repair work on its distribution sites is complete.\\nIn a statement posted on Facebook, the GHF said its “distribution sites will not open as early as” Thursday morning and that it would “share information on opening times as soon as work is complete”.\\nThe GHF also strongly urged aid seekers travelling to its locations to “follow the routes” set by the Israeli military to “ensure safe passage”.\\nThe Israeli military warned Palestinians on Wednesday not to approach GHF aid distribution sites while “reorganisation work” was under way, saying that access roads to those locations would be “considered combat zones”.\\nIsrael’s military has not apparently issued any new directive regarding the safety of the GHF distribution sites as they remain closed for a second day.\\nThe suspension of GHF’s distribution of food supplies in Gaza comes after Israeli forces opened fire on Palestinians seeking aid for a fourth time near a GHF distribution site in Rafah, southern Gaza, early on Tuesday.\\nThe Israeli attack killed at least 27 people and injured about 90 more, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health.\\nOn Sunday, Israeli forces opened fire on thousands of aid seekers near the same site in Rafah, killing at least 31 people and wounding more than 150, according to Gaza’s Civil Defence agency.

Women and children were among the casualties, the group said, with the majority suffering “gunshot or shrapnel wounds”.\\nThe ICRC has also warned that Palestinians in Gaza are facing an “unprecedented scale and frequency of recent mass casualty incidents”.\\nReports of aid seekers being killed by Israeli forces over recent days have led to international outrage, with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres demanding an independent inquiry into the deaths and for “perpetrators to be held accountable”.\\nThe United Kingdom on Wednesday called for an “immediate and independent investigation” into the deadly incidents. UK Middle East Minister Hamish Falconer said the deaths were “deeply disturbing”, and called Israel’s new aid delivery measures “inhumane”.\\nIsrael continues to push ahead with its wider assault on Gaza, with at least 48 people killed in attacks across the Strip on Wednesday, according to Gaza’s Civil Defence.

Gellerson for The New York TimesJune 5, 2025Updated 12:20 a.m. ETAs the world condemned the killings this week of dozens of hungry Palestinians near U.S.-backed aid sites in Gaza, the group responsible for distributing that aid quietly appointed a new leader: an evangelical Christian with ties to the Trump administration.The group, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which was founded last year, announced on Tuesday that Johnnie Moore, an American public relations professional, would be its new executive chairman after the previous chief quit.Mr. Moore’s appointment comes as the foundation — which began handing out food boxes last week — temporarily halted operations on Wednesday to work on “organization and efficiency.” It had been racked by a resignation in its ranks, chaos at its distribution sites and violence nearby, including two shooting episodes in which dozens of Palestinians were killed, according to local health workers.Here is what to know about Mr. Moore and his ties to the Trump administration.ImagePeople carrying boxes and bags containing food and humanitarian aid packages distributed by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation last month in Rafah, in southern Gaza.Credit...Mariam Dagga/Associated PressA presence in the Oval OfficeMr. Moore was a spokesman for Liberty University, the Christian institution founded in Lynchburg, Va., in 1971 by the Rev. Jerry Falwell, for a dozen years before moving into the media industry and starting his own faith-based public relations firm.He represented early evangelical supporters of President Trump, including Jerry Falwell Jr., who succeeded his father at Liberty University, and Paula White, who now leads the White House faith office.Mr. Moore was co-chairman of the 2016 Trump presidential campaign’s evangelical advisory board and an influential figure during Mr. Trump’s first administration. He was part of a coalition of Christian leaders who paid regular visits to the White House, attending policy briefings, as well as prayer meetings in the Oval Office.His public relations company, Kairos, was acquired in 2022 by JDA Worldwide, and Mr. Moore now serves as president of that larger firm. When he announced the acquisition on social media, Mr. Moore referred to his work in public relations as his “day job,” as he has had many other roles and projects linked to his faith and interest in foreign policy, including writing books on the persecution of Christians in the Middle East and Africa.ImageIn 2018, the Trump administration recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Ivanka Trump and others were on hand when the United States Embassy was moved from Tel Aviv Aviv to the city.Credit...Ronen Zvulun/ReutersA faith-based advocate for IsraelIn 2017, Mr. Moore told The New York Times that he and other evangelicals had pressed Mr. Trump to recognize Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem and to move the U.S. Embassy there. “It has been an issue of priority for a long time,” he said.Mr. Moore describes himself as “a bridge builder and peacemaker especially known for consequential work at the intersection of faith and foreign policy, especially in the Middle East.”The embassy move drew condemnation from Palestinian and Arab leaders, the heads of many Christian churches in Jerusalem and much of the international community, which has long viewed the status of Jerusalem as a matter to be resolved through negotiations over a future Palestinian state.A cheerleader for Mike HuckabeeMr. Moore, like many evangelicals, including Mike Huckabee, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, is committed to a Jewish state based on his interpretation of the Bible.Some evangelicals view their support for Israel as an important element of their belief in biblical prophecy. Speaking to The Washington Post in 2018, Mr. Moore said he had advised White House officials that “those who bless Israel will be blessed.”Mr. Moore cheered Mr. Huckabee’s nomination, saying on social media in November that “selecting a lifelong non-Jewish Zionist as the U.S. ambassador to Israel sends a powerful message to friend and foe of America.”Mr. Huckabee, 69, and Mr. Moore, 41, have walked similar paths as public figures and Christian media creators, and they have been described as friends in Israeli news media. The embassy did not respond to a request for comment on their relationship.The new face of a troubled Gaza organizationIsrael imposed a blockade on supplies entering the Gaza Strip in March, accusing Hamas of looting humanitarian aid. That embargo was lifted to a limited degree last month, after the international community raised alarms about widespread hunger in the enclave.Israelis conceived of the new system to establish aid distribution sites run by American security contractors in the enclave. It was meant, officials said, to circumvent Hamas, which Israel accused of stealing assistance meant for civilians.But the rollout of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation’s operation has been chaotic. Its previous head resigned hours before the initiative was set to begin late last month, citing a lack of autonomy. On Tuesday, Boston Consulting Group, a U.S. advisory firm, said that it had stepped back from its involvement with the organization, that it had placed a partner who had worked on the project on leave and that it would conduct an internal review of its work.Humanitarian organizations have criticized the foundation’s approach to aid distribution for a lack of independence from Israel, whose soldiers are positioned near the sites and have fired what the Israeli military has called “warning” shots on multiple occasions. And the United Nations has refused to have anything to do with the effort because it says Israel is militarizing and politicizing humanitarian assistance and putting Palestinians in danger.As reports of disarray at aid distribution sites emerged during the project’s first week, Mr. Moore said the effort was “working” and should be “celebrated.”When the Gazan health authorities reported shooting deaths near one of the foundation’s sites, Mr. Moore reposted a statement from Mr. Huckabee accusing the news media and Hamas of spreading misinformation.Mr. Moore lists 18 years of service with World Help, a Christian humanitarian organization, among his volunteer experiences, along with his new appointment at the Gaza foundation and his roles on various advisory boards, including that of the nonpartisan advocacy group Muslim Coalition for America and Haifa University in Israel.In a statement about his appointment, Mr. Moore said he would help “ensure the humanitarian aid community and the broader international community understand what’s taking place on the ground.” The foundation declined a request for an interview.Ephrat Livni is a reporter for The Times’s DealBook newsletter, based in Washington.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

But after agreeing to exclusive takeover talks with the US private equity company KKR, the debt-laden utility was hoping for a quieter period as it sorted out the details.Those hopes were extinguished on Tuesday after KKR said it was withdrawing its bid – to the shock of Thames Water and its creditors.It is those creditors, some of whom bought Thames’s debt at a big discount in the hope of a quick profit, who have been left – without warning – with the responsibility of pulling together billions of pounds to carry out a turnaround that could take 15 years.Thames Water has been through a tumultuous year already. It had a close shave with bankruptcy, a high court battle to secure £3bn in emergency investment, and several testy parliamentary hearings. It must invest £20bn over the next five years to fix leaking pipes and water treatment works, all while trying to fend off public anger over sewage in Britain’s rivers and seas.KKR balked at the complexity of taking on Thames amid so much scrutiny and with multiple stakeholders in play, according to a person close to the talks. Partners at the private equity firm had carried out 10 weeks of intensive due diligence, including several visits to wastewater treatment works, and had relied on a small army of up to 200 advisers to carry out detailed assessments. The state of some of the Thames assets was worse than KKR had initially thought, according to another source.New York-based KKR, short for Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts, had deployed 15 members of its European infrastructure team, run by the executive Tara Davies, to work on the bid, with James Gordon serving as the lead partner. (Both formerly worked for Macquarie, the Australian investment bank criticised for taking dividends from Thames while building up debt – although they are not thought to have worked on the water company.) Yet over the weekend KKR brought out one of its big guns to try to sweet talk the government: Henry Kravis, one of the co-founders, called up Labour’s business adviser Varun Chandra to discuss the plan. Sky News first reported the call.KKR has rarely been shy of potential controversy, ever since its infamous 1988 buyout of the US conglomerate RJR Nabisco was depicted in the book Barbarians at the Gate. However, several people close to the Thames Water situation have said they believed KKR also became concerned about the political risks associated with it, such as the possibility of intense public scrutiny leading to a stricter approach from the government on enforcement.A government spokesperson said: “The government makes no apology for tackling the poor behaviour we have seen in the past, where too many people were rewarded for failure,” but added: “We welcome investors who want to work with us to rebuild this vital sector and clean up our rivers, lakes and seas.”Ofwat, the water regulator for England and Wales, last week laid down the gauntlet to KKR with £123m in new penalties mostly related to environmental breaches involving sewage spills.KKR’s bid hinged on convincing regulators including Ofwat and the Environment Agency to grant it leniency on fines, penalties and other costs amounting to billions of pounds, as revealed by the Guardian.“There were always going to be three people in the marriage,” wrote Helen Rodriguez, the head of European special situations at CreditSights, a bond rating agency: Thames Water, KKR and Ofwat. KKR may have been put off by “the inevitable drip of more fines to come”, and decided it was not worth going through a month of meetings in June to try to reach a compromise, she added.Thames Water has hired its own army of advisers, including the law firm Linklaters. It is understood the Linklaters lawyers involved have included Alison Saunders, formerly the UK’s director of public prosecutions, and Jonathan Jones, a former head of the government’s legal department. Saunders has previously acted for Southern Water on a criminal investigation, while Jones acted for the energy company Bulb during its special administration. Linklaters declined to comment.Keir Starmer’s office received a courtesy call from KKR before the announcement. The government is hoping to avoid involvement.The environment secretary, Steve Reed, told parliament on Tuesday there remained “a market-led solution on the table” as he categorically ruled out a permanent nationalisation.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionHowever, Reed acknowledged that the government was ready to put Thames Water into a special administration regime – akin to a temporary nationalisation – if required.Yet the “market-led solution” leaves the government with the prospect of the UK’s biggest water company being owned by a group of creditors that includes US hedge funds – such as Elliott Investment Management and Silver Point Capital – which are known for controversial tactics, as well as big institutional investors such as Aberdeen, BlackRock, Invesco and M&G. It is an unwieldy group of 100 companies, holding £13bn in Thames Water bonds. The investment bank Jefferies is acting as the group’s main financial adviser.Despite the financial pressure Thames is under – and the cash burn required to fund its operations – the water company has covered the costs of as much as £15m for due diligence checks that KKR spent on exploring the state of the vast business. Much of that information has already been shared with the creditor group, and will now be used to inform their talks with Ofwat.However, the creditors must race to secure a deal as Thames burns through the first £1.5bn of the emergency cash it borrowed to fund its day-to-day operations.Like KKR before it, the creditor group will also try to reach an accommodation with Ofwat that will reduce the scope for big fines that would threaten to wipe out their financial returns. The new owners would look to install a board with more water industry experience. The position of Thames Water’s chief executive, Chris Weston, is unclear.“The creditors believe that Thames Water requires an urgent and fundamental reset and there is a very short and closing window in which a market-led solution can succeed,” a spokesperson for the lenders said. “Discussions with Ofwat and the government will be advanced in the coming weeks to reach an agreement and turnaround for the benefit of customers and the environment.”Even if yet another deal on Thames Water can be reached, people involved in the crisis noted the irony of the timing of KKR’s decision: it was announced just as an interim government review highlighted “deep-rooted, systemic” problems in England and Wales’s privatised water industry.\\n```\\n\\n## [Northumbrian Water to pay out £15.7m after sewage and water network failings](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/environment/ofwat-b1231284.html) (#99513)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 16:46:51+00:00\\n\\n```\\nNorthumbrian Water has agreed to pay out £15.7 million after failures in the maintenance and operations of its sewage and water network.Water sector regulator Ofwat said the firm will pay out the “enforcement package” to local environmental causes and improvements to the region’s water infrastructure.Bosses at the watchdog said its failures led to “excessive spills from storm overflows”.It comes a week after Thames Water was fined a record £122.7 million after it was found to have broken rules over sewage treatment and paying out dividends.Ofwat said the enforcement package is “greater than the penalty which would otherwise have been imposed” if it had fined the business.It also said the package agreed with the company means it will be spent on local improvements for customers, rather than being directed to the Treasury’s consolidated fund.Northumbrian Water chief executive Heidi Mottram said: “We agree with Ofwat’s announcement that the financial settlement will be directed into speeding up our storm overflow reduction plans and in meaningful local initiatives via our Branch Out fund.“This investment, which will come entirely from Northumbrian Water shareholders and will not be paid for by customers’ bills, will enhance our ongoing efforts to support local communities and protect and improve the natural environment here in the North East.”Lynn Parker, senior director for enforcement at Ofwat, said: “Our investigation has found failures in how Northumbrian Water has operated and maintained some of its sewage works and networks, which has resulted in excessive spills from storm overflows.“The contraventions we have found at some of their sites will have had an impact on the local environment and customers and it is unacceptable.“We are pleased that Northumbrian Water has agreed this package.“We now expect them to move at pace to correct the issues our investigation has identified.“We hope more companies will follow this example so that the public sees transformative change across the sector.”Northumbrian Water said in December last year that it plans to increase its average water bills by around 21% over the next five years.\\n```\\n\\n## [HMRC has lost £47 million in breach of 100,000 taxpayer accounts, MPs hear](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/treasury-committee-mps-people-uk-parliament-david-hughes-b1231280.html) (#99514)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 16:44:30+00:00\\n\\n```\\nHMRC has lost £47 million after a phishing scam breached tens of thousands of tax accounts, a group of MPs has heard.Two senior civil servants at HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) told the Treasury Committee that 100,000 people have been contacted, or are in the process of being contacted, after their accounts were locked down in what they said was an “organised crime” incident which began last year.Taxpayers who are being affected will suffer “no financial loss”, according to John-Paul Marks, the chief executive of HMRC, the UK’s tax authority.Mr Marks told the Committee: “It’s about 0.2% of the PAYE population, around 100,000 people, who we have written to, are writing to, to notify them that we detected activity on their PAYE account.”Asked if this applied to individual working people’s PAYE accounts, not companies, he replied: “That’s right, individuals. To be clear, no financial loss to those individuals.Mr Marks added: “This was organised crime phishing for identity data outwith of HMRC systems, so stuff that banks and others will also unfortunately experience, and then trying to use that data to create PAYE accounts to pay themselves a repayment and/or access an existing account.”An investigation into the matter, which took place last year “including jurisdictions outside the UK”, led to “some arrests last year,” Mr Marks told MPs.Angela MacDonald, HMRC’s deputy chief executive and second permanent secretary, added: “At the moment, they’ve managed to extract repayments to the tune of £47 million.“Now that is a lot of money, and it’s very unacceptable.“We have overall, in the last tax year, we actually protected £1.9 billion worth of money which sought to be taken from us by attacks.”Ms MacDonald stressed the breach was “not a cyber attack, we have not been hacked, we have not had data extracted from us”.She later added: “The ability for somebody to breach your systems and to extract data, to hold you to ransomware and all of those things, that is a cyber attack. That is not what has happened here.”HMRC said it had locked down affected accounts and deleted log-in details to prevent future unauthorised access.Any incorrect information has been removed from tax records and officials have checked to ensure no other details have been changed.People affected will receive a letter from HMRC over the next three weeks.HMRC’s chief civil servant John-Paul Marks appearing at the Treasury Committee, where MPs heard about a phishing breach which has cost £47 million. (UK Parliament/Parliament TV)Elsewhere, Mr Marks told MPs that HMRC phone lines were down on Wednesday afternoon, but said this was “coincidental”.They will be “back up and available in the morning”, he added.An HMRC spokesperson said: “We’ve acted to protect customers after identifying attempts to access a very small minority of tax accounts, and we’re working with other law enforcement agencies both in the UK and overseas to bring those responsible to justice.“This was not a cyber-attack – it involved criminals using personal information from phishing activity or data obtained elsewhere to try to claim money from HMRC.“We’re writing to those customers affected to reassure them we’ve secured their accounts and that they haven’t lost any money.”\\n```\\n\\n## [Police launch investigation into heart operation deaths at NHS hospital](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cev404npy4po) (#100856)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 05:01:31+00:00\\n\\n```\\n1 day agoMichael BuchananSocial affairs correspondent, BBC NewsBBCChristine Rymer says she had no idea what her mother, Dorothy Readhead, had endured until she was contacted by the BBCPolice have launched an investigation into the deaths of patients following heart operations at an NHS hospital, the BBC has learned.Documents seen by us suggest patients suffered avoidable harm - and that in some cases their death certificates failed to disclose that the procedure contributed to their deaths.One woman\\'s operation at Castle Hill Hospital near Hull - that should have taken no more than two hours - has been described as a \"disaster\" by one medic.She spent six hours in surgery and lost five litres of blood - all while under local anesthetic.But none of this was mentioned on her death certificate, which recorded her as dying from pneumonia. Her family were also not told what had happened.The NHS body that runs Castle Hill, the Humber Health Care Partnership, told the BBC it had delivered improvements suggested by the Royal College of Physicians (RCP). In a statement, it said it was happy to directly answer any questions from the patients\\' families.Humberside Police said an investigation was \"in the very early stages\" and no arrests had been made.\\'Very concerned about safety\\'The documents raise concerns about the care that 11 patients received during a TAVI - Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implant - a procedure to replace a damaged valve in the heart, similar to adding a stent.The department\\'s TAVI mortality rate at the time was three times higher than the UK average, something patients and families were also unaware of.Staff concerns within the hospital led managers to commission several reviews - but none was made public. In 2020, the RCP was asked to assess the whole cardiology department, in which the TAVI team was operating, including two of the TAVI deaths.That report, completed in 2021, led to a second review conducted by consultants IQ4U, which recommended a third review of all 11 deaths, which was also conducted by the Royal College and completed in early 2024.The BBC has been passed copies of all three inquiries. The patients\\' families only found out they had taken place when we contacted them.Also in 2021, seven cardiac consultants wrote they were \"very concerned about the safety and transparency of the TAVI service\" in a letter to the hospital\\'s chief executive. It followed the deaths, in less than six months, of four of the 11 patients.Used instead of open-heart surgery, the TAVI procedure involves inserting a new valve via a catheter through a blood vessel, often in the groin. The catheter guides the new valve to the heart and replaces the damaged one.The procedure, which typically lasts between one and two hours, is usually carried out under local anaesthetic and is mainly performed on older patients.Dorothy Readhead, from Driffield, went to Castle Hill to undergo a TAVI in summer 2020. The 87-year-old, an active member of her local church and a keen gardener, had been suffering bouts of breathlessness which doctors had blamed on a heart condition.Deemed not suitable for open-heart surgery, Mrs Readhead was keen to take up the option of the less-invasive procedure. \"She thought it would give her a [better] quality of life,\" says her daughter, Christine Rymer.But the operation went wrong.The care Mrs Readhead received formed part of both RCP reviews carried out on behalf of the hospital trust.Pre-op checks had indicated Mrs Readhead\\'s left side was to be used for the TAVI, as her right side had some blockages because of calcified arteries.The manufacturer of the TAVI device that was to be implanted had also written a technical report clearly stating that access via the patient\\'s right artery was unsuitable.On the day of the operation however, the TAVI medics went in through Mrs Readhead\\'s right leg by mistake. Realising their error, they paused to consider their options but decided to continue - despite the procedure being an elective rather than an emergency operation.They attempted to deploy the TAVI three times.The repeated efforts resulted in a significant tear in Mrs Readhead\\'s femoral artery, a major blood vessel. By now, she had been on the surgical table for six hours, lost five litres of blood, and had been awake throughout.Mrs Readhead\\'s care was \"graded poor\" by the RCP in its 2021 report. It concluded this because of the use of an \"inappropriate access site\" during a procedure, stating this \"unfortunately resulted in an avoidable vascular complication\".The TAVI team\\'s decisions \"resulted in a disaster for this patient\", an anaesthetist called in to rescue the situation wrote two days after the operation in an email - seen by the BBC.He described it as \"a change of plan without weighing the risks vs benefit for the patient, but having a \\'have a go\\' approach\".Dr Thanjavur Bragadeesh, then-clinical director of the cardiac unit, suggested the case should be declared a serious incident (SI) when he was made aware of it a few days later. This would mean a full investigation by the hospital.But this suggestion was initially rejected by the vascular surgeon who had been part of the TAVI team.\"These were recognised complications which were anticipated as of significant risk... The aim of the [forthcoming] meeting is to celebrate and reinforce what went well,\" he wrote in an email.The head of the TAVI team, agreed, replying it was \"an unfortunate but well recognised complication\".The hospital did, however, investigate Mrs Readhead\\'s case as a serious incident. While it noted that her death, a week after the operation, provided areas for learning, \"these would not have prevented the incident from occurring\". It concluded the team had \"worked collaboratively and well together\".This conclusion was shared with Mrs Readhead\\'s family, with no mention of the TAVI manufacturer\\'s warning or the failure to deploy the device on three attempts.Mrs Readhead\\'s death certificate also makes no mention of the procedure.Her cause of death is listed as \"hospital-acquired pneumonia and severe aortic stenosis\" - the condition the hospital had been attempting to treat.However, the second RCP review in 2024 strongly disagreed with the death certificate wording.\"The vascular injury during the TAVI procedure should have been detailed, as this led to the patient\\'s death,\" it says.Mrs Readhead\\'s daughter says she had no idea what her mother had endured until the BBC showed her the documentation.\"None of that was told to us. None of it,\" says Christine Rymer. \"It just feels as if mum was a guinea pig, which is not nice to think about.\"The 2024 review looked at the deaths of 11 patients in total - seven women and four men who all had TAVI procedures, including Mrs Readhead. Ten deaths occurred between October 2019 and March 2022 - the other happened in May 2023.The review\\'s findings included:\"Poor clinical decision-making\" at every stage of the treatment of a male patient, aged 73 - including incorrect positioning of the TAVI valveThe same patient\\'s final death certificate failing to contain an \"an accurate description\" of what happened. He was issued with two certificates - the first one mentioning a \"failed TAVI\" was withdrawn, while a second one weeks later stated he died from pneumonia and didn\\'t mention the TAVICriticism of death certificates issued to two other patients, both women who died within six weeks of each other, saying crucial details were missing, making them inaccurateNo mitigation for a female patient, aged 84, who had an \"elevated risk\" - which led to a complication \"that might have been avoided under more experienced operators\"The BBC has also seen the 2021 letter from the \"very concerned\" cardiac consultants to the hospital\\'s chief executive, Chris Long, and chief medical officer, Dr Purva Makani.Highlighting one death that year, the consultants said they had been \"alarmed to read\" that the coroner had not been informed of a serious complication during the operation, with the cause of death recorded as a heart attack.Dr Bragadeesh, who was one of the signatories, says he believes the TAVI service at Castle Hill should have been suspended at that time because the mortality rate was so high compared to most other UK hospitals.Former fisherman Brian Hunter, from Grimsby, was another of the 11 patients who died. He had faith in the NHS, say his family, although rarely visited a doctor.He lived by the maxim that \"a hot curry or a paracetamol\" would cure all ailments - and \"if that didn\\'t work you, you just got on with it,\" according to his daughter, Tracy Fisher.His diagnosis of a heart problem therefore, at the age of 83, shocked his four daughters. But they and Brian were reassured a TAVI procedure would soon allow him to resume his gardening and cooking his Sunday roasts.However, there was \"a lack of urgency\" to treat him, according to the 2024 RCP review - and by the time he underwent the operation, in October 2021, he was \"a high-risk case… with an increased risk of complication and little margin for error\".\"To find out three years down the line that what your father actually passed from wasn\\'t the truth is torturous,\" says Tracy FisherThe TAVI team had made technical errors, concluded the review, failing to properly deploy the device which then wrongly allowed blood to leak back into the heart.Mr Hunter didn\\'t survive the operation - the Royal College graded his care as \"very poor\". His daughters - just like Dorothy Readhead\\'s family - had no idea what had happened during his operation until we showed them the report.\"We were led to believe that dad had a heart attack on the table and unfortunately passed away,\" said Mrs Fisher. \"To find out three years down the line that what your father actually passed from wasn\\'t the truth is torturous.\"I feel angry as well, and so does the rest of the family, that [the hospital] just outrageously lied. At no point do any of us find it acceptable. It\\'s just not.\"Dr Thanjavur Bragadeesh raised concerns about the TAVI procedure at Castle Hill HospitalAfter raising concerns about Mrs Readhead\\'s case in 2020, Dr Bragadeesh was asked to step down from his role as clinical director of Castle Hill Hospital\\'s cardiology department as part of a wider leadership reorganisation.When the rationale for the reorganisation was challenged, the trust asked the RCP to conduct its 2021 review, including assessing whether the decision to change the management team and his role was correct.There were poor working relationships within the cardiology department, found the RCP at that time, with reviewers adding that they \"positively acknowledge the decision to step down the cardiology leadership roles\".Dr Bragadeesh continued to work at Castle Hill but took the trust to an employment tribunal.In December 2023, the tribunal dismissed three of his 29 complaints and said of the remaining 26 that they were out of time, concluding he should have brought his case earlier.He now works at a different NHS trust. He says the failures identified in the 2024 Royal College of Physicians review \"show I was right to raise concerns about the TAVI procedure\".The Humber Health Care Partnership - which runs Castle Hill through Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust (HUTH) - said in a statement: \"We understand families may have questions and we are happy to answer those directly.\"It said that following a 2021 review, the RCP concluded the TAVI service was essential for the region, but said the design of the service should be reviewed and invested in.\"The report offered a number of actions for improvement and we have delivered against all of those since it was shared with us,\" it said.It said its services retained the confidence of the healthcare inspector, the Care Quality Commission.The trust added that three separate external reviews had been undertaken \"and shown that mortality rates associated with TAVI are similar to national mortality rates over a four-year period\".The mortality data it shared with the BBC indicates that the unit remains above the UK national average.Additional reporting by Tara Mewawalla\\n```\\n\\n## [Police investigate heart surgery patient deaths at East Yorkshire hospital](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jun/04/police-investigate-heart-surgery-patient-deaths-at-east-yorkshire-hospital) (#100891)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 17:24:08+00:00\\n\\n```\\nPolice have launched an investigation into the deaths of heart surgery patients at an East Yorkshire hospital.The investigation is focusing on transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) procedures carried out on elderly and frail patients at Castle Hill hospital, near Hull.There have been no arrests in connection with the investigation, which Humberside police said was in its “very early stages”.A BBC investigation found concerns had been raised about the deaths of 11 patients after the procedure to replace a damaged valve in the heart.It is a surgery used in people with heart disease who are not well enough for major heart surgery, as the heart does not need to be stopped, unlike in bypass surgery.However it does still carry serious risk as it involves surgeons inserting an instrument with a balloon into a leg or chest artery, which is moved into position near the opening of the aortic valve. Space for new tissue is then created by inflating the balloon, which supports the heart valve.The Humber Health Care Partnership, which runs Castle Hill through Hull university teaching hospitals NHS trust (HUTH), told the BBC that three separate reviews, conducted after concerns were raised, had found that deaths after this type of surgery at the hospital were in line with the national average.It said families who had lost loved ones were invited to ask questions and that the trust was “happy to answer those directly”.The spokesperson said: “Three separate external reviews of our TAVI service have been undertaken and shown that mortality rates associated with TAVI are similar to national mortality rates over a four-year period.“The Royal College of Physicians was invited to review the service in 2021, at the request of the trust’s chief medical officer. The Royal College report concluded that the TAVI service is essential for the Humber and North Yorkshire region and needs to be expanded.“It stated, however, that the design of the service should be reviewed and invested in. The report offered a number of actions for improvement and we have delivered against all of those since it was shared with us.”A Humberside police spokesperson said: “An investigation is in the very early stages in relation to deaths following surgery at Castle Hill hospital. Inquiries are being carried out and at this time, we can confirm no arrests have been made.”\\n```\\n\\n## [Police investigate after 11 patients die at NHS hospital during routine heart surgery - including...](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14778841/investigation-common-procedure-11-deaths-operating-table.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490) (#101153)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 15:21:20+00:00\\n\\n```\\nPolice investigate after 11 patients die at NHS hospital during routine heart surgery - including one woman who lost five litres of blood in \\'disaster\\' op\\n10:18, 04 Jun 2025, updated\\n16:21, 04 Jun 2025\\nBy\\nZOE HARDY\\nREAD MORE: The truth about CT scans - studies prove they cause cancer\\nPolice have launched an urgent probe into the practices of surgeons at a hospital in Yorkshire, following the death of 11 patients after routine heart operations.The BBC said today documents suggest that patients treated at Castle Hill Hospital suffered avoidable harm—which medics failed to disclose on their death certificates.The documents raise alarm bells about the care of patients who underwent surgery for a transcatheter aortic valve implant (TAVI)—a common procedure to replace a damaged valve.\\xa0This operation usually takes around two hours, but one woman spent six hours in surgery, over the course of which she lost five litres of blood under local anesthetic.Her procedure has been described as a \\'disaster\\'.This ordeal was not mentioned on her death certificate, which simply stated she died of\\xa0pneumonia. Her family were also not informed of the complications.\\xa0The police investigation is still in the very early stages and no arrests have been made.\\xa0After staff raised concerned that the department\\'s TAVI mortality rate was scarily high—three times that of the UK average—managers commissioned reviews to try and work out what was going wrong.\\xa0 TAVI, first performed on the NHS in 2007, is safer and less invasive than conventional surgery, but often more expensive.

To be clear, no financial loss to those individuals.”He added: “This was organised crime phishing for identity data outwith of HMRC systems, so stuff that banks and others will also unfortunately experience, and then trying to use that data to create PAYE accounts to pay themselves a repayment and/or access an existing account.”An investigation into the matter, which took place last year “including jurisdictions outside the UK”, led to “some arrests last year”, Marks told MPs.Angela MacDonald, HMRC’s deputy chief executive and second permanent secretary, added: “At the moment, they’ve managed to extract repayments to the tune of £47m. Now that is a lot of money, and it’s very unacceptable.“We have overall, in the last tax year, we actually protected £1.9bn worth of money which sought to be taken from us by attacks.”MacDonald stressed the breach was “not a cyber-attack, we have not been hacked, we have not had data extracted from us”.She later added: “The ability for somebody to breach your systems and to extract data, to hold you to ransomware and all of those things, that is a cyber-attack. That is not what has happened here.”HMRC said it had locked down affected accounts and deleted login details to prevent future unauthorised access.Any incorrect information has been removed from tax records and officials have checked to ensure no other details have been changed.People affected will receive a letter from HMRC over the next three weeks.Marks also told MPs that HMRC phone lines were down on Wednesday afternoon but said this was “coincidental”, adding they will be “back up and available” on Thursday.An HMRC spokesperson said: “We’ve acted to protect customers after identifying attempts to access a very small minority of tax accounts, and we’re working with other law enforcement agencies both in the UK and overseas to bring those responsible to justice.“This was not a cyber-attack – it involved criminals using personal information from phishing activity or data obtained elsewhere to try to claim money from HMRC.“We’re writing to those customers affected to reassure them we’ve secured their accounts and that they haven’t lost any money.”Last week, UK banks and payment firms were urged to strengthen their anti-fraud systems for international payments after a rise in scammers tricking people into sending money abroad.New figures revealed that international payments accounted for 11% of authorised push payment scams losses in 2024 – almost double the 2023 figure.\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

David Monias has watched the air in his traditional territory mutate from tints of yellow to an ominous reddish brown over the last week. Beset by fires spreading from island to island near Cross Lake, he has waved goodbye to hundreds of Pimicikamak members fleeing on military planes, helicopters, ferries, buses and shuttles – including many of his own family.“So many of my people are leaving the reserves for the first time ever. None of us know when they can come back,” Mr. Monias told The Globe and Mail. “Without any rain on the horizon, we have no idea when any of this will end.”More than 200 wildfires were burning across the country Tuesday, with at least 104 deemed out of control and 14 that had started from the day prior.Smoke from wildfires burning in three provinces is spreading into the U.S. Upper Midwest, stirring memories of the severe pollution that drifted south from Canada two years ago during its worst fire season on record.ReutersThe flames ran rampant mostly in Western Canada, where Manitoba and Saskatchewan have now ordered evacuations for around 30,000 people, many in larger towns and cities, with both provinces under states of emergency.Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe said the number of evacuees is going to significantly increase this week, telling reporters in Prince Albert: “We are in the fight for our very communities.”Having lived his whole life in the affected region, Mr. Moe became emotional explaining the severity of the situation. “I’ve never seen anything, like, in the way of the ferocity of the fires, how quickly they’re moving, how they’re changing,” he said. “Every few days, the wind shifts direction and threatens a community in a different way.”Wildfire smoke map: Which parts of Canada are under air quality warnings?The province is contending with 21 active wildfires, eight of which are uncontained, with 230 recorded this year – well over its five-year annual average of 132. Officials from the Saskatchewan Public Safety Agency said wildfire behaviour has been so extreme since Monday that crews have had to stop firefighting efforts repeatedly, at times fleeing for their own safety. The number of displaced people in Saskatchewan reached at least 9,000 registered residents by Tuesday. On top of that, the Premier said around 7,000 people surrounding the town of La Ronge, Sask., its nearby airport and the Lac La Ronge Indian Band are being evacuated this week – adding to the 8,000 other people who have already been asked to vacate their properties. “They aren’t just buildings. These are places where they have raised their family,” he said, as officials estimated more than 400 structures have been destroyed. “Many families are leaving their home and they don’t know if they’re going to see it again.”National strategy to fight wildfires needed, fire chiefs saySaskatchewan is preparing to send evacuees to other provinces as needed.In Manitoba, around 18,000 people have now been evacuated. The province is responding to 27 active wildfires, with a risk of more to come later in the week.Large arenas and soccer fields in Winnipeg have been converted into shelters, with other emergency spaces also set up in Brandon, Thompson, Portage la Prairie and Winkler, Man.But as Manitoba struggles to find lodgings, hundreds of evacuees are being sent more than 2,000 kilometres away to Niagara Falls, Ont. – including from Pimicikamak, Mathias Colomb Cree Nation and other smaller communities near Pukatawagan and The Pas.

Right now, we literally only have one fire truck and barely any water pumps,” Mr. Monias said. “Our bureaucratic process moves too slow for a crisis like this, and it feels like saving our homes here doesn’t matter.”Kurtis Ferland, who arrived in Niagara Falls from Pukatawagan on the weekend, said he is just grateful for a warm bed and meal. “I was able to bring really nothing with me,” he said Tuesday. “But being able to sleep in peace is all I could ever ask for.” Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre spokesperson Awa Cissé confirmed Tuesday that between 140 to 150 firefighters from the United States will arrive this week, expected to be primarily in Manitoba and Alberta.Grappling with more than 50 active wildfires, Alberta has called back its own firefighters this week, many of whom were previously being sent to other parts of the country. The province has evacuated around 5,000 people.In British Columbia, meanwhile, there were at least 68 wildfires Tuesday, with one evacuation order triggered around the Kiskatinaw River area near the B.C.-Alberta border, and another wildfire north of Fort Nelson shutting down the Alaska Highway. Officials expect more fires in the southeast and northeast regions.With a report from Emily Haws in Ottawa\\n```\\n\\n## [Wildfire smoke maps: Haze spreads across Mass. and New England](https://naturaldisasters.einnews.com/article/819023577/TtFcrS2uPhoZalDx?ref=rss&ecode=5DCHg6ojdayQpKlr) (#100045)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 16:32:54+00:00\\n\\n```\\nSmoky skies continue to block out some of the radiant sunshine across New England Wednesday as Canadian wildfire smoke wafts across the region.

Meanwhile, smoke from wildfires in Canada is being pushed to the U.S. The haze is affecting air quality across a significant portion of the country, reaching the Gulf, including Florida.The air quality forecast from AirNow, an Environmental Protection Agency site, says Mississippi is under a moderate air quality index for June 4.Here\\'s what to know about the next few days of summer weather in Mississippi, and how you can prepare for lower air quality.Why is smoke from Canada blowing into Mississippi?As of June 3, more than 200 wildfires were burning in Canada. More than half were out of control, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.Thousands of people have been evacuated, and some firefighters from the U.S. are going to help in Alberta and Manitoba.Smoke has affected air quality in the northern and central U.S. for days, and several states have issued air quality alerts.As of June 3, the smoke had drifted south and east, reaching the Eastern Coast as far south as Florida.What can Mississippi expect from the smoke?According to the National Weather Service in Jackson, most of the smoke has stayed high in the atmosphere, but it can reach the surface at night. The smoke could cause vibrant sunrises and sunsets but shouldn\\'t be a cause for concern at ground level.The smoke will stay through at least midweek.A forecast created by firesmoke.ca shows Mississippi getting a more solid smoke covering on June 4 and 5.What to know about Saharan dustA massive plume is set to spread over Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas and Alabama around the middle of the week.An AccuWeather forecast shows it hitting Florida on June 4 and pushing over to the Magnolia State by June 6.The dust waves will keep coming all summer. Also known as the Saharan Air Layer, the annual weather phenomenon can help dampen hurricanes. It brings stellar sunsets and sunrises to the U.S. and can affect air quality.What is Saharan dust?Just like the name sounds like, dust and dirt from the Sahara Desert in Africa.According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the dry, dusty air forms over the arid region from spring through autumn. Tradewinds can catch the dust, pushing a 2-2.5 mile thick layer in the atmosphere about a mile above the ground or ocean.How long does the Saharan dust last?According to NOAA, it\\'s common for Saharan dust to cross the Atlantic to the Western hemisphere. In the U.S., bands will hit about every three to five days.It usually starts around June, and the strongest activity is from June to the middle of August.How does smoke, Saharan dust affect people? Can it cause coughing?Yes. Smoke and Saharan dust can affect air quality. Both can trigger coughing and sinus issues for some people, especially if the coverage is thick. If you\\'re concerned, use a mask outside and an air purifier with a filter indoors.People with asthma or other health issues affected by air quality might want to stay inside as much as possible when the dust is heavy in your area.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines Saharan dust as a form of particulate pollution. It\\'s made of sand and minerals, but it\\'s not the same kind of dust as the household variety with dust mites.Smoke also has small particles that can cause eye to burn, respiratory inflammation and damage the heart and lungs. It can cause headaches and bronchitis.Does Saharan dust stop hurricanes?Sort of. It can suppress the energy needed for hurricanes to form and intensify. It\\'s more like starving a storm than making one stop in its tracks automatically.Large amounts of dust can keep the surface of the ocean slightly cooler, which can help prevent storms from growing or forming.According to the National Weather Service, the lower humidity and warm, dry air can also weaken an existing storm with downdrafts or throw off the heat signature of a cyclone.See where wildfires are burning in US, CanadaContributing: Jeanine SantucciBonnie Bolden is the Deep South Connect reporter for Mississippi with Gannett/USA Today.

As a precaution, Manitoba parks were advised to prepare for potential evacuations.\\nCanada\\'s wildfire season typically begins in April and lasts until late September, with most activity occurring in June and July. In recent years, however, it has started as early as February, due to warmer weather and drier conditions.Smoke from the wildfires has been impacting air quality in several U.S. states, including Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. The smoke had reached parts of western Europe, too, according to climate monitoring services.\"Smoke originating from the wildfires in the Canadian provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan has been transported across the Atlantic, reaching Europe during the last few days with forecasts showing further smoke transport this week,\" according to a statement published Tuesday by the European Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS).Firefighters, emergency crews and aircraft from other provinces, and from the U.S., were on their way to help fight the wildfires in Canada.\"I\\'ve never seen anything like it, in the way of the ferocity of the fires, how quickly they\\'re moving, how they\\'re changing and encroaching on communities,\" Moe, the Saskatchewan premier whose home is lives close to some of the active fires, said according to national broadcaster CBC.\\nWhile Alberta was seeing a slightly improved picture, in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, the forecast for the coming days was for strong winds and no precipitation, meaning little expected relief for the teams battling the fires.Canada faced its worst wildfire season on record in 2023.

Two of the vans were driven by detectives wearing masks to hide their identity.Police are expected to continue the search for the third day on Thursday.Madeleine\\'s case was initially handled by the Portuguese authorities with the aid of the Metropolitan Police, but German investigators took the lead in 2020, when they identified German national Christian Brückner as their prime suspect.The 48-year-old is currently serving a sentence in Germany for the rape of a 72-year-old American tourist in Portugal in 2005. He is due to be released in September, but that could be pushed back to early 2026 if he does not pay a fine he owes.The search site - which covers the municipality of Lagos near to Praia da Luz - is located around 3.5 miles from the Ocean Club resort, where Madeleine and her family had been staying.PA MediaInvestigators have been scouring scrubland and abandoned buildings in the latest searches for Madeleine McCannOn Wednesday morning, many vehicles carrying dozens of people in uniform and plain clothes arrived on the site, which is focused on the edge of the town of Atalaia. Many of them had their faces covered.Search teams wearing protective gear could be seen using a digger to remove rubble from one of the disused buildings.Roads leading up to the area - which is large and mostly scrubland - have been closed since Monday.A Portuguese fire engine and four vehicles carrying German police were seen arriving on the scene on Tuesday. Firefighters also drained a well as part of the search.The focus on the first day of the search was on what appears to be an abandoned farm with many derelict and graffitied buildings, empty bottles and litter.ReutersAuthorities have been looking at various abandoned buildings as part of the searchA white van and large blue tent can be seen a short distance from what looks to be an old farmhouse, the base of search operations.The area is in the middle of a tourist region.A few hundred metres north is a golf club and resort, while in the opposite direction are some steep cliffs leading to the sea. Along the cliffs, is a hiking trail along the cliffs known as Trilho dos Pescadores, or the Fisherman\\'s trail. The last search took place two years ago and was focused around a reservoir to the north-east of where the British toddler was staying. Brückner, who spent time in the area between 2000 and 2017, was found to have photographs and videos of himself near the reservoir.German authorities suspect Brückner of murder and fear that if he is not charged with anything new he will disappear following his release. British police continue to treat the case as a missing persons investigation.Brückner has repeatedly denied any involvement.PA MediaGerman police have a European warrant, which has been approved by Portuguese prosecutors, will allow them to conduct searches on private land. This week\\'s search is expected to span across 21 different plots of land.Officials have not disclosed if they are conducting this latest search in Portugal based on any new information, making it appear as if they are taking one last look in places where evidence or a body could have been hiddenPortuguese authorities have also named Brückner as a formal suspect, or \"arguido\".

These cliffs hide the strip of gorse scrubland which runs east to the larger resort of Lagos, and are dotted with derelict, abandoned agricultural buildings and houses, marked with missing roofs and chipped plaster.The cliff path that makes its way over the cliffs from Praia da Luz to Lagos is the last stage of Portugal\\'s famous Trilho dos Pescadores (Fishermen\\'s Trail).This week, with the weather pleasantly cool, hundreds of tourists are walking the trail, but all the tracks running north are closed off with police tape.Because once again detectives are searching for clues as to what happened to Madeleine McCann, the three-year-old British girl who went missing in May 2007, making the little seaside resort of Praia Da Luz famous for all the wrong reasons.Less than a mile from where she disappeared, press photographers with long lenses trying to get pictures are playing cat and mouse with officers from the Polícia Judiciária - the Portuguese equivalent of the FBI.How can it be that 18 years on, this beauty spot dotted with ruined buildings, is being searched again? How was it not searched more thoroughly at the time?Madeleine\\'s disappearance and the stories always accompanied by pictures of her with blonde hair and large eyes, have made news around the world for almost two decades now. But the story of the police investigations is a pitiful one.When she first disappeared her parents struggled to get the Portuguese authorities to take it seriously, turning to the media to make appeals for anyone who might have seen her. The apartment from which she vanished while her parents were having a meal at a nearby restaurant on the holiday complex was not properly sealed off, so vital forensic clues were lost. Searches at the time were not rigorous and seemed unstructured. For a while, her own parents Gerry and Kate McCann fell under suspicion.On and off tensions between the Portuguese and British police ran through those early years. From 2011, the Metropolitan Police took the lead, spending more than £13m. Fresh searches took place in 2014 but it seemed that time had obscured any evidence that might lead to the person responsible for her abduction.Then in 2020, everything changed when prosecutors in Braunschweig, Germany, and officers from the BKA (Bundeskriminalamt) - the German equivalent of the FBI - said they had a suspect. Not just a suspect for the disappearance of Madeleine, but a suspect for her murder - a word never used by the British police.It became clear that their suspect is Christian Brückner, who was jailed in Germany in 2019 for raping an elderly American woman in Portugal in 2005. A drifter and petty criminal, he had spent much of his time between 2000 and 2017 in the Algarve.The Braunschweig prosecutors, led by Hans Christian Wolters, believe Brückner may have committed many more sexual offences in Portugal. But he was acquitted at a trial last year of three counts of rape and two counts of sexually assaulting children. Through his lawyers he has also adamantly denied any link to Madeleine.The publicly-known evidence against him is based on comments he is alleged to have made to a friend about Madeleine\\'s death, and on the fact a phone linked to him was in Praia da Luz on the night she disappeared.It now seems that there was some data available to the Portuguese police all along about who might have been in the town that night. Data that could have been mapped against known criminals, and that might have led to more targeted searches in 2007 or the years that followed.But as we stand on the Trilho dos Pescadores watching the German detectives searching through ruined buildings and old wells for Madeleine\\'s body or anything that might give some clues to her disappearance, it all feels like it is 18 years too late.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

But within hours of arriving, he disappeared in circumstances that his family and friends describe as \\'completely out of character.\\'Last Confirmed SightingHis last confirmed sighting was at 3:27am on Wednesday, captured on CCTV walking alone in the Cerro da Águia area — a quiet, residential hill located more than an hour\\'s walk from the bustling Albufeira Strip, where he had last been seen drinking with friends. The location is also nearly 30 minutes\\' walk from his accommodation at Novochoro Apartments.Greg\\'s sister Jillian Monks, who has led the public appeal for help, said the family has been overwhelmed by the support from the British expat community and locals alike, but confirmed there have been no sightings or updates as of Tuesday. \"This is so unlike Greg and we are truly desperate for answers,\" she wrote on Facebook. She has appealed to residents in Cerro da Águia to check home security and doorbell footage between 2am and 5am last Wednesday.Similarities With Madelein McCannGreg\\'s disappearance echoes the high-profile case of Madeleine McCann, who vanished from Praia da Luz — just over 30 miles from Albufeira — in 2007. While the circumstances are vastly different, the renewed spotlight on a British tourist missing in the Algarve has unnerved many and raised concerns about safety and emergency protocols in the region, which is one of Portugal\\'s most popular destinations for UK travellers.Madeleine McCann\\'s case is still among the most terrible child disappearances in modern British history. While her parents were out dining nearby, the three-year-old disappeared from her family\\'s holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal. Madeleine has never been discovered despite years of searches spanning several nations and an international media frenzy.Greg\\'s girlfriend Nicole Ashleigh Kelso, along with Greg\\'s parents and cousin Alison Fraser, have flown to Portugal and are working with local authorities and volunteers to trace his movements. \\'We\\'re doing everything we can,\\' said Alison. \\'It\\'s like he just vanished into thin air.\\'Portuguese police have reportedly searched hospitals but have not yet confirmed any exhaustive checks of medical centres or woodland in the area. A photo released by the family shows Greg smiling in a dark Nike sports top and dark trousers, believed to have been taken just before heading out on what became his final known night.Described by his sister as a \\'quiet guy\\' and \\'really hard worker,\\' Greg is not known for erratic behaviour. The family has highlighted a distinctive unfinished Thor-style Viking tattoo on his upper right arm as a possible identifying feature if he is seen in public.A GoFundMe page set up by the family has raised over £18,665 as of Tuesday to support the search effort. Organiser Gillian McCallum said the funds will help cover on-the-ground search costs, extend the family\\'s stay in Portugal, and offer any assistance necessary to locate Greg.While the Algarve remains a much-loved destination for British tourists, this troubling case serves as a sobering reminder that even in familiar holiday hotspots, things can go drastically wrong.

Early Wednesday morning, Trump pointed to fresh data from the private payroll processor ADP showing the weakest monthly jobs total since March 2023 as further evidence that the Federal Reserve should lower interest rates to make borrowing easier for consumers and businesses. “ADP NUMBER OUT!!! \\'Too Late\\' Powell must now LOWER THE RATE. He is unbelievable!!! Europe has lowered NINE TIMES!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, referring to the Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. (The European Central Bank has in fact cut interest rates seven times since last June.) The remarks extend the president’s long-running and unprecedented pressure campaign on the Fed chief, whom he invited to the White House last week and then renewed his demand that interest rates be lowered in person. The meeting prompted a terse statement from the central bank emphasizing its independence from political influence. Trump’s post early Wednesday came after a separate one overnight complaining about his efforts to reach a new trade agreement with China and its president, Xi Jinping.“I like President XI of China, always have, and always will, but he is VERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH!!!” Trump wrote at 2:17 a.m.After campaigning on immediate economic relief for U.S. households, Trump has spent his first several months back in the White House attempting to rewrite the rules of global trade in America’s favor. In the process, he and his top officials have sought to check voters’ expectations as the United States presses for trade deals with dozens of countries that have proved less eager to swiftly strike new pacts than the administration had hoped. Meanwhile, court rulings have gummed up some of the president’s unprecedented tariff agenda, which economists increasingly say could trigger “stagflation” — higher inflation alongside lower growth and higher unemployment.Trump is also fielding with criticism of his massive spending bill from Elon Musk — previously his highest-profile and best-resourced ally — after the multibillionaire tech executive called the package a “disgusting abomination” Tuesday. NBC News reported Wednesday that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Trump is “not happy” about Musk’s “180” on his agenda. The president has not directly commented on Musk’s remarks.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office now projects the bill will add $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years.Trump has brushed aside such concerns, using the presidential bully pulpit to assign blame to those he perceives as obstacles to his economic agenda — messages that senior administration officials are amplifying.“The president did say that he believes the Fed chair is making a mistake by not lowering interest rates, which is putting us at an economic disadvantage to China and other countries,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said last week about his meeting with Powell. “The president’s been very vocal about that, both publicly and now I can reveal privately as well.”Forthcoming economic data threatens to fan the president’s frustrations anew. Analysts expect fresh federal data later this week to show 125,000 U.S. job gains last month, fewer than the 177,000 added in April. That report is due for release Friday morning, a day after the European Central Bank is widely expected to lower rates again when it updates its monetary policy Thursday.But Europe’s economic outlook is far more uncertain than that of the United States. Inflation in the Euro area now hovers below the ECB’s target of 2% as the bloc has grown just 0.3% in the first quarter. Germany, typically the economic engine of the region, has contracted two years in a row, and trade tension could make matters worse. In general, E.U. growth has been hit by weaker energy prices, slower wage growth and a strengthening currency that have all put pressure on business activity.By contrast, Goldman Sachs expects U.S. gross domestic product to expand by more than 3% in the second quarter.If Trump has been frustrated so far, he may still hold some cards to implement more of his agenda — though it could involve relenting on some key issues. Earlier this week, Fed governor Christopher Waller — a Trump appointee — gave an updated view of the economic landscape.“As of today, I see downside risks to economic activity and employment and upside risks to inflation in the second half of 2025,” Waller said Monday at a conference in South Korea, “but how these risks evolve is strongly tied to how trade policy evolves.”Rob WileRob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com.Steve KopackSteve Kopack is a producer at NBC News covering business and the economy.\\n```\\n\\n## [Before and after satellite images show the damage swarms of exploding Ukrainian drones inflicted on Russia\\'s bombers](https://www.yahoo.com/news/satellite-images-show-damage-swarms-153219464.html) (#98602)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 15:32:19+00:00\\n\\n```\\nUkraine carried out a massive drone attack on Russian airbases on Sunday.Kyiv said dozens of Russian aircraft, including its strategic bombers, were struck.New satellite imagery appears to show extensive damage at two of the airbases that were attacked.Newly captured satellite imagery captures the aftermath of the wide-scale Ukrainian drone attack that targeted multiple Russian airbases on Sunday.The photos, taken on Wednesday by US commercial satellite imaging company Maxar Technologies and obtained by Business Insider, appear to show damaged and destroyed bomber aircraft at the Belaya airbase in Russia\\'s central Irkutsk region, more than 2,500 miles from the Ukrainian border.An image taken on May 22, 2025, shows four Tu-95 aircraft at the Belaya airbase.Satellite image ©2025 Maxar TechnologiesThis June 4, 2025, image appears to show three destroyed Tu-95s.Satellite image ©2025 Maxar TechnologiesUkraine\\'s internal security agency, known as the SBU, said it used small quadcopter-style drones to strike 41 Russian aircraft. The targeted aircraft included Russian A-50 airborne early warning and control planes, An-12 transport aircraft, Il-78 refueling tankers, and Tu-95, Tu-22M3, and Tu-160 bombers, the agency said.The SBU said the attack impacted a third of Moscow\\'s strategic cruise missile carriers and caused over $7 billion in losses.Three Tu-22M aircraft are seen at Belaya on May 22, 2025.Satellite image ©2025 Maxar Technologies.Two apparently destroyed Tu-22 aircraft seen on June 4, 2025.Satellite image ©2025 Maxar Technologies.Beyond Belaya, the operation known as Spiderweb, which was over 18 months in the making, struck three other airbases across Russia: Olenya in the Murmansk region, Dyagilevo in the Ryazan region, and Ivanovo in the Ivanovo region.Maxar\\'s images also show what appear to be destroyed aircraft at the northern Olenya base.Three apparently destroyed aircraft are seen at the Olenya airbase on June 4, 2025.Satellite image ©2025 Maxar Technologies.Imagery of the airbases captured in the days and weeks leading up to the attack shows that Russia had covered many of its bombers with tires and unidentifiable objects. Moscow also painted fake aircraft on the tarmac and used debris to create decoy planes.The extensive use of deception has long been seen as an attempt by the Russians to try to confuse Ukrainian weapons systems, like drones and missiles, that are hunting its aircraft. Moscow has used this tactic at its airbases throughout the war.A \\'unique operation\\'The Ukrainian attack on the Russian bases was as audacious as it was complex and far different from any other deep strike Kyiv has carried out during the war.Planning for the operation started more than a year and a half ago, the SBU shared. The agency transported small, explosive-laden quadcopter drones to Russia, and those were followed by wooden containers that resemble shipping crates. On Russian soil, operatives hid the drones in the containers, which were placed on trucks and driven to positions near the different airbases.Then, on Sunday, the tops of the containers were remotely opened, and the drones simultaneously flew out to attack their targets in swarms, striking dozens of aircraft. Lt. Gen. Vasyl Malyuk, the SBU chief, called it a \"devastating blow\" to Russian aviation.What appears to be a destroyed Tu-22M aircraft at Belaya on June 4, 2025.Satellite image ©2025 Maxar TechnologiesVideo footage obtained by BI showed several Russian aircraft burning after they had been hit by drones. The bombers, which can travel long distances and carry heavy payloads, have been used in devastating strikes against Ukraine, Kyiv said.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said 117 first-person view (FPV) drones and as many operators were involved in the operation, which was coordinated in a field office directly next to an FSB headquarters in one of the Russian regions.\"Planning, organization, every detail was perfectly executed. I can say with certainty that this is an absolutely unique operation,\" Zelenskyy said. He added that the operatives left Russian territory before the attack and are safe.Debris seen at the Olenya airbase on June 4, 2025.Satellite image ©2025 Maxar TechnologiesThe attack further highlights how cheap drones have become an invaluable, asymmetric weapon of war with growing reach. Belaya is farther than any of Ukraine\\'s previous long-range strikes inside Russia.BI could not independently verify all the reported details of the operation, including how many aircraft were damaged or destroyed. Russia\\'s defense ministry has acknowledged the attack but downplayed its severity.It\\'s unclear how the attack will impact the Russian bomber fleet in the short and long term. Experts have said that even taking out a handful of the aircraft could have significant implications on Moscow\\'s strike campaigns, which have intensified in recent weeks.Zelenskyy said that \"before this operation was carried out, we had intelligence indicating that Russia was preparing another massive strike.\"Read the original article on Business Insider\\n```\\n\\n## [Ukrainian drone attack puts Russians and the world on notice](https://news.sky.com/story/ukrainian-drone-attack-puts-russians-and-the-world-on-notice-13379107) (#98758)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 13:58:00+00:00\\n\\n```\\nOn the eve of the peace talks in Istanbul, Ukraine launched an audacious drone attack deep within Russia: Operation Spider\\'s Web.👉Listen to The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim on your podcast app👈\\nHundreds of Ukrainian-made drones were smuggled over the border, put into crates, and launched simultaneously to blow up billions of dollars\\' worth of Russian military equipment.Ukraine penetrated as far into Russia as the North Pole is from London, or Los Angeles from New York.

Trump said: “I stated to President Putin that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon and, on this, I believe that we were in agreement.”Here’s the full post:\\nI just finished speaking, by telephone, with President Vladimir Putin, of Russia. The call lasted approximately one hour and 15 minutes. We discussed the attack on Russia’s docked airplanes, by Ukraine, and also various other attacks that have been taking place by both sides. It was a good conversation, but not a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace. President Putin did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields. We also discussed Iran, and the fact that time is running out on Iran’s decision pertaining to nuclear weapons, which must be made quickly!

Scenes of carnage were visible from the first-person view footage, with Russian planes engulfed in balls of fire.Ukraine releases dramatic FPV footage of drone attack on Russian airbases – videoThe drone attacks carried out by Ukraine in Operation Spiderweb destroyed billions of dollars worth of Russian aircraft stationed at bases across the country, including at locations as far away as Siberia, in what Kyiv claims is its longest-range assault of the war.The spectacular operation was prepared in secret over 18 months. Ukraine’s agents moved short-range drones and explosives inside Russia before they were launched remotely for a coordinated strike on Sunday that was intended to strike at Moscow’s air superiority.Drones were smuggled into Russia and placed inside containers, which were later loaded on to trucks. With the trucks positioned near Russian bases, the roof panels of the containers were lifted off by a remotely activated mechanism, allowing the drones to fly out and begin their attack. The drones had first-person view, or FPV, technology that allowed them to be operated remotely, probably from Ukrainian territory.Attempting to launch drones from Ukraine would have been much harder, as they would have had to cover huge distances and avoid Russia’s air defences.The White House confirmed yesterday that Donald Trump had no advance knowledge of the attack. He also hadn’t commented on it publicly until this afternoon’s call with Vladimir Putin.Here’s a visual guide to the operation from my colleagues:Trump says Putin told him Russia ‘will have to respond’ to Ukraine drone attacksDonald Trump has said that he has just discussed the recent drone attacks by Ukraine on Russia and developments concerning Iran in a phone call with Russian president Vladimir Putin that lasted over an hour.During the conversation, Putin told Trump that Russia will have to respond to the Ukrainian drone attacks, the US president said. “It was a good conversation, but not a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace,” he said in a Truth Social Post.Putin had said “very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields” - referring to ‘Operation Spiderweb’, which saw Ukrainian agents move drones and explosives deep inside Russia to strike four airbases - Trump said.He also said that Putin had suggested he may participate in talks with Iran to try to get a nuclear deal done. Trump said: “I stated to President Putin that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon and, on this, I believe that we were in agreement.”Here’s the full post:\\nI just finished speaking, by telephone, with President Vladimir Putin, of Russia. The call lasted approximately one hour and 15 minutes. We discussed the attack on Russia’s docked airplanes, by Ukraine, and also various other attacks that have been taking place by both sides. It was a good conversation, but not a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace. President Putin did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields. We also discussed Iran, and the fact that time is running out on Iran’s decision pertaining to nuclear weapons, which must be made quickly! I stated to President Putin that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon and, on this, I believe that we were in agreement. President Putin suggested that he will participate in the discussions with Iran and that he could, perhaps, be helpful in getting this brought to a rapid conclusion. It is my opinion that Iran has been slowwalking their decision on this very important matter, and we will need a definitive answer in a very short period of time!\\nAnalysis: Germany on tenterhooks for Merz’s first official meeting with TrumpKate ConnollyGermany’s new conservative leader, Friedrich Merz, is due in Washington tomorrow for his first official meeting with Donald Trump, putting political Berlin on tenterhooks like no other transatlantic encounter in living memory.Discussions between the German chancellor and the US president will focus on Ukraine, the Middle East and trade policies. How well or badly the talks go – during a small group meeting, followed by a lunch and then, perhaps most nail-bitingly, a press conference in the Oval Office – may shape relations for decades to come, analysts say.German chancellor Friedrich Merz will meet Donald Trump at the White House tomorrow. Photograph: Ludovic Marin/AFP/Getty ImagesHaving reportedly spoken by phone four times since Merz’s election win in February, swapped numbers and exchanged an undisclosed number of text messages, the two leaders are now on first-name terms.But Merz knows the road to a normal friendship is thorny. The transatlantic relationship has been altered almost beyond recognition since Trump’s return to office, and the shock “sits very deep”, said Mariam Lau, a journalist and the author of a new in-depth portrayal of Merz. She went on:\\nIt’s the equivalent of a medical emergency in political terms: the speed and degree to which the Merz government has had to react to the disintegration of the transatlantic alliance, one of its main foreign policy pillars, is like being forced to undergo dialysis or an organ transplantation.\\nBerlin has viewed as menacing and dangerous the unprecedented interference in German politics by leading members of the Trump administration – by his former adviser Elon Musk; the secretary of state, Marco Rubio; and the vice-president, JD Vance, in particular. There is the lack of unity over how and even whether to punish Vladimir Putin over his invasion of Ukraine, there are tensions over defence spending levels, and there are diverging viewpoints over the Middle East, and over Trump’s looming tariffs.Indeed nobody in Berlin is resting on their laurels. As to just how quickly leaders’ inaugural visits to the Oval Office can curdle, one only needs to recall Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s lions’ den encounter three months ago, or more recently the South African president Cyril Ramaphosa’s. It has not gone unnoticed that Merz called the latter last Friday, reportedly to pick up a few Trump-whisperer tips.Lau said Merz would have to “walk a tightrope between keeping an open dialogue with Trump and standing up to him, not giving into his whims”. And Merz is said to have been coached on an array of eventualities and is armed, rhetorically at least. Merz knows that keeping things brief, not interrupting, heaping praise and stressing the commonalities is the accepted playbook when dealing with Trump.NOAA \\'fully staffed\\' with forecasters and scientists, US commerce secretary saysCommerce secretary Howard Lutnick has told a Senate hearing that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is “fully staffed” with weather forecasters and scientists after concerns were raised about some offices losing 24-hour staffing ahead of hurricane season.“We are fully staffed with forecasters and scientists. Under no circumstances am I going to let public safety or public forecasting be touched,” Lutnick told a Senate appropriations subcommittee overseeing NOAA, saying he got the National Weather Service (NWS) exempted from a federal hiring freeze.NOAA, which includes the NWS, lost around 1,000 people or 10% of its workforce amid federal job layoffs in the first months of the second Trump administration, including 600 at the weather service. At least six NWS offices had stopped the routine twice-a-day weather balloon launches that collect data for weather models.The US hurricane season officially began on Sunday and lasts through November. NOAA forecast last week that this year’s season is expected to bring as many as 10 hurricanes.The agency had been scrambling to reassign staffers internally to fill gaps in understaffed offices over the last few months, sources told Reuters.Lutnick told the committee that they are going to fill these positions and focus on cutting programs that he said were not part of NOAA’s mission, including “children’s books about climate anxiety”.An internal memo seen by Reuters said that NOAA plans to hire 126 mission-critical positions at the National Weather Service including forecasters, radar technicians, hydrologists and physical scientists that will be advertised externally.Congress budget office sees economic output falling from Trump tariffsUS economic output will fall as a result of Donald Trump’s new tariffs on foreign goods that were in place as of 13 May, while also reducing federal budget deficits by $2.8tn over a decade, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has said.Reuters reports that in a letter to Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and two other high-ranking Democrats, the CBO said the tariffs, which have been challenged in court cases, will raise the costs of consumer and capital goods.“CBO estimates that, on net, real (inflation-adjusted) economic output in the United States will fall as a result,” the agency said.“Inflation will increase by an annual average of 0.4 percentage points in 2025 and 2026, in CBO’s estimation, reducing the purchasing power of households and businesses,” the letter to Schumer and senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley stated.Wyden is the senior Democrat on the Senate finance committee and Merkley is the ranking Democrat on the Senate budget committee. The three senators requested the CBO analysis on the impact of the Trump administration’s tariffs implemented between 6 January and 13 May through executive actions.The CBO’s inflation estimates were compared to an economic outlook published by the CBO on 17 January.The analysis was completed before two courts ruled that the tariffs exceeded the president’s authority to impose them. The administration has asked an appeals court to pause one of the rulings.Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker, said he tried to call Elon Musk on Tuesday night after the tech billionaire’s online outburst denouncing Donald Trump’s tax and spending bill as a “disgusting abomination”.Johnson told reporters on Wednesday:\\nI called Elon last night and he didn’t answer. I hope to talk to him today.\\nHe said he and Musk are “very friendly”, adding:\\nWe’ve laughed about our differences on policy before. I’m not upset about this.\\nMike Johnson telling reporters he had tried calling Elon Musk but he didn’t answer. Photograph: J Scott Applewhite/APTrump pushes Congress to cut $9.4bn in funding for NPR, PBS and foreign aidAdam GabbattThe Trump administration formally asked Congress to rescind $9.4bn in already approved funding from foreign aid and public broadcasters including NPR and PBS on Tuesday, seeking to enshrine spending cuts identified by Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge).The process, known as rescission, is required by Donald Trump to retrieve money from programs and policies that have already received the funding.A spokesperson for the White House office of management and budget told the Associated Press that $8.3bn was being cut from the state department and the US Agency for International Development (USAID). NPR and PBS will also lose about $1.1bn in federal funding if Congress fulfills Trump’s request.The targeting of public broadcasters fits with the Trump administration’s ongoing war on the US media. Trump signed an executive order in May cutting federal funding to NPR and PBS, and has launched multiple lawsuits against other news organizations.The House and the Senate will now weigh whether to rescind the funding. On Tuesday Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker, pledged to pass the cuts.Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said he met with US secretary of state Marco Rubio in Washington DC.In a series of posts on social media, Yermak said he and Rubio discussed the “situation on the front lines and the urgent need to strengthen support for Ukraine’s air defense.”The pair also “exchanged views on the meetings with the Russians in Istanbul, the further course of negotiations, the upcoming prisoner exchange, and the importance of bringing back all hostages and children abducted by Russia,” he said, adding:\\nI emphasized that Ukraine has done everything possible to achieve peace and is ready for a ceasefire — but Russia refuses. That is why additional sanctions are necessary.\\nHe and Rubio “agreed to coordinate our next steps,” Yermak said.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has also projected an increase of 10.9m people without health insurance under Donald Trump’s big tax and spending cut bill.That would include 1.4m people who are in the country without legal status in state-funding programs, Associated Press reports.As we reported earlier, the House-passed version of the bill could add $2.4tn to the federal government’s $36.2tn debt, according to the CBO’s revised estimate on Wednesday.The new CBO estimate takes into account late changes that were made to the bill as Republican leaders steered it to passage.Mexico will respond if there is no agreement with US on \\'unfair\\' metals tariffs, says presidentMexico will announce measures next week if there is no agreement reached with the United States on the steel and aluminum tariffs announced, president Claudia Sheinbaum has said.She also called the US announcement to raise the metals’ tariffs an “unfair measure” during her morning conference, and added that Mexico’s answer will not be “an eye for an eye”.Claudia Sheinbaum at a press conference in Mexico City on 3 June. Photograph: Mario Guzman/EPATrump\\'s \\'big, beautiful bill\\' will add $2.4tn to national debt, according to nonpartisan analysisThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has released a revised estimate of the cost of Donald Trump’s tax and spending cut bill passed by the House of Representatives, concluding it will add $2.4tn to the federal government’s $36.2tn debt.The new assessment comes a day after Elon Musk blasted the bill as a “disgusting abomination”, emboldening GOP deficit hawks who have been pushing back against the measure.An earlier CBO estimate predicted the bill, which passed through the House on 22 May by a single vote and with no Democratic support, would add around $3.8tn to Washington’s debt over the next decade.The measure, now under consideration in the Senate, aims to extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts while also achieving steep spending reductions to pay for them, largely – and highly controversially – on Medicaid.The new CBO estimate takes into account late changes that were made to the bill as Republican leaders steered it to passage.UAE seeks US trade deal to roll back Trump\\'s steel and aluminum tariffs - ReutersThe United States and the United Arab Emirates have agreed to start negotiations for a potential bilateral trade agreement that could ease tariffs on the Gulf state’s steel and aluminum industry, four people familiar with the matter have told Reuters.Emirati officials discussed the possibility of a trade agreement with US counterparts during Donald Trump’s two-day visit to Abu Dhabi last month, the sources said.The Office of the US Trade Representative did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. Neither did Emirati officials.Like other nations, the UAE has been hit by Trump’s 10% baseline tariff on its exports to the US. But its steel and aluminum products have also been hit by a 25% tariff that the Trump administration is now doubling to 50%.While the UAE is a major oil producer, its steel and aluminium products are significant non-oil exports. In 2024, the UAE was the second-largest steel and aluminium exporter to the US, accounting for 8% of total US consumption, data shows.In Abu Dhabi, Emirati officials highlighted to American counterparts comprehensive trade deals that it had signed with other countries over the past three years, the sources said, to illustrate that the UAE was capable of moving quickly on trade talks.The sources said that US officials had responded positively, although it was unclear when talks would start. Two of the sources said Washington was likely to negotiate a limited deal that would fall short of a comprehensive free trade pact.The UAE is Washington’s biggest trade partner in the Middle East, according to the Gulf state’s foreign ministry. Bilateral trade in 2024 was valued at $34.4bn, according to US trade data, with the US enjoying a $19.4bn surplus.The Gulf state, which is reliant on the US security umbrella, has pledged to invest $1.4tn in the US over the next decade. Its sovereign wealth funds, including Abu Dhabi’s $330bn Mubadala, are already big US investors, and Trump and his family have business interests in the UAE.Republican allies close to the White House are privately arguing that Elon Musk’s bombshell attacks on the spending megabill stem from the fact that it harms the tech billionaire’s business interests, according to Politico.“The West Wing is perplexed, unenthused, and disappointed” with Musk, who left the White House to attend to his ailing business empire, one White House official told the news outlet, which reports that a push is now underway among Republicans close to the White House to reframe Musk’s criticisms of the “big, beautiful bill” as self-serving.“When businessmen criticize legislation, journalists don’t take them at their word, they look at how the legislation would impact their business interests,” said one Republican close to the White House. “They should be doing that in this case.”Indeed Tesla benefitted from the Biden-era EV support package which included multiple federal tax credits, which the “big, beautiful bill” strips away, as was noted by House speaker Mike Johnson yesterday. He told reporters:\\nIt’s not personal. I know that the EV mandate [is] very important to [Musk] — that’s going away, because the government should not be subsidizing these things as part of the Green New Deal … And I know that has an effect on his business, and I lament that.\\nElon Musk at an Oval Office press conference with Donald Trump last week marking his formal exit from the White Hosue. Photograph: ShutterstockDeadline arrives for \\'best offers\\' from US trading partners to avoid tariffsToday is the White House’s deadline for countries to submit their “best offers” in trade negotiations with the US in order to avoid being slapped with steep tariffs in July.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed yesterday that the Trump administration had sent letters to trading partners to push for offers by today as the deadline approached, underlining Trump’s use of tariffs as a negotiating tool.“This letter was simply to remind these countries that the deadline is approaching and the president expects good deals, and we are on track for that,” she told reporters.Reuters first reported on the office of the US trade representative’s letter seeking to accelerate unwieldy talks with multiple partners ahead of the Trump administration’s self-imposed deadline in under five weeks.Those negotiations kicked off on 9 April when he paused his so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs for 90 days until 8 July amid stock, bond and currency markets turmoil over the sweeping levies.While over the last few months Trump and his administration officials have boasted about the number of countries reaching out to discuss trading arrangements and have even claimed that several agreements are close to being over the line, they have also admitted that talks have been slow-moving and they don’t have the capacity to negotiate (hugely complex) trade deals with so many countries at once.The US has so far only reached a framework agreement with the UK, and an agreement with China that both countries are now accusing each other of reneging on.Trump officials delayed - and redacted part of - farm trade report over deficit forecast - PoliticoTrump administration officials delayed and redacted a government forecast because it predicts an increase in the nation’s trade deficit in farm goods later this year, two people familiar with the matter have told Politico, in a story that could raise questions about potential political interference in government reports that present “politically inconvenient” data.Here’s an extract from Politico’s story:\\nThe numbers run counter to Donald Trump’s messaging that his economic policies, including tariffs, will reduce US trade imbalances. The politically inconvenient data prompted administration officials to block publication of the written analysis normally attached to the report because they disliked what it said about the deficit.\\nThe highly unusual rollout could raise questions about potential political meddling with government reports that have traditionally been trusted for decades.\\n“Objectivity is really key here and the public depends on it,” said Joe Glauber, a former USDA chief economist. “To lose that trust would be terrible.”\\nA USDA spokesperson blamed the delay on an internal review.\\n“The report was hung up in internal clearance process and was not finalized in time for its typical deadline,” said USDA spokesperson Alec Varsamis in a statement. “Given this report is not statutory as with many other reports USDA does, the Department is undergoing a review of all of its non-statutory reports, including this one, to determine next steps.”\\nIt’s not clear when or if the written analysis portion will be released.\\nTrump calls again on Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell to lower interest ratesDonald Trump has – once again – called on Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, to lower interest rates, noting that payroll processing firm ADP reported that job creation slowed in May.In the post on his Truth Social platform, he said that Powell – who in the past he has called a “major loser” – is “unbelievable”.\\nADP NUMBER OUT!!! “Too Late” Powell must now LOWER THE RATE. He is unbelievable!!! Europe has lowered NINE TIMES!\\nADP’s report showed private payrolls ticked up by only 37,000 in May - far below the Dow Jones forecast for 110,000 - and mark the lowest monthly reading from ADP since March 2023.At a meeting with Trump at the White House last week, Powell had pushed back against the president’s demands, telling him “that the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming economic information and what that means for the outlook,” according to an unusually blunt statement issued by the central bank.Trump, who has attacked Powell repeatedly over the Fed’s decision to not lower interest rates, recently said he has no intention of trying to fire Powell. But the possibility of a firing has unsettled financial markets that bank on an independent Fed’s ability to do its job without political interference.Earlier this month, Powell kept interest rates on hold and cautioned that the president’s tariff regime was likely to raise prices, weaken growth and increase unemployment in the US if maintained.The statement went on to say that Powell maintained that the Fed “will set monetary policy, as required by law, to support maximum employment and stable prices and will make those decisions based solely on careful, objective, and non-political analysis”.The full statement read:\\nAt the President’s invitation, Chair Powell met with the President today at the White House to discuss economic developments including for growth, employment, and inflation.\\nChair Powell did not discuss his expectations for monetary policy, except to stress that the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming economic information and what that means for the outlook.\\nFinally, Chair Powell said that he and his colleagues on the FOMC will set monetary policy, as required by law, to support maximum employment and stable prices and will make those decisions based solely on careful, objective, and non-political analysis.\\n```\\n\\n## [Expert says Trump and Musk\\'s relationship was doomed from the very start](https://metro.co.uk/2025/06/04/expert-says-trump-musks-relationship-doomed-start-23330443/) (#99422)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 16:16:12+00:00\\n\\n```\\nDonald Trump and Elon Musk during a White House meeting earlier this year (Picture: Roberto Schmidt/AFP)\\nIt’s no shock the ‘short-lived romance’ between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has come to a crashing end, according to an expert on US politics – it was all a question of ego.\\nThe US President and the world’s richest man formally brought their working relationship to a close last month in an Oval Office press conference.\\nThere did not appear to be any animosity between the pair at the time, with Trump thanking Musk for ‘tirelessly helping lead the most sweeping and consequential government reform programme in generations’.\\nBut things have gone sour rather quickly.\\nYesterday afternoon, the South African billionaire described Trump’s flagship Congressional spending bill as a ‘disgusting abomination’.\\nAngelia Wilson, Professor of Politics at the University of Manchester, said this moment was predictable from the moment Musk joined the Republican’s presidential campaign last year.\\nShe said: ‘I hope most of the world could see that those two rather significant egos were not going to stay best buddies for long.’\\nProfessor Wilson argues Musk stepped in to fill a role played by Steve Bannon, the founder of alt-right news website Breitbart, during Trump’s first campaign and administration.\\nSteve Bannon remains a strong supporter of Donald Trump (Picture: Shannon Finney/Getty Images for Semafor)\\nBannon served as the White House Chief Strategist following the inauguration but had a similarly truncated tenure, leaving just seven months in the job.\\nBoth he and Musk played the part of a ‘best friend’, Professor Wilson said, offering ‘some direction of something new and different and interesting’.\\nShe said: ‘Look at the cycle of American politics, and look at the cycle of the previous Trump administration.\\n‘We had Bannon, and they came in and did this, “we’re going to get rid of half the government”, “we’re going to shrink the size of the government”, and then realised that they’re not walking into a palace.\\n‘He’s not a king, and there is eventually going to be some pushback about that. And those type of men with large egos are going to struggle if they’re in it for their own ego and not in it for the country.’\\nElon Musk jumped in delight while campaigning for Donald Trump in Pennsylvania (Picture: Jim Watson/AFP)\\nAfter announcing his backing for Trump shortly after the then-candidate survived an assassination attempt, Musk became comfortably the biggest single political donor in last year’s election.\\nHe gave a total of $288 million (around £210m) to support the Republican presidential nominee and other party figures down the ballot.\\nWhen Trump entered the White House to begin his second term, he appointed Musk to head up the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) and handed him an enormous amount of power.\\nSo far, Doge has not saved anywhere near the amount of money Musk said it would – but it has fired tens of thousands of government workers and effectively shut down major bodies such as aid agency USAID.\\nProfessor Wilson, author of a book on Trump’s rise titled The Politics of Hate, argues that despite Musk’s description of himself as ‘first buddy’, the two men probably never really liked each other much.\\n‘I think when you’re talking about two significant figures like that, or any significant figures that have such large egos and are in politics, I wouldn’t throw around the word “like”,’ she said.\\n‘I don’t know what their basis of their friendship was, but I don’t think it was even to the extent of a Facebook friendship, that they weren’t, in that sense, emotionally close. It was, if anything, a partnership of convenience.’\\nMusk in the press conference that marked the end of his time working with the White House (Picture: Reuters)\\nBut if it was a partnership of convenience, it seems to have been an extremely lucrative one.\\nWhile Trump got ‘a bro that would help him get elected with something new and shiny’, Professor Wilson said, Musk got to cut regulations and gained access to ‘the data that he needs or that he wanted’ from government files.\\nThat may be a reason why – despite the Tesla boss’s fury over the spending bill – neither Trump nor his administration have fired back with vicious insults, as they have in the past when criticised.\\nProfessor Wilson predicted: ‘I don’t think Musk is going to be an enemy of the White House.’\\nGet in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.\\nFor more stories like this, check our news page.\\nArrow\\nMORE: Women who have a miscarriage in West Virginia could be prosecuted\\nArrow\\nMORE: Urgent health alert for ham croquettes in the US over allergy fears\\nArrow\\nMORE: Three missing sisters found dead after going to visit dad as manhunt for him is underway\\nNews Updates\\nStay on top of the headlines with daily email updates.\\n```\\n\\n## [Putin tells Trump Russia will respond to Ukrainian attack on warplanes](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/putin-tells-trump-russia-respond-ukrainian-attack-warplanes) (#99664)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 16:59:10+00:00\\n\\n```\\nNEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!\\nPresident Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he spoke over the phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said that Russia would have to respond to a recent Ukrainian attack on Russian warplanes.Trump said the phone call with Putin lasted about one hour and 15 minutes, noting that it was \"not a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace.\"\"We discussed the attack on Russia’s docked airplanes, by Ukraine, and also various other attacks that have been taking place by both sides,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. \"It was a good conversation, but not a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace.

Dyagilevo in western Russia; Ivanovo, northeast of Moscow; and Podmoskovye in Moscow.Sources inside Ukraine\\'s SBU security service claimed the operation crippled 34 per cent of Russia\\'s long-range strategic bombers, including the nuclear-capable Tu-95s and Tu-22s, often used to launch cruise missiles into Ukraine.Other aircraft which were hit included the nuclear-capable Tu-160 bomber, the An-12 transport plane and the Il-78 tanker, according to the SBU.\\xa0The footage was released as new satellite images of Belaya airbase have shown severe damage to at least three Tu-95s, according to analysts.

The pair have gone missing, say reports.Putin-backing Readovka media outlet reported:\\xa0\\'Artem is now wanted in connection with a terrorist attack in Irkutsk region.\\'Four lorries were registered in his name, and one of them was the source of the drones that launched [in an attack on a Putin airbase].\\'His wife \\'has not been online for two weeks, and she has scrubbed all her active social media accounts.\\'Relatives of the couple declined to comment, according to Readovka.

It is unclear if he had sought to alter his name. The new footage was shown as Putin held a video conference with senior officials. It was the first time he had been seen publicly since the humiliating Sunday strikes Ukraine took out an estimated £1.5billion worth of Russian military equipment, including several Tu-95s (pictured) Also destroyed were several Tu-22Ms (pictured), of which less than 500 were manufactured Ukraine managed to destroy an A-50 Mainstay (pictured), which is used as an aerial command and radar centre Satellite image of the Belaya airfield, after a Ukrainian drone attack targeting Russian military airfields Head of the Ukraine\\'s Security Service Vasyl Maliuk looks at a map of an airfield, amid Russia\\'s attack on Ukraine, in an unknown location in Ukraine He is specifically wanted over the strike against a Russian airbase in Irkutsk region.In 2014–2015, he lived in Kyiv, and mingled with local musicians, frequently attending parties.Reports say he co-owned a local clothing brand, posting photos from the Euromaidan protests, and mocking ex-president Yanukovych.Ukraine\\'s SBU secret service said its main agents in the audacious strikes on the air bases had already left Russia.Zelensky today urged Kyiv\\'s military backers to ramp up support in a bid to pressure Russia towards peace.\\'We must not allow Russia to blur reality or mislead the world. Moscow must be forced into diplomacy,\\' Zelensky said in a video address to defence ministers meeting in Brussels.And after Sunday\\'s devastating blow to Moscow, German defence minister Boris Pistorius said today that military success by Russia in its war in Ukraine was neither imminent nor to be expected.\\n```\\n\\n## [What is the CBO? A look at the small office inflaming debate over Trump\\'s tax bill](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/cbo-small-office-inflaming-debate-trumps-tax-bill-122498996) (#102447)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 17:02:40+00:00\\n\\n```\\nWASHINGTON -- A small government office with some 275 employees has found itself caught in the political crossfire as Congress debates President Donald Trump’s “one big beautiful bill.” The Congressional Budget Office has projected that the legislation would increase federal deficits by about $2.4 trillion over 10 years. That\\'s a problem for a Republican Congress that has spent much of the past four years criticizing former President Joe Biden and Democrats for the nation\\'s rising debt levels.The White House and Republican leaders in Congress are taking issue with CBO\\'s findings. They say economic growth will be higher than the office is projecting, resulting in more revenue coming into government coffers. Meanwhile, Democrats are touting CBO\\'s findings as evidence of the bill\\'s failings. Here\\'s a look at the office at the center of Washington\\'s latest political tug-of-war.Lawmakers established the Congressional Budget Office more than 50 years ago to provide objective, impartial analysis to support the budget process. The CBO is required to produce a cost estimate for nearly every bill approved by a House or Senate committee and will weigh in earlier when asked to do so by lawmakers. It also produces a report each Congress on how to reduce the debt if lawmakers so choose with each option including arguments for or against. Plus, it publishes detailed estimates when presidents make proposals that would affect mandator spending, which includes programs such as Social Security and Medicare.Lawmakers created the office to help Congress play a stronger role in budget matters, providing them with an alternative to the Office of Management and Budget, which is part of a Republican or Democratic administration, depending upon the president in office.CBO hires analysts based on their expertise, not political affiliation. Staff is expected to maintain objectivity and avoid political influence. In evaluating potential employees, the CBO says that for most positions it looks at whether that person would be perceived to be free from political bias. Like other federal employees, the CBO\\'s staff is also prohibited from making political contributions to members of Congress.The CBO\\'s director, Phillip Swagel, served in former Republican President George W. Bush’s administration as an economic adviser and as an assistant secretary at the Treasury Department.The stakes are incredibly high with Republicans looking to pass their massive tax cut and immigration bill by early July.Outside groups, Democrats and some Republicans are highlighting CBO\\'s analysis that the bill will increase federal deficits by about $2.4 trillion over 10 years and leave 10.9 million more people uninsured in 2034.Republicans spent much of Biden\\'s presidency focused on curbing federal deficits. They don\\'t want to be seen as contributing to the fiscal problem. GOP lawmakers say the CBO isn\\'t giving enough credit to the economic growth the bill will create, to the point where it would be deficit-neutral in the long run, if not better. \"The CBO assumes long-term GDP growth of an anemic 1.8% and that is absurd,\" said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. “The American economy is going to boom like never before after the ‘One Big, Beautiful Bill’ is passed.”Republicans began taking issue with the CBO even before Trump and the current Congress were sworn into office.“CBO will always predict a dark future when Republicans propose tax relief – but the reality is never so dire,\" Rep. Jason Smith, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a December news release.Recently, House Speaker Mike Johnson has been taking digs at the office. “The CBO is notorious for getting things WRONG,” he said in a Facebook post.In April 2018, CBO said that tax receipts would total $27 trillion from fiscal years 2018 to 2024.Receipts came in about $1.5 trillion higher than the CBO projected. Republicans have seized on that discrepancy.But the numbers don\\'t tell the whole story. Some of the criticism of the CBO ignores the context of a global pandemic as the federal government rushed to prop the economy up with massive spending bills under both Trump and Biden. In a blog post last December, Swagel pointed out three reasons for the higher revenues: The primary reason was the burst of inflation that began in March 2021 as the country was recovering from COVID. That burst of inflation, he said, led to about $900 billion more in revenue. There was also an increase in economic activity in “the later years of the period” adding $700 billion. Also, new tariffs added about $250 billion, with other legislation partially offsetting those three factors.\\n```\\n\\n## [Op Spiderweb: Ukraine said drones hit Russia\\'s planes using AI when they lost signal](https://www.businessinsider.com/operation-spiderweb-ukraine-drones-ai-hit-russia-planes-lost-signal-2025-6) (#102673)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 16:59:47+00:00\\n\\n```\\nUkraine says the drones that hit Russian aircraft used AI to find and strike their targets when they lost signal\\nA still from drone footage that Ukraine\\'s security service said was from its attack on Russian airfields that damaged Russian aircraft.\\nX/ServiceSsu\\n2025-06-04T16:59:47Z\\nUkraine said the drones it used in its major attack on Russia used AI when they lost signal.\\nThe drones used AI to move along a pre-planned route, and their warheads were automatically activated.\\nUkraine said that 41 Russian aircraft were hit and that many were \"irretrievably destroyed.\"\\nThe attack drones that Ukraine used to hit Russian aircraft at a string of bases turned to AI to find and strike their targets when they lost signal, Ukraine\\'s security service said.The Security Service of Ukraine, or SBU, said in a Wednesday update on its Operation Spiderweb attack that some drones, upon losing signal, \"switched to performing a mission using artificial intelligence along a pre-planned route. \"\"And after approaching and contacting a specifically designated target, the warhead was automatically activated,\" it said.\\nThe security service said it was using \"modern UAV control technology\" that combines \"artificial intelligence algorithms and manual operator intervention.\"The SBU said that it hit 41 Russian aircraft in its attack on Sunday, which involved drones snuck into positions close to Russian airbases and then launched in swarms.The service said of the Russian aircraft on Wednesday that \"a significant part of them was irretrievably destroyed.\" It said \"some damaged aircraft will take many years to rebuild.\"\\nA satellite view shows military aircraft, some sitting destroyed, at the Belaya air base, near Stepnoy, Irkutsk region, Russia, after Ukraine\\'s attack.\\n2025 Planet Labs PBC/via REUTERS\\nVideo footage and satellite imagery show that attacks took place at multiple bases and that some aircraft were damaged, but the full extent of destruction noted by Ukraine has not been independently verified.Both Russia and Ukraine are increasingly relying on drones as Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine continues. Drone proliferation has led to a race to develop electronic warfare to jam drones and prevent systems from working properly.Drone makers and operators are, in turn, working to find new ways to operate their uncrewed systems, including designing unjammable fiber-optic drones, working without using GPS, and using AI-enabled drones that can function with less human input.A Ukrainian war researcher reported earlier this year that drones equipped with AI are three to four times more likely to hit their target than ones that are only directed by humans.Artificial intelligence is a new technology that both countries are rushing to develop and are increasingly using, but neither side is fielding AI drones on the battlefield at scale yet, according to a new report from the Washington, D.C.-based Institute for the Study of War.The reported use of AI in this attack is notable, but it\\'s far from the only thing the stands out.Ukraine has been conducting long-range strikes that have hit Russian airfields hundreds of miles into Russia and destroyed aircraft. But this new attack is different in that it used drones secretly moved into the country and then launched from positions near the targeted airbases. The SBU said it brought drones into Russia and put them into containers that they loaded onto trucks and drove to spots close to the Russian bases.\\nThis image shows several damaged bombers at the Belaya airbase.\\n2025 Planet Labs PBC/via REUTERS\\nThe SBU said the container covers were opened remotely, allowing the drones to fly out. The service shared images of dozens of drones inside large containers, which it said were used in the attack.Mark Cancian, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told BI that this attack stood out from many in this war, with drones \"launched close by.\" Russia was likely designing airfield protections for a different type of attack. This attack was different from what it had previously faced.Ukraine\\'s account of the attack details an operation that many warfare experts have described as pioneering and that could have big ramifications for how countries attack and protect their aircraft and bases.James Patton Rogers, a drone expert and the executive director of the Cornell Brooks Tech Policy Institute, told BI that \"this attack is a window to future war.\"Richard Aboulafia, an aviation expert and the managing director of the US consulting firm AeroDynamic Advisory, described the operation to BI as \"mind blowing\" in how it was able to be pulled off across such a large area and with so many people involved.The SBU said the 41 aircraft that it hit included the A-50 airborne early warning and control plane, Tupolev Tu-95, Tu-22, and Tu-160 bombers, An-12 transport aircraft, and the Il-78 refueling tanker.\\nA Russian Tu-160, one of the aircraft types that Ukraine said it hit in its attack.\\nNATO/ Belgian Air Force\\nThose aircraft have been key to firing missiles at Ukraine and gathering intelligence. And many of them cannot be easily replaced as Russia stopped production years ago.Justin Bronk, an air power expert at the Royal United Services Institute, told BI that even if the number of planes damaged or destroyed is less than what Ukraine has claimed, \"it will have a significant impact\" on Russia\\'s ability to \"keep up its regular large scale cruise missile salvos against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure\" while also keeping up its nuclear deterrence and signaling patrols.The SBU framed the attack as a direct response to Russia\\'s missile attacks. Lt. Gen. Vasyl Maliuk, head of the SBU, said Sunday that \"the adversary bombed our country almost every night from these aircraft, and today they have felt that retribution is inevitable.\"He added that \"the enemy thought it could bomb Ukraine and kill Ukrainians endlessly and with impunity. This is not the case. We will respond to russian terror and destroy the enemy everywhere — at sea, in the air and on land.\"The SBU said the attack hit four airfields — Olenya\", \"Ivanovo\", \"Dyagilevo,\" and \"Belaya\" — across three time zones, and it took more than a year and a half of planning. The service said the estimated cost of the equipment that was affected by the operation was over $7 billion.\\nUkraine\\nRussia\\nDrones\\nMore\\nRead next\\n```\\n\\n## [Satellite images show the unusual tire tactic and fake decoy aircraft that failed to save Russia\\'s bombers from Ukrainian drones](https://www.businessinsider.com/images-russian-tire-tactic-fake-planes-ukrainian-drone-attack-2025-6) (#102674)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 16:55:06+00:00\\n\\n```\\nTu-22M bombers covered with objects are seen at Belaya airbase on May 20, 2025.\\nSatellite image ©2025 Maxar Technologies\\n2025-06-04T16:55:06Z\\nSatellite images show Russia tried using deceptive tactics at the airbases Ukraine attacked Sunday.\\nThese tactics included placing tires on wings and painting fake decoy planes on the ground.\\nIt\\'s a playbook that Moscow has used throughout the war to try to protect its airbases.\\nSatellite imagery of the four Russian airbases that were attacked by Ukraine on Sunday shows how Moscow attempted to use deceptive tactics to protect its strategic bomber fleet.The images, captured by US commercial satellite imaging company Maxar Technologies and obtained by Business Insider, show that Russia had many of its bombers covered with tires and other objects in the days and weeks before the Ukrainian operation.Moscow\\'s forces also painted fake aircraft on the tarmac and used debris to create decoy planes.\\nUkraine carries out massive drone attack on Russian bombers\\nUkraine\\'s SBU, its internal security agency, said it used small quadcopter drones to hit 41 Russian aircraft in the daring operation, more than 18 months in the making.

Why?\\nBy Peter Kafka\\nChief Correspondent covering media and technology\\nDonald Trump gave Elon Musk a \"key to the White House\" after Musk criticized Trump\\'s budget bill. Now Musk has criticized the same bill with even stronger language — and Trump has yet to respond.\\nALLISON ROBBERT/AFP via Getty Images\\n2025-06-04T20:08:06Z\\nIf you come at Donald Trump, he\\'s going to respond.\\nUnless, apparently, you\\'re Elon Musk. Trump hasn\\'t said a word about Musk\\'s public complaints about Trump\\'s budget bill.\\nIt\\'s hard to imagine Trump staying silent forever. But even this restraint tells you a lot about the Musk/Trump alliance.\\nA pretty fundamental rule of political physics in our age: If you criticize Donald Trump, he roars back.Which makes what\\'s happening now worth noting: Elon Musk is criticizing Donald Trump, and Trump … isn\\'t responding.As you likely know by now, on Tuesday afternoon, Musk used his X account to complain about the Republican budget bill — the one that\\'s supposed to be Trump\\'s signature legislation, and the one that\\'s literally called the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" act because that\\'s the name Trump likes.\\nMore specifically: Musk called the bill \"a disgusting abomination.\"\"Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it,\" he added.That story — the richest man in the world, and for at least several months, a key Trump ally, blasting a Trump project in public — dominated Tuesday\\'s news cycle. Even Fox News had to cover it.\\nAnd under normal circumstances, Trump would rage back. Not this time, though.Trump has yet to acknowledge Musk\\'s broadside out loud. On Wednesday afternoon, as Musk was continuing to attack the bill on Twitter/X, Trump used his Truth Social platform to repost a tweet from Musk thanking Trump for letting him oversee the DOGE project.But he has yet to weigh in directly on Musk\\'s criticism.When a Fox News reporter asked White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt \"how mad\" Trump would be when he learned about Musk\\'s comments, she had a restrained answer ready: \"The president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill. It doesn\\'t change the president\\'s opinion. This is one big, beautiful bill, and he\\'s sticking to it.\"And when I asked the White House press office for comment Wednesday morning, they referred me to Leavitt\\'s previous statement.Obvious conclusion: For now, at least, the Trump team is going out of its way not to stoke a feud with Musk.It seems very unlikely that Trump\\'s silence is going to be permanent: Trump loves holding forth in front of the press, so someone\\'s going to ask him about it at some point.Still, this level of what seems to be restraint is remarkable for a man who doesn\\'t usually restrain himself, and who loathes people who poke at him in public. What\\'s happening?For starters, it\\'s worth noting that Trump has already gone through a version of this. Last week, Musk used much more muted language to criticize the same bill in a CBS interview, and those comments also became a news story. And Trump didn\\'t fire back at Musk then, either — even when asked about it at a press conference.It\\'s also worth noting that even though Musk used scathing language to condemn the bill on Tuesday, he never once criticized Trump directly.That gives both men rhetorical wiggle room: Musk can argue that his problems with the bill have nothing to do with the man who\\'s promoting it. And Trump can lump in Musk\\'s critique along with everyone else who has problems with the bill, including some Republicans like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.But it\\'s also likely that the most likely thing is the most likely thing: That Donald Trump has enormous admiration for Elon Musk, and treats him differently than just about anyone else in the world. And that even though Musk has officially left his role as a part-time White House advisor, Trump still wants him on his side.For now.\\nTech\\nElon Musk\\nDonald Trump\\nMore\\nCongress\\nRead next\\n```\\n\\n## [The Russian aircraft Ukraine said it hit were missile carriers and other key planes that aren\\'t easily replaced](https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-russian-aircraft-hit-fire-missiles-monitor-skies-2025-6) (#102687)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 14:49:43+00:00\\n\\n```\\nA Russian Tu-22M, one of the aircraft type that Ukraine said it hit in its Sunday attack.\\nAP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko\\n2025-06-04T14:49:43Z\\nUkraine said it hit 41 Russian aircraft in a daring attack on multiple airfields.\\nThe aircraft Ukraine said that it hit fire missiles at Ukraine and execute other critical missions.\\nMany of them cannot be easily replaced as Russia has stopped making them.\\nUkraine launched a daring attack on multiple Russian airfields on Sunday, claiming hits on 41 Russian aircraft, including certain strategic planes that aren\\'t easily replaced.The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said that its operatives positioned drones close to airfields in trucks before releasing them to target Russian aircraft in \"Operation Spiderweb.\" Videos, including drone footage obtained by Business Insider, showed burning Russian bombers.The SBU said aircraft hit included the A-50 airborne early warning and control plane, Tupolev Tu-95, Tu-22, and Tu-160 bombers, An-12 transport aircraft, and the Il-78 refueling tanker.\\nUkraine carries out massive drone attack on Russian bombers\\nMany of the Russian aircraft Ukraine said it hit have been seen damaged, destroyed, or burning in videos of the attack from the SBU and satellite images of the Russian bases. The SBU said that some of the planes were \"irretrievably destroyed\" while others will \"take many years to rebuild.\"Key Russian aircraftAny A-50 loss means a loss of situational awareness for Russia\\'s air force. These important air assets amplify the effectiveness of Russia\\'s air force by detecting enemy aircraft, missiles, air defense systems, and ground targets. They also act as mobile command-and-control centers for directing attacks.Ukraine has shot down multiple A-50s during Russia\\'s invasion, meaning Russia likely only has a handful left. These aircraft are estimated to cost around $300 million each.\\nA Russian Beriev A-50.\\nAP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko, Pool, File\\nAmong the other planes that Ukraine said it hit are ones Russia has used to fire missiles in its invasion.The Tu-22M is a Soviet-era bomber that its manufacturer, Tupolev, describes as a \"long-range supersonic missile carrier bomber\" designed to strike ground and sea targets using guided missiles and aerial bombs.The head of Ukraine\\'s military intelligence service told BBC Ukraine last year that it carries the Kh-22 missiles, which have caused tremendous damage to Ukrainian cities like Odesa.Ukraine has previously claimed to have destroyed some Tu-22Ms, both in the air and at an airfield deep inside Russia. Ukraine estimates the planes cost around $100 million each.The Tu-95 is a Cold War-era long-range turboprop bomber that can carry eight long-range cruise missiles armed with either conventional or nuclear warheads. Russia has also used it for attacks on Ukraine.Russia also uses the Tu-160 — a heavy supersonic long-range strategic bomber first introduced during the Soviet era that is able to carry nuclear and conventional cruise missiles — in its attacks.Justin Bronk, an airpower expert at the Royal United Services Institute, told Business Insider that both the Tu-95 and the Tu-160 had been \"heavily tasked\" with firing Kh-101 missiles at Ukraine.The SBU said the damage inflicted by its attack could be $7 billion, a figure that has not been independently verified. The head of the agency, Lt. Gen. Vasyl Maliuk, said that the attack was meant to curb Russian attacks on Ukraine.\"The adversary bombed our country almost every night from these aircraft, and today they have felt that retribution is inevitable,\" Maliuk said. The general said the security agency \"is doing and will do everything possible to protect Ukraine.\"Hard to replaceDollar figures are tossed around for the planes Ukraine hit, but Russia can\\'t replace some of these aircraft easily.\\nProduction of the Tu-95 and Tu-22M stopped after the USSR collapsed in 1991. Russia also no longer makes A-50s, though it said last year that production may restart. Tu-160s are still made, but slowly. Reports indicate only two have been made since 2022.Bronk said replacing the losses will be \"very challenging\" for Russia.\"The Tu-95 has not been produced for more than 30 years and production/modernisation of the Tu-160 is at a very limited scale,\" he said in emailed comments to BI.\\nA Russian Tupolev Tu-95 strategic bomber.\\nALEXANDER NEMENOV/AFP via Getty Images\\nMaliuk said that \"34% of strategic cruise missile carriers at the main Russian airfields were hit.\" Imagery from the sites confirms some of the reported destruction.Satellite images from company Capella Space and seen by Reuters show what experts told the outlet appeared to be several destroyed and damaged Tu-95s and Tu-22s.A win for UkraineBronk said that the destruction that can be seen visually shows \"this is a stunning success for Ukraine\\'s special services.\" He pointed to confirmation of the destruction of around eight Tu-95 bombers, a Tu-22M3, and several other aircraft.The 41 aircraft figure given by Ukraine is being debated. Some analyses based on visual evidence that is available so far have pointed to a lower figure.Bronk said that if even half of Ukraine\\'s claim of 41 aircraft were damaged or destroyed, \"it will have a significant impact\" on Russia\\'s ability to \"keep up its regular large scale cruise missile salvos against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure\" while also keeping up its nuclear deterrence and signaling patrols against NATO and Japan.How the attack affects the battlefield, where Ukraine is facing a relentless push from Russia\\'s larger military and dampening US support, remains to be seen.Dan Grazier, a security expert at the Stimson Center, told BI that he was skeptical that it was \"really going to move the needle in one way or the other\" on the battlefield.That said, the attack is still significant and rewrites the rules of warfare, experts say.The SBU said the attack hit four Russian airfields simultaneously across three time zones, explaining that the plan allowed it to hit the largest number of Russian aircraft at the same time.\\nA satellite view shows military aircraft, some sitting destroyed, at the Belaya air base, near Stepnoy, Irkutsk region, Russia after Ukraine\\'s attack.\\n2025 Planet Labs PBC/via REUTERS\\nIt said it brought drones in mobile containers into Russia, hiding the drones on trucks. The container roofs were opened remotely \"at the right moment\" and the drones struck their targets. The details of the operation have not been independently verified.It said the operation was planned for more than a year and a half.Tim Robinson, a military aviation specialist at the UK\\'s Royal Aeronautical Society, told BI the attack will spook Western air forces. \"If you\\'re an Air Force chief and you are not lying awake at night thinking about how to protect you, you\\'re going to lose the next war.\"And it\\'s a statement of intent from Ukraine.Maliuk said \"the enemy thought it could bomb Ukraine and kill Ukrainians endlessly and with impunity. This is not the case. We will respond to russian terror and destroy the enemy everywhere — at sea, in the air and on land.\"\\n```\\n\\n## [Trump says he spoke with Putin about Ukraine\\'s weekend attack and that Russia plans to respond](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/trump-says-he-spoke-with-putin-about-ukraine-major-weekend-attack/) (#103034)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 17:19:00+00:00\\n\\n```\\nPresident Trump said Wednesday that he\\'d had a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin where the two discussed Ukraine\\'s attack on Sunday that hit targets deep in Russian territory.

Putin on the phone for more than an hour on Wednesday.“President Putin did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields,” Mr. Trump said in a statement on social media. He described their exchange as a “good conversation, but not a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace.” The post later disappeared from the site without explanation.Mr. Trump did not say in the statement if he sought to discourage Mr. Putin from attacking Ukraine. The White House did not respond to a question inquiring if Mr. Trump pushed back against Mr. Putin. He rather expressed optimism over the prospect of working with Mr. Putin on another foreign policy priority: deterring Iran’s nuclear capabilities.The post broke a rare, if temporary, silence by Mr. Trump on complex international affairs. The statement was his first about Kyiv’s drone attack on airfields in Russia, a stunning assault that hit nuclear-capable bombers, revealing a significant vulnerability.In what amounted to a strategic and symbolic blow, Ukraine hid drones across Russia before attacking airfields in five regions stretching across five time zones. The attack cost about $7 billion in damage.Mr. Trump described the episode as if he were a bystander, and suggested that an aggressive Russian response was a fait accompli.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

And that’s what they did.”Kellogg also repeated rumours that Ukraine had struck the Russian nuclear fleet at Severomorsk, although reports of an explosion there have not been confirmed. He said the US was “trying to avoid” an escalation.Other current and former members of the administration skeptical of US support for Ukraine have also vocally opposed the drone strikes.“It is not in America’s interest for Ukraine to be attacking Russia’s strategic nuclear forces the day before another round of peace talks,” said Dan Caldwell, an influential foreign policy adviser who was a senior aide to Pete Hegseth at the Pentagon until he was purged amid a leaking scandal last month.“This has the potential to be highly escalatory and raises the risk of direct confrontation between Russia and Nato,” he said. “US should not only distance itself from this attack but end any support that could directly or indirectly enable attacks against Russian strategic nuclear forces.”It is not the first time that concerns over Russia’s use of a nuclear weapon have been used to try to temper US support for Ukraine.As Moscow’s forces were routed near Kharkiv and in the south at Kherson in September 2022, Russian officials sent signals that the Kremlin was considering using a battlefield nuclear weapon, senior Biden officials have said.National security officials said they believed that if the Russian lines collapsed and left open the potential for a Ukrainian attack on Crimea, then there was a 50% chance that Russia would use a nuclear weapon as a result.Ukrainian officials have responded by saying that Russia has embellished its threats of a nuclear attack in order to blackmail the US from giving greater support to Ukraine.\\n```\\n\\n## [Putin Intends to Respond to Ukraine Strikes on Russian Bombers, Trump Says](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/world/europe/putin-zelensky-accusations-escalation.html) (#103932)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 21:31:04+00:00\\n\\n```\\nAfter Russia launched more than 1,000 drones per week at military and civilian targets in Ukraine in recent months, including more than 300 in a single night last week, Ukraine mounted an audacious drone attack on Russian strategic bomber bases on Sunday.Now President Vladimir V.

The image is the logo of one of Trump’s digital currencies, and the website claims to be the “Official $Trump Wallet”, hawking a product that would allow customers to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, primarily the president’s own.The website prominently features the name of Trump’s coin, $Trump, and invites people to join the waitlist to use the digital wallet. It was first noticed by the crypto newsletter Citation Needed. Magic Eden, an established cryptocurrency marketplace, said on the website that it had partnered with Trump’s official digital coin team to create the wallet. The Twitter/X account for one of Trump’s cryptocurrencies promoted the wallet product as well.“The $TRUMP Wallet powered by @magiceden is coming soon. Join the $TRUMP community! http://TrumpWallet.com,” reads a tweet from @TrumpMeme.Though the announcements bear the markers of legitimacy and official involvement, Trump’s sons have called foul.“The Trump Organization has zero involvement with this wallet product,” Donald Trump Jr. quickly posted to the social media site X on Tuesday. Shortly after, Eric Trump posted: “I run @Trump and I know nothing about this project!” Even Barron Trump chimed in saying: “To be clear, our family has zero involvement with this wallet.”Trump Jr added that he’d been “working tirelessly” on launching an official wallet with another of the family’s crypto businesses, World Liberty Financial, which Trump and his sons created last year.The cryptocurrency industry is known for frauds, scams and infighting. The latest spat between Magic Eden and World Liberty Financial appears to stem from a conflict between Trump’s sons and Bill Zanker, who is a longtime business partner of Trump. Zanker runs the business that issued $Trump, Fight Fight Fight LLC, which is separate from the Trump Organization and World Liberty. The Trump Organization also owns a firm called CIC Digital, which, along with Fight Fight Fight, oversees and profits from the trade of the cryptocurrency while owning 80% of the coin’s reserves, on paper worth about $2bn.On X, Magic Eden and Zanker’s company both said the crypto wallet announced on Tuesday was indeed affiliated with Trump and powered by Magic Eden.Eric Trump maintained this was wrong. Later on Tuesday, he issued a warning on X: “This project is not authorized by @Trump,” he wrote. “@MagicEden I would be extremely careful using our name in a project that has not been approved and is unknown to anyone in our organization.”skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionOver the past several months, Trump’s family and business partners have debuted a web of crypto business and digital currencies – those include a memecoin with the image of Trump pumping his fist, and a stablecoin that is designed to maintain a constant value of $1.

Anthony Devlin / PAWhat are the signs and symptoms of breast cancer?The NHS says that there can be minimal signs and symptoms of breast cancer, which is why it is important to keep a close eye on what is normal for your own breasts.Typically, the first noticeable sign is usually a lump or area of thickened breast tissue.Experts say that most breast lumps are not cancerous, but it’s always best to have them checked by a doctor.You should also see a GP if you notice any of these symptoms:a change in the size or shape of one or both breastsdischarge from either of your nipples, which may be streaked with blooda lump or swelling in either of your armpitsdimpling on the skin of your breastsa rash on or around your nipplea change in the appearance of your nipple, such as becoming sunken into your breastThe CoppaFeel! website offers a lot of free resources and videos to help you check for breast cancer. They also offer guidance for trans and non-binary people, as well as people with breast implants. What are the causes of breast cancer?Experts do not know the exact causes of breast cancer because they differ from person to person. This makes it difficult to say why one woman may develop breast cancer and another may not.What doctors do know is that the likelihood of being diagnosed with breast cancer increases with age. That’s why over-50s in the UK are regularly invited for mammograms.All women who are between 50 and 70 should be screened for breast cancer every three years as part of the NHS Breast Screening Programme.There is also a heightened chance of catching breast cancer if you have a family history.There are also genes known as BRCA1 and BRCA2 which can increase your risk of developing both breast and ovarian cancer. It’s possible for these genes to be passed on from a parent to their child. Genetic tests can be carried out on the NHS to find out your likelihood of contracting the disease if you have a family history.There are other factors which may increase your risk. These are:Hormonal factors: Prolonged exposure to estrogen and progesterone, which can occur due to early menstruation, late menopause, or hormone replacement therapy, may increase the risk. Additionally, women who have never been pregnant or had their first pregnancy after the age of 30 may have a higher risk.Personal history of breast conditions: Some benign breast conditions, such as atypical hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), can increase the risk.Previous radiation therapy: Undergoing radiation therapy for the chest area, particularly during adolescence or early adulthood, can increase the risk later in life.Lifestyle factors: Certain lifestyle choices may contribute to the risk of breast cancer, including excessive alcohol consumption, obesity, a sedentary lifestyle, and smoking.How deadly is breast cancer?Survival after diagnosis depends on many different factors. These include:type and stage of cancerlevel of fitnessprevious treatmentCancer Research UK says that survival rates are “generally good, particularly if you are diagnosed early”. This is due to screening programmes, early diagnosis and improved treatment options in the UK.Cancer Research UK has survival statistics are available for each stage of breast\\xa0cancer in\\xa0England. The following figures are for women diagnosed between 2016 and 2020:Stage 1\\xa0Most women (almost 100 per cent) will survive their cancer for five years or more after diagnosis.Stage 2\\xa0Ninety out of 100 women (90 per cent) will survive their cancer for five years or more after diagnosis.Stage 3More than 70 out of 100 women (more than 70 per cent) will survive their cancer for five years or more after diagnosis.Stage 4More than 25 out of 100 women (more than 25 per cent)\\xa0will survive their cancer for five years or more after they are diagnosed. The cancer is not curable at this point, but can be controlled with treatment for some years.How can I check myself at home?The NHS says it is “vital” that women of all ages check their breasts regularly for any changes and always have any changes examined by a GP. There is no right or wrong way to check, but it is important to know what your “normal” is, so you will notice any changes.NHS guidance explains the best way to start:It reads: “Look at your breasts and feel each breast and armpit, and up to your collarbone. You may find it easiest to do this in the shower or bath, by running a soapy hand over each breast and up under each armpit.“You can also look at your breasts in the mirror. Look with your arms by your side and also with them raised.”\\n```\\n\\n## [Just one glass of America\\'s favorite drink \\'turbocharges\\' risk of deadliest form of colon cancer,...](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14768669/America-drink-colon-cancer-risk.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490) (#101158)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 08:08:48+00:00\\n\\n```\\n00:11, 04 Jun 2025, updated\\n09:08, 04 Jun 2025\\nBy\\nLUKE ANDREWS SENIOR HEALTH REPORTER FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\\nFor many Americans, cracking open a soda is a small daily indulgence — a fizzy treat paired with an otherwise balanced lifestyle.\\xa0But a new study suggests that even this seemingly innocent habit could be turbocharging one of the deadliest forms of cancer\\xa0striking young people today.Researchers have found a link between consuming at least one\\xa0sugary soda or candy every single day and late-stage colon cancer, the hardest-to-treat form of the illness.Nearly half of young adults, defined as under 50, with stage four cancer consumed at least one super sugary treat per day compared with fewer than 30 percent of patients with stage one to three colon cancers.They found no association between colon cancer and consumption of red meat, processed foods, fruit, vegetables, fish, poultry or dairy. It suggests a troubling link to sugar specifically.\\xa0Dr Emma Schatoff, a medical oncologist from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who led the study, told the Daily Mail: \\'Young people were coming in with metastatic disease, or cancer that had spread everywhere — it was in their liver, lungs, other organs - and they were very surprised.\\'We looked at anything that could have raised their risk level. We looked at inflammatory bowel disease and medication use, but found no difference there.\\xa0\\'Then we looked at diet, and found no link with processed foods or red meat. But we did find a link with high sugar foods in stage four patients diagnosed with the disease for the first time.\\' Heather Candrilli was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer last spring at 36 years old She added: \\'We defined a high sugar diet as daily consumption of high sugar foods, such as a [single] soda or a candy.\\'It is thought that sugar can cause damaging changes to the gut microbiome, which can lead to mutations in cells that result in tumors forming.An estimated 63 percent of Americans aged 18 or older report consuming at least one soda a day, according to the CDC.\\xa0The study included 303 colon cancer patients under 50 years old, of which 112 had stage four disease and 191 had stages one to three disease.Each filled in a dietary questionnaire to allow researchers to analyze their consumption and detect any possible links between their diets and disease.Patients were asked: \\'Two to five years before diagnosis, how often did you have one serving of high sugar foods (eg soft drinks, candy).\\'Overall, 45 percent of stage 4 patients reported daily consumption of high sugar foods.By comparison the share was 29 percent in the group with less advanced cancers. Consuming high sugar drinks could raise your risk of being diagnosed with advanced colon cancer, a study suggests\\nThe study concludes: \\'In a single center study, in early-onset colon cancer patients, high sugar diets may be associated with de novo [new] metastatic disease.\\'It was presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology\\'s annual conference in Chicago, Illinois, the biggest gathering of cancer researchers in the world, which is attended by 40,000 people.\\xa0The results have been published\\xa0as an abstract, and not yet in a scientific journal where they will be reviewed by other scientists.Scientists say that regularly consuming sodas can cause sugar to build-up in the colon when it cannot be fully absorbed, changing the gut microbiome and potentially boosting levels of inflammation.They also say sugar can be used as fuel for tumor cells which may cause the cancer to grow faster.A study published last year found that diets low in fiber and high in sugar spark the proliferation of a bacteria called Fusobacterium in the gut.This causes widespread inflammation in the gut, which has been shown to age cells, making them more vulnerable to cancer-causing mutations. Bailey Hutchins of Tennessee, pictured, died of colon cancer at just 26 years old In the new study 51 percent of patients were female. All had no previous cancer diagnosis and were under 50 years old.Individuals diagnosed with stage four were younger, at an average age of 41 years, compared to 43 years in the other group.Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the US and the second-leading cause of cancer deaths.The American Cancer Society estimates that 154,270 Americans will be diagnosed with colon cancer this year and 52,900 will die.In the UK 44,063 cases are diagnosed per year and the nation experiences 16,808 deaths every year.Since the 1990s early-onset colon cancer has increased by 50 percent and rates are expected to double between 2010 and 2030.\\n```\\n\\n## [Win for Added Relacorilant in Platinum-Resistant Ovarian Cancer](https://www.medpagetoday.com/meetingcoverage/asco/115907) (#106376)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 19:07:08+00:00\\n\\n```\\n5Aortic Aneurysm Risk and Somatic JAK2V617FVariation: Insights From a Multicenter, Population-Based Cardiovascular Screening Study.opens in a new tab or window\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

They have also sent alarms to automakers, plane manufacturers, home builders, oil drillers and other companies that rely on buying metals.\\nWhere the United States imported steel and aluminum from in 2024 Steel $32 bil.

The increase, from 25% to a staggering 50%, has once again rocked the markets as businesses question how much these chaotic measures are rooted in sound economic policy. While President Trump insists that the aim is to \"secure the future of the American steel industry”, the rest of the world is less convinced.His latest move is disquieting global markets, blindsiding businesses, and triggering retaliatory threats from confused allies who are now increasingly exasperated. In the midst of all this, the UK has been granted a so-called “carve-out”. British metals will remain subject to the original 25% tariff, so we’re technically no worse off. But let’s not kid ourselves – celebrating this exemption as a diplomatic triumph is a little pathetic. Especially when you consider that we’re not exactly a major steel exporter to the US in the first place.Trump’s trade moves are less the product of a coherent economic doctrine and more like a game of high-stakes whack-a-mole. For our politicians to interpret this moment as a post-Brexit victory misses the wider, and far more serious, picture. The volatility of Trump’s strategy leaves businesses, including those in America, paralysed.Companies that rely on steel and aluminium imports, such as Independent Can Co. in Maryland, which manufactures decorative tins, are halting investments, raising prices, and reconsidering their product lines altogether. When tariffs make plastic boxes more viable than metal ones, that’s not industrial revival. That’s strategic regression.And it’s not just cookie tins at stake. At Drill Rod & Tool Steels in Illinois, the director of supply chain management, Chad Bartusek, now faces nearly double the cost in tariffs for importing Austrian-made steel rods that the US simply doesn’t produce.That’s not national security. That’s economic masochism. In a now-familiar pattern, the markets are skittish, the economists are alarmed, and Trump is playing to the gallery. A 2020 analysis found that his first-term tariffs created roughly 1,000 steel jobs at the cost of 75,000 jobs elsewhere. Erica York of the Tax Foundation expects this new round of tariffs to be even more destructive, especially since intermediate inputs like steel are embedded in everything from cars to skyscrapers.It’s a textbook example of policy that scores political points while undermining productivity and employment.So yes, we’re technically off the hook, for now. But to use this as an excuse for complacency would be spectacularly short-sighted. Instead of basking in temporary tariff immunity, Britain should be treating this episode as a wake-up call.Our steel industry is already in a precarious position, and its decline can’t credibly be blamed on one man across the pond. If we want to be globally competitive, especially outside of the EU, we must prioritise self-reliance, efficiency, and, crucially, low energy costs.The Government’s reaction to this “carve-out” has been oddly smug, as though we’d outmanoeuvred the world’s most erratic chess player. But Trump’s tactics are transparent: slap on tariffs, then dial them back selectively to reward cooperation or leverage more favourable trade terms.The EU is in his sights now, with the 50% tariff now coming into effect. This, Trump hopes, will force Brussels to the table. On Truth Social, he accused the bloc of being “very difficult to deal with”, which, in fairness, is an improvement on his usual diplomatic finesse.

A recent ruling by three federal judges on the United States Court of International Trade blocked some of Trump’s worldwide tariffs, declaring them unlawful. The decision was prompted by a group of US businesses that argued that the president had exceeded his authority.The White House, naturally, has appealed. Because nothing says “market stability” like a protracted constitutional standoff over the separation of powers.None of this inspires confidence. For UK businesses and policymakers alike, the bigger message here is that we’re operating in an increasingly unstable global trading environment.Tariffs imposed (and lifted) on a whim, trade deals held hostage to political showmanship, and allies treated like adversaries. It’s all a bit exhausting. Worse still, it’s becoming the new normal.So yes, let’s bank the short-term relief that we’re not facing 50% tariffs. But let’s also remember that the man who promised to drain the swamp has instead filled the global trading pool with piranhas. Our best bet?Don’t wait around for the next feeding frenzy.

Its export controls mean companies must obtain regulatory approvals from Chinese authorities before shipping such minerals overseas.Authorities in places such as the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region and the provinces of Guizhou and Hunan have been inspecting exporters’ operations and cracking down on illegal mining as they implement a directive from Beijing that called for tighter “whole-chain” control over strategic mineral exports, the state-owned Securities Times reported on Monday.The moves come as Beijing continues to tighten its grip on global critical mineral supplies – a long-held ace in its dealings with Washington – after new US curbs on jet engine and chip design technology reignited bilateral tensions.Securities Times said Hunan, in Central China, has pledged to map out all its strategic mineral exporters and help them strengthen their compliance systems and ability to follow export rules.Guangxi, in South China, has vowed to step up supervision on the mining and exploration side, cracking down harder on illegal activities such as unlicensed extraction and mining outside approved areas.Two cities, Wuzhou in Guangxi and Yunfu in Guangdong province, have established a cross-regional coordination mechanism to crack down on illegal mining, the newspaper said.\\n```\\n\\n## [Starmer admits finalising his US trade deal could take WEEKS after Trump spares UK steel industry...](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14778761/Trump-UK-steel-industry-tariffs-exports-Starmer-trade-deal.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490) (#100341)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 12:32:43+00:00\\n\\n```\\nStarmer admits finalising his US trade deal could take WEEKS after Trump spares UK steel industry from latest 50% tariffs - but exports still face 25% levy\\n08:09, 04 Jun 2025, updated\\n13:32, 04 Jun 2025\\nBy\\nJAMES TAPSFIELD, POLITICAL EDITOR FOR MAILONLINE\\nKeir Starmer admitted finalising the US trade deal could take weeks today after the steel industry was spared from Donald Trump\\'s latest trade war salvo.The US president is offering \\'different treatment\\' to Britain after doubling tariffs on imports from other countries to 50 per cent.However, levies on UK steel and aluminium will remain at 25 per cent, as a Transatlantic trade agreement heralded by the PM\\xa0last month has still not been finalised.

Tariffs have been a big focus of President Donald Trump\\'s second term and many companies have announced price hikes to offset tariff costs.\\xa0Trump recently announced that new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports would kick in today, which could hit home appliances particularly hard. Experts say, you might pay more on your next vacuum, washing machine or refrigerator.\"We expect home appliance prices to rise this year, especially for mid-range and premium models that rely heavily on imported parts and materials,\" said David Warrick, executive vice president at Overhaul, a supply chain management platform, and former head of global supply chain technology at Microsoft. \"Refrigerators, dishwashers and washing machines are particularly vulnerable because they often include a high percentage of foreign components -- even when final assembly happens in the US.\"\\xa0CNET has been covering the Trump administration\\'s tariff policy and changes, and we\\'ve already seen manufacturers and retailers raise prices on laptops, toys and groceries. With home appliances, the price increases depend on a variety of factors, including where the appliance is assembled, where the parts come from and whether it has a semiconductor chip.\\xa0Here\\'s what you need to know about tariffs and how they could increase the price of home appliances this year.How do tariffs affect home appliance prices?We could see home appliance prices rise on products that are made in countries hit with tariffs. Because tariffs are paid by the importing company, the costs are typically passed along to the consumer in the form of higher prices, although the price hike may not be a 1-to-1 ratio with the tariff rate.This doesn\\'t only apply to assembled products that are made elsewhere and then shipped here to be sold. Many products that are assembled in the US involve imported components.\\xa0Materials like steel and aluminum are often imported and vulnerable to tariffs, as are pumps, motors and hoses, so appliances that include those parts could see notable price increases, according to Travis Tokar, a professor of supply chain management at Texas Christian University.How tariffs impact home appliance prices could also vary depending on the type of appliance, the size and where it\\'s manufactured. Larger appliances will be hit the hardest but right now it\\'s hard to predict precisely how much, said Babak Hafezi, CEO of HafeziCapital International Consulting & Investing and an adjunct professor at American University.The tariffs that most threaten home appliances include the 50% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports, the 25% tariff on imported goods from Mexico and Canada and the 30% tariff on imports from China. Higher tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China have been temporarily halted but this could change in the coming months.\"A lot of this will depend on the agreement with Mexico since many large appliances are assembled in Mexico,\" said\\xa0Patti Jordan, associate professor of professional practice at the Neely School of Business. \"Product[s] manufactured primarily in China, such as vacuum cleaners, air purifiers and small appliances, will most definitely be impacted.\"The Trump administration has also wavered on its tariff policy, making it difficult for the industry to predict what\\'s next. \"It\\'s the off-and-on tariff strategy that is leading to the supply chain instability more so than the tariffs -- at least so far,\" Buffington added.Could smart home appliances see even higher price hikes?There\\'s been talk of separate semiconductor tariffs from the Trump administration that could impact the prices of anything with a smart chip in it, including laptops and smart home tech. If initiated, an additional tariff on semiconductors could raise the cost of smart appliances even more.\"Smart appliances will absolutely feel the squeeze if semiconductor tariffs are implemented,\" Warrick said. \"These products -- think smart fridges, ovens, robotic vacuums -- depend on imported chips and modules. The more \\'smart\\' tech built into an appliance, the more exposed it becomes.\"Shawn DuBravac, CEO and president at Avrio Institute, a business technology research firm, added that lower-priced home appliances that use semiconductor technology might face even bigger price increase percentages, because these items have lower margins and are less able to absorb price increases.Experts also noted that it would be difficult for the government to know when a product has a semiconductor chip and price it appropriately. \"Managing this would seem to be impossible,\" said Jack Buffington, associate professor in supply chain management at the University of Denver. \"How would customs be able to determine which products have chips, where they are from, and would there be a tariff by chip or just one tax for any product with one chip?\"Because managing semiconductor tariff pricing would be complicated, it\\'s possible that home appliances, particularly those fully manufactured outside of the US, might avoid separate semiconductor tariffs altogether and instead be taxed at their product category rate for the exporting country.\"A product that is manufactured outside of the US and imported as a finished product would likely only face the tariff associated with the product category and would in turn avoid any semiconductor tariff,\" DuBravac said. However, home appliances that are manufactured in the US would likely face semiconductor tariffs if the component is imported.\\xa0Tariffs aren\\'t the only reason we\\'ll see appliance price hikesExperts expect home appliance prices to rise but tariffs aren\\'t the only culprit. Companies are also looking at other costs when deciding whether to hike prices.\"There are many factors that impact the price of a product besides a new tariff,\" Jordan said. \"Transportation costs, labor costs and material costs. Appliance manufacturers have to weigh in on the impact of each of these in order to determine the pricing of their product going forward.\"Which home appliances will see the biggest price hikes from tariffs?It\\'s difficult to predict which way the Trump administration will take its tariff strategy. Based on what\\'s currently implemented and future proposals, experts say the following appliances could see price hikes:Air purifiersRefrigeratorsWashers and dryersStovesSmall kitchen appliances like toaster ovens, air fryers and blendersVacuum cleanersAppliances with smart technology, like smart refrigerators or smart washers and dryers could see further increases if additional semiconductor tariffs are imposed. Here\\'s how high prices could rise for each type of home appliance.OK, appliance prices will likely rise. Should I buy now or wait?\\xa0Currently, the higher tariff pause for China is set to expire on Aug. 12. Most air purifiers would be exempt from the 25% tariffs on Mexico, but this agreement is also set to expire in July. Steel tariffs rose from 25% to 50% on June 4.That makes it tricky to decide if you should purchase a new appliance now or wait to see how President Trump\\'s tariff war pans out.\\xa0\"It is somewhat a roll of the dice right now,\" said Jordan. \"Right now, much of the inventory came into the US before the tariffs hit so now might be the right time to buy if it is in stock.\"\\xa0DuBravac agrees. \"My advice is: If you know you\\'ll need it soon, buy now. Prices are more likely to rise than fall in the near term as tariff policy uncertainty looms and importers adjust inventory strategies. Waiting could mean paying more later.\"\\xa0That doesn\\'t mean you should panic-buy a new appliance, though. Experts suggest turning to sales like Prime Day and Black Friday to help offset any cost increases.If you know you\\'re going to need a new appliance this year, work toward building a sinking fund -- a short-term savings plan -- and contribute money toward your fund with each paycheck. If you need to finance a purchase, factor in how much interest charges could add to your purchase. Interest rates are still high\\xa0so if you put the purchase on a credit card and can\\'t pay it off in full in one to two months, you might end up paying more than what a tariff would cost you.Will buying appliances secondhand help you save money?The second-hand shopping market has reignited in the wake of Trump\\'s tariffs and it could be a good way to compromise and fit an appliance purchase into your budget this year.Experts don\\'t expect the secondhand market to see price hikes directly from tariffs but note that it\\'s possible if the demand for secondhand products increases.\\xa0\"The secondhand market is a viable way to save -- at least in the short term,\" said Warrick, \"As new appliance prices rise, more consumers will start considering used options, which could push up demand and eventually prices in that space too. But for now, it\\'s a smart way to avoid tariff-driven sticker shock, especially for larger or smarter appliances.\"Shopping secondhand or repairing broken appliances won\\'t always save you money, either. Purchasing an older model or fixing certain appliances could cost you more than the machine is worth, said Buffington. \"For example, washing machines are around $400 to $1,000 so fixing an appliance or buying something that\\'s 5 years old may not make sense if the lifespan is 10 years.\"Is buying US-assembled appliances a viable option?Trump says one of the goals of his tariff policies is to encourage companies to ramp up manufacturing in the US. However, it\\'s not as simple as flipping a switch. Shifting manufacturing from overseas to the US would take time -- and it has its own set of costs that could impact prices.\"Clearly, the hope is that all these changes will lead to more \\'Made in the USA\\' products, but in reality we don\\'t have prepared industries to step in and begin producing these goods,\" said Josh Fischer, VP of product strategy at Cin7, an inventory management software developer. \"It\\'ll take years before we benefit from these changes, if at all.\"While you can find appliances that are assembled in the US, it doesn\\'t mean all of their parts were manufactured here. Many have components that are imported from other countries, which could hike up the price tag regardless of where it\\'s assembled.\"What\\'s happening in appliances is a microcosm of the larger supply chain story,\" Warrick said. \"Tariffs don\\'t just affect finished goods; they affect parts, sub-assemblies and even packaging. So even if a product is \\'Made in America,\\' if it contains foreign components, it\\'s still vulnerable.\"\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

Switch 2 versions of games cost more (ranging from $10 to $20 more), but you can just buy the Switch 2 game upgrades later for a similar price -- or play the versions you\\'ve already got minus the enhanced graphics and game extras. Zelda: Breath of the Wild looks nice on Switch 2, but it\\'s still great on the Switch. Numi Prasarn/CNETThe Switch 2\\'s current upgrades are good, but not shockingly goodAfter playing several of the Switch 2 Edition versions of Switch games for a bit, I noticed better frame rates and graphics resolution, but I honestly didn\\'t find it to be that much different. I\\'d prefer playing the enhanced Switch 2 editions, but the experience reminded me a bit of the PS5 Pro versus PS5 versions of games when I first played on the console with Sony last year.If you have a big TV, you\\'ll likely appreciate the difference. The bigger Switch 2 screen shows off games in higher-res 1080p with HDR, but you could play on the older Switch and be fine.

It\\'s unclear how well these games will play on the Switch versus Switch 2, but you can get a good dose of New Nintendo this year on the older hardware and upgrade the hardware upgrade later. Think of it as a bit of a FOMO buffer.Looking at Nintendo\\'s game history, the company often supported its previous consoles for a couple of years after the new hardware\\'s release. I\\'d expect that after 2026 the Switch 2 will start to become the go-to platform for most big games, but I wouldn\\'t be surprised to see a handful of key Nintendo games still supporting original Switch for another year at least. You can use the Switch 2 Joy-Cons like mice, which is cool, but also we\\'re curious to see how many games support this mode.

There are two new features you might envy: audio or video Game Chat among friends and the new Joy-Cons working like mice in some supported games. But Game Chat works only with other Switch 2 owners and needs a Switch Online subscription. The mouse functions are fun at times, but could also end up as just a gimmick. For now, the Switch 2 hasn\\'t pulled that many wild new functions out of its hat, but that could change, knowing Nintendo. There are also some fun camera-connected party game modes for Mario Party Jamboree if you happen to connect a camera, but no other games even have new camera-based features yet.It\\'s fine to wait, but tariffs are still a question markI\\'m saying this well before I\\'ve had a chance to review the Switch 2, and for sure, it looks like the best Nintendo console in a long while and worth upgrading to.

Will it fluctuate? I hope not, but the prices of Nintendo\\'s Switch 2 accessories have already gone up as a result of the Trump administration\\'s chaotic tariff policies, and it\\'s unclear if that might happen again.

The latest Switch console comes with a few big upgrades, including more storage, a bigger screen and higher video resolution. Let\\'s not forget about the long list of games, features and accessories like the camera, video chat and\\xa0Mario Kart World.\\xa0Gamers are ready for it.\\xa0CNET\\'s April survey found that more than half of US gaming adults (58%) were interested in buying the Switch 2 but were weighing a few factors first. Gamers were studying the price tag, researching\\xa0new available games\\xa0and considering the Nintendo franchise\\'s technology improvements.\\xa0The Switch 2 will cost $450. Nintendo has already unveiled new features that are expected to boost the console\\'s performance and family game playing.\\xa0CNET asked people what would entice them to buy the Switch 2, which will be available in stores on June 5. Here\\'s what we found out.\\xa0Read more:\\xa0Nintendo Switch 2 Launch: I Have the Switch 2 in Hand Now, Check It Out Key takeaways Over half of US adults who are active gamers (58%) are interested in upgrading to the Nintendo Switch 2.\\xa0Over one in four (27%) gaming adults say an affordable price would sway them to buy the Switch 2, followed by new games for the Nintendo franchise and improved technology.Younger generation gamers, including Gen Z (70%) and millennials (71%), are interested in buying the Switch 2.US gaming adults spend an average of $35 per month on new games and/or subscriptions, but Gen Z leads the way with an average of $56.\\xa0Gen Z hopes the Switch 2 will bring better games and performanceCNET found that 70% of Gen Z and 71% of millennial gamers are interested in the upcoming Switch model. What\\'s most interesting is Gen Z\\'s hopes for the new console and how they view gaming.\\xa0Nearly one in four (23%) of Gen Z respondents are looking forward to new games for Nintendo franchises, while 30% are looking forward to improved technology such as a bigger screen and better graphics. Above all, the top factor for deciding whether to buy the Switch was an affordable price (31%). CNET Editor-at-Large Scott Stein, who writes about gaming devices, wasn\\'t shocked by any of this. Watch this: I Attended the Public Nintendo Switch 2 Experience\\n05:25\"It definitely sounds like those results favor the Switch 2\\'s existence,\" Stein said.\\xa0Here\\'s a closer look at the factors Gen Z gamers and US gaming adults consider when deciding to upgrade to the Switch 2 and what experts think about the data.\\xa0Read more:\\xa0What You Need to Know About Nintendo Switch 2 Edition GamesThe No. 1 factor is the console priceNintendo\\'s newest console is now closer to other console prices like the Xbox Series X, costing $450, but $500 with the Mario Kart World bundle. In comparison, the first Switch cost $300 when it was released.\\xa0Even though the console is more expensive than CNET experts predicted, Gen Zers may be willing to pay since the Switch 2 offers more features, gaming availability and higher-resolution graphics.\\xa0 Watch this: We Played Nintendo Switch 2: Mario, Donkey Kong, Mouse, Camera and a Lot More\\n08:02\"It may seem high, but it\\'s right in line with higher-end handhelds like Steam Deck, and Windows handhelds are even more expensive. Plus, this comes with its own dock,\" Stein said.Stein pointed out that if Gen Zers love the usual Nintendo games, they\\'ll likely buy the newer Switch model. However, it could depend on how much support big-name publishers give the Switch 2 for popular games that could make the new console worth the sticker price for them. So far, Nintendo has announced close to 50 Switch 2 games, including a few classics that have a Switch 2 edition.\\xa0 Cole Kan/CNETIt\\'s all about the Switch\\'s performance and unique features, tooAs one of the youngest gaming generations, Gen Z hopes that Nintendo will deliver higher-resolution graphics with the upcoming release, which could meet Gen Z\\'s expectations -- like we see with PlayStation and Xbox. Since this generation was much younger when the first Nintendo Switch was first released, Stein said this is the first time they can weigh in on the Nintendo franchise\\'s graphics and capabilities.\\xa0Beyond graphics, Gen Z is also looking at what makes the Switch stand out.\\xa0For example, Nintendo announced that each Joy-Con can be used like a mouse to play compatible games, like Civilization 7. That might not move the needle for making the purchase, but Gen Z is looking for something different that will make the purchase worthwhile, said David Lumb, a senior reporter at CNET.\\xa0They\\'re spending more on gaming, but intentionally\\xa0Even though the younger generation is weighing the console price, let\\'s not forget about the No. 1 factor for the younger generation considering the Switch 2: the availability of games. \"Gen Z, with its disposable income, is choosing to focus on a couple of games and going a little bit on that, rather than having a broader [array] of games, especially if their socialization is based on those one or two games,\" Lumb said.\\xa0Lumb also said there\\'s a chance Gen Z will initially wait to see if more games come out to justify the price of the Switch 2, especially since they already have forever games they\\'re socially playing with friends.\\xa0Yet this generation spends the most on subscriptions and gaming.\\xa0Gen Z spends an average of $56 per month on subscriptions and/or new games, compared with US gaming adults as a whole, spending an average of $35 per month. That\\'s an additional $252 per year for the youngest surveyed generation.\\xa0Beyond buying new games and paying for subscriptions, there\\'s a chance this monthly amount could be spent on in-game purchases for games that Gen Z gamers may only buy once a year. However, they could spend the monthly amount on customization, upgrades and other in-game purchases, said Lumb. For example, think about in-game cosmetics and items you can purchase in Fortnight, which will also be available on the Switch 2.\\xa0 Cole Kan/CNETRead more: Best Nintendo Switch Deals: Grab the Switch OLED and Get Super Mario Bros Wonder for FreeWhy the Switch 2 is gaining traction for US gamersThe gaming world has evolved since the first Switch hit the scene. Nowadays, 4K graphics, virtual reality, streaming,\\xa0game subscriptions\\xa0and social play are increasingly important to many gamers. The new Switch has the opportunity to catch up to the technology of competitors like the\\xa0Xbox Series X\\xa0and\\xa0Sony PlayStation 5\\xa0while maintaining a family-friendly, portable format that\\'s more accessible to everyone.More than half (58%) of US adults that game want to buy the Nintendo Switch 2. The big question is why.\\xa0For loyal Switch gamers, the format and games are fun, and gamers are ready for the next iteration of it, Lumb said.\\xa0\"I think it\\'s just people are excited to see the next version of this, but I also think it\\'s excitement, not a guarantee people are going to buy it,\" Lumb said. Here\\'s what would persuade US adults to buy the new Switch.\\xa0The big Switch 2 moments our editors and gamers\\xa0The Nintendo Switch 2 has a few rumored upgrades, including a bigger display and magnetic Joy-Cons. Here\\'s what else gamers and our experts are looking forward to based on survey findings and the latest Nintendo Direct. \\xa0Better performance to lure popular games\\xa0Aside from the price of the console, the two biggest factors for buying the Switch are improved technology and game availability. However, to have both, big-name popular games need better performance to offer more than Nintendo\\'s usual titles.\\xa0Nintendo hasn\\'t been focused on performance like Xbox and PlayStation -- which perform similarly to a personal computer, said Lumb. Instead, it has focused on offering unique games.\\xa0\"Nintendo is really going for style over the latest and greatest, which is fun. However, the original Switch suffered in terms of porting top-end games,\" said Lumb. \"So hopefully, we will see a performance boost to at least be able to get a decent amount of these leading games.\"\\xa0A few big-name game titles are coming to Nintendo, including WWE 2K, The Duskbloods and Civilization 7 -- the first mouse strategy game for the Switch 2. Nintendo will also offer GameShare for three systems to play a compatible game. \\xa0A new Nintendo subscription plan\\xa0Currently, Nintendo offers Nintendo Switch Online, which allows cloud data storage, online gameplay and a library of Nintendo games. Our editors were eager to see if Nintendo\\'s big announcement would include changes to the existing subscription to offer more to gamers. And Nintendo delivered.\\xa0Nintendo Switch Online is getting a few new features, including live game chat, which will be available only for the Switch 2. Game chat will require a Nintendo Switch Online subscription after March 2026. Nintendo will offer expansion packs for games that you may already have but want to upgrade for the Switch 2. The biggest shock was the Nintendo Gamecube library for Switch 2 users, too.\\xa0 Watch this: Live Video Chat Comes to the Nintendo Switch 2\\n05:43Special features and upgraded technology\\xa0Beyond the long list of games, Nintendo has an extensive list of new features and accessories coming this year that could meet gamers\\' expectations. You\\'ll be able to play Switch 2 games at up to 120 frames per second, have better sound quality with the console\\'s built-in mic, and have 256GB of internal storage.\\xa0Plus, Nintendo announced a Nintendo Switch Camera, a new Switch 2 controller and a Gamecube controller.\\xa0\"It\\'s funny because we always write off Nintendo as not being about graphics or necessarily about tech, but they do have moments that they push the envelope on tech,\" Stein said.The Nintendo Switch will also be backward compatible, as Stein hoped. That means your older Switch games will be compatible with later Switch models and the Switch 2, though you might encounter some compatibility issues. Stein said that would be welcoming news for loyal Nintendo customers, who may consider buying the Switch 2 later on. And when they do, they\\'d already have a library of games at the ready.MethodologyAll figures, unless otherwise stated, are from YouGov Plc. The total sample size was 2,369 adults, of which 1,290 were gamers. Fieldwork was undertaken between March 19 and 25, 2025. The survey was carried out online.

These JavaScripts load on users\\' mobile browsers and silently connect with native apps running on the same device through localhost sockets.”What Meta and Yandex have essentially done is create a crack in the Android sandbox environments through which they can extract website data and cookies, bypassing inbuilt security and privacy protections, and then associating the data with the user’s device identifiers such as their identity within a Meta app, or the user’s Android Advertising ID.Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!When probed about the covert tracking method by The Register, a Meta spokesperson said, “We are in discussions with Google to address a potential miscommunication regarding the application of their policies. Upon becoming aware of the concerns, we decided to pause the feature while we work with Google to resolve the issue.”According to the researchers, Yandex has been using this method of covert tracking since 2017, while Meta started in September 2024.Firefox and Chromium-based web browsers were the primary target of the web data extraction, with Meta and Yandex able to extract cookies that should be otherwise inaccessible due to cookie clearing, Incognito browsing, and Android\\'s app permission system.A Google representative told Ars Technica, “The developers in this report are using capabilities present in many browsers across iOS and Android in unintended ways that blatantly violate our security and privacy principles,” the representative said, in reference to the developers who built the code behind Meta Pixel and Yandex Metrica. “We\\'ve already implemented changes to mitigate these invasive techniques and have opened our own investigation and are directly in touch with the parties.”You might also likeEncrypt your internet traffic with the best VPNsSecure your device against malware with the best antivirus software\"Meta AI non-compliant with GDPR\" – Digital rights group menaces Meta with injunction over EU AI training\\nBenedict has been writing about security issues for over 7 years, first focusing on geopolitics and international relations while at the University of Buckingham.

According to recent research, both companies have exploited legitimate browser-to-app communication protocols to covertly link anonymous web activity with the identities of users logged into native apps like Facebook, Instagram, and various Yandex services on Android devices.\\nThe research, extensively analyzed by Ars Technica, focuses on the widespread use of analytics scripts such as Meta Pixel and Yandex Metrica. These tools are embedded across millions of websites, ostensibly to help advertisers track campaign performance. However, behind the scenes, they enable a process that circumvents the privacy protections built into Android and major web browsers.\\nAt the core of the issue is the exploitation of Android\\'s permissive local port communication. While Android\\'s sandboxing and browser storage partitioning are intended to keep web and app data siloed, Meta and Yandex have discovered methods to bypass these safeguards, effectively enabling cross-app tracking.\\nThe trackers send unique web identifiers – such as cookies – through local ports monitored by their corresponding apps. This allows Meta and Yandex to link a user\\'s browsing history directly to their app account, even when users are browsing in private or incognito modes.\\n\"What this attack vector allows is to break the sandbox that exists between the mobile context and the web context,\" Narseo Vallina-Rodriguez, one of the researchers who uncovered the practice, told Ars Technica. \"The channel that exists allowed the Android system to communicate what happens in the browser with the identity running in the mobile app.\"\\nThe technical implementation is complex but revealing. Meta Pixel, for instance, has employed a variety of methods since September of last year. Initially, it sent HTTP requests to port 12387; it later transitioned to using the WebSocket protocol over the same port.\\nLater, Meta adopted WebRTC, a protocol typically used for real-time communications like video calls. By manipulating Session Description Protocol SDP data through a technique known as SDP munging, Meta Pixel was able to embed tracking cookies into fields intended for connection information. This data was then sent as part of a STUN request to the local host, where the Facebook or Instagram app could intercept it and associate the activity with a specific user identity.\\nYandex Metrica has employed similar tactics since at least 2017, sending HTTP and HTTPS requests to designated local ports monitored by its apps. Both Meta Pixel and Yandex Metrica are estimated to be embedded on millions of websites, with Meta Pixel alone found on approximately 5.8 million.\\nGoogle, the steward of Android, has acknowledged the abuse, stating that it violates both Play Store policies and user privacy expectations. \"The developers in this report are using capabilities present in many browsers across iOS and Android in unintended ways that blatantly violate our security and privacy principles,\" a Google spokesperson said. The company has implemented some mitigations and is investigating further.\\nMeta, for its part, has paused the feature and is currently in discussions with Google. \"We are in discussions with Google to address a potential miscommunication regarding the application of their policies. Upon becoming aware of the concerns, we decided to pause the feature while we work with Google to resolve the issue,\" according to a statement by the company.\\nYandex has also stated that it is discontinuing the practice. The company claims it does not de-anonymize user data and insists the feature was intended solely to improve personalization within its apps.\\nSome browsers have taken proactive measures. DuckDuckGo and Brave, for instance, have blocked the abusive JavaScript and associated domains, preventing identifiers from being sent to Meta and Yandex.\\nVivaldi, another Chromium-based browser, still forwards identifiers to local ports unless tracker blocking is enabled. Chrome and Firefox have rolled out targeted fixes, though researchers warn these are only partial solutions that could be bypassed with minor modifications to the trackers\\' code.\\nGunes Acar, the researcher who first discovered Meta Pixel\\'s local port access, emphasized that the dynamic between browser developers and trackers remains fluid. He described efforts to block these techniques as an ongoing struggle.\\n\"Any browser doing blocklisting will likely enter into a constant arms race, and it\\'s just a partial solution. Creating effective blocklists is hard, and browser makers will need to constantly monitor the use of this type of capability to detect other hostnames potentially abusing localhost channels and then updating their blocklists accordingly.\"\\n```\\n\\n## [Adidas data breach reveals customer info in vendor attack](https://www.foxnews.com/tech/adidas-data-breach-reveals-customer-info-vendor-attack) (#101349)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 14:00:20+00:00\\n\\n```\\nNEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!\\nHackers are no longer targeting only tech giants or hospitals. Any business that collects valuable personal information, such as names, phone numbers, email addresses or even basic financial details, is now a target.Companies that rely heavily on third-party vendors or outsourced customer support are even more at risk, especially if they are not particularly strong in the technology sector.German retailer Adidas learned this the hard way. The company recently confirmed a data breach involving one of its external partners, and although it has acknowledged the issue, many important details are still missing.Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to my\\xa0free \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\" when you sign up!\\xa0 A hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)Adidas confirms vendor breach: Here’s what we knowAdidas has officially acknowledged that a third-party vendor suffered a breach, resulting in unauthorized access to consumer data. In a\\xa0public notice titled \"Data Security Information,\" the company revealed that a \"third-party customer service provider\" had been compromised. While the brand was initially silent on the scope, it had already been reported earlier this month that customers in Turkey and Korea had received breach notifications.MASSIVE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 184 MILLION PASSWORDS AND LOGINSAdidas posted this information on both its German and English websites. However, no specific region or number of affected individuals has been confirmed. The company’s statement did clarify that no payment information, such as credit card details, nor passwords were included in the breach. Instead, it involved contact details submitted by users to Adidas’ help desk in the past.Data obtained reportedly includes names, phone numbers, email addresses and dates of birth. While this might seem limited compared to financial data, this type of information can be exploited for phishing scams and identity theft.\\xa0 An Adidas sign (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)What Adidas told customers after the breachIn the wake of the breach, Adidas began notifying potentially affected customers directly. The company\\'s email to customers below aimed to reassure recipients and clarify what information was involved. Here is the full text of the notification sent to affected individuals.Dear customer,We are writing to inform you of an issue that we recently became aware of which may have impacted some of your data.What happenedadidas recently learned that an unauthorized external party gained access to certain customer data through a third-party customer service provider.What information was involvedThe affected data does not contain passwords, credit card or any other payment-related information. Nor have any Social Security numbers been impacted.It mainly consists of contact information relating to customers who had contacted our customer service help desk in the past.

WHY IT\\'S HARDER THAN YOU THINK\\xa0What Adidas hasn’t said about the vendor hackDespite the official acknowledgment, several questions remain unanswered. Adidas has yet to clarify whether this is a single breach affecting multiple regions or several separate incidents. The lack of transparency around the name of the third-party vendor and the absence of concrete numbers or locations for affected users has created frustration among observers and possibly among customers themselves.The earlier regional reports from Turkey and Korea might suggest that this incident was either global in scale or that similar third-party vendors were independently targeted. In either case, the company\\'s current handling of the situation has left room for speculation. Adidas claims it is in the process of informing potentially affected customers, but it has not detailed the method or timeline for this outreach.We reached out to adidas for a comment, and a representative referred us to this statement on their\\xa0website.

The video showed Lee in a dark suit and a royal-blue tie, the color of his Democratic Party. He looked weary and frightened. “Our democracy is collapsing,” he said. “Please come together to protect it.”The nation’s President, Yoon Suk-yeol, who was a prosecutor before being groomed for leadership by the People Power Party, had spent the past few years turning the machinery of the state against political opponents, trade unions, and journalists who criticized him. Now he had declared martial law and sent troops to lock down the parliamentary complex. But Lee and his allies hoped that they could prevail: because of South Korea’s recent history of military dictatorships, its constitution allows the legislature to constrain orders of martial law. The night that Lee issued his call, thousands of citizens showed up at the National Assembly. They helped Democratic Party legislators, and even a few conservatives typically aligned with Yoon, make their way past the soldiers and break into the building to vote down the order. It was an uncommon instance of coöperation across party lines in extreme circumstances—and, I argued at the time, a model for fighting authoritarianism elsewhere.A great deal has happened since. From December through April, there were ecstatic daily protests, demanding that Yoon be ousted. These were followed by Yoon’s impeachment by the National Assembly, his criminal indictment, his formal removal by the Constitutional Court—and, this Tuesday, a snap election to replace him. In the 2022 Presidential election, Lee lost to Yoon by less than one per cent. This time, he won by more than eight points. He will be inaugurated on Wednesday, beginning a five-year term.Lee is sixty-one years old, a scrapper with a potent backstory. He grew up in poverty, in the eastern part of the country, and got a job instead of attending middle school; his left arm was later crushed in a factory accident, causing it to splay at the elbow. He went on to become a human-rights lawyer, a mayor, and the governor of Korea’s most populous province. He has pushed redistributive policies, including universal basic income, while sticking to the Democratic mainstream. He is pro-development and pro-welfare state, loyal to the United States but respectably independent. Last year, he survived an assassination attempt at a public appearance: a man in his sixties, posing as a supporter and wearing a paper crown that read “I am Lee Jae-myung,” plunged a knife into his neck. The attacker had written a screed saying that he intended to save Korea from “left-wing forces.”Lee has been involved in numerous controversies. In the early two-thousands, he was found to have misrepresented himself as a prosecutor to help a journalist investigate a mayor suspected of corruption; he was accused of having an extramarital affair; his son reportedly posted misogynistic comments online. He has faced multiple prosecutions, including one for lying about his relationship to a real-estate developer during an election debate, in 2021. (Korea strictly regulates election-related speech; that case was appealed and is on hold.) The episodes provoked criticism that was often tinged with classist disdain; conservatives described Lee as a “petty criminal” who swims in “dirty waters.” But a liberal friend also surprised me by writing him off as “dangerous” and “too messy” to run the country. Far-right and evangelical groups targeted him for his views, labelling him a “pinko commie” and organizing campaigns to smear him online.In the recent election, Lee’s main rival was Kim Moon-soo, a former labor minister who served as Yoon’s proxy. Kim is not a dynamic presence, but he upheld the party line. In one of three debates, he called Lee the country’s “most corrupt government official.” He argued that Yoon had been driven to declare martial law because Lee and the rest of the Democratic Party had repeatedly blocked legislation in the National Assembly. The People Power Party downplayed the attempted self-coup as a silly misstep. “There was quick action to lift the martial law, and it got lifted, didn’t it?” Kim said in the final debate.I travelled around Korea in the days leading up to the election. In Cheonan, one of Kim’s campaign trucks blared music, while a surrogate shouted slogans through a muffled P.A. system. In Namyangju, a city in the province where Lee was governor, banners read, “A vote in this election is a win for the people” and “Cast your vote to stop the treason!” Early voters in Seoul took selfies outside a polling station; there were long lines and lots of buzz, mostly in Lee’s favor.Nearly eighty per cent of eligible voters turned out—Election Day was a national holiday—but at the polls I visited the mood was subdued. I kept thinking about two other recent elections. The first was the Korean snap election in 2017, to replace President Park Geun-hye. Its contours were nearly identical to this year’s: misconduct by a conservative President, months of mass protests, impeachment, removal, criminal prosecution, and the election of a liberal replacement—Moon Jae-in, who, like Lee, had been a human-rights lawyer. The second was the U.S. election of 2020, which Joe Biden framed as a plebiscite on a dangerously venal leader, and which came just after that year’s Black Lives Matter demonstrations, the largest in American history. Both Moon and Biden campaigned on who they were not—presenting themselves as antidotes or correctives—while promising not to forget the social movements that brought them to power. Both ended up struggling to hold their country together, let alone effect the changes that their activist supporters had hoped to see.What will come of the resistance to Yoon? The movement—large, diverse, and energetic—was largely sustained by young women, who waved “Impeach Yoon” signs to the beat of K-pop and adapted flashing L.E.D. batons, concertgoers’ accessories, to the purpose of ousting a would-be autocrat. Yoon had made women-bashing a core principle. As a candidate and as President, he had fixated on abolishing South Korea’s gender ministry, and implied that feminism was the cause of many social ills, such as overpriced housing, underemployment among young men, and a record-low fertility rate. He surrounded himself with military generals. In a different world, the Democratic Party would have chosen a woman—perhaps a member of the National Assembly, which is about one-fifth female—to run for President to succeed Yoon, pushing for an omnibus anti-discrimination law that has been a perennial goal of women and minority groups.Instead, Lee largely avoided questions of gender during the campaign, and made no particular appeal to the labor movement or to poor people, constituencies he had previously courted. Determined not to alienate all of Yoon’s supporters, he called himself a “real conservative”—as distinct from the radicals who would institute martial law. Yet, as polls showed him taking a comfortable lead, Lee began to sound more like his old self. “Do you know why they’re against Lee Jae-myung?” he said to a crowd in Cheongju last weekend, referring to himself in the third person. “It’s because Lee Jae-myung is from the periphery. He’s on the side of small and medium-sized businesses, not big corporations. He stands with the poor and working class.”Lee wants to go beyond correcting Yoon’s strongman Presidency. But his victory feels more like a reassertion of reality than a referendum on the values of either major party. It is a vote against Yoon and others who would embrace a return to the military dictatorships of the nineteen-seventies and eighties. “Finally, that day of martial law is over,” said a man who celebrated the results in front of the National Assembly, to the news site Pressian.In office, Lee must contend with an unenviable pile of problems. Though some seventeen million voters got behind him, there is no consensus; the nation is split—by gender, class, and geography—and recovering from a prolonged political trauma, including multiple Presidential impeachments and prosecutions. The other, historic split, from North Korea, continues to inspire an arms buildup and a lingering paranoia over Communism. South Korea’s unemployment rate is around three per cent, but higher for younger workers. About half of the population lives in greater Seoul, for lack of jobs in the provinces. Outside Lee’s campaign headquarters, I attended a rally meant to highlight the precarious conditions of temporary and subcontracted employees; a few days later, a subcontracted worker died in a lathe accident at a power plant that was known to be unsafe. The auto and semiconductor industries, which together supplied more than thirty per cent of Korea’s exports in 2024, have been stunned by Donald Trump’s whipsawing tariffs.Still, Lee has reason to feel optimistic. His win is the sign of a functioning democracy and a refutation of authoritarianism. Late last night, on a stage near the National Assembly, he raised his good arm and pumped a fist to the chants of the crowd. “The people are the masters of this country,” he said. “The President’s job is to bring the people together.”\\xa0♦\\n```\\n\\n## [South Korea elects liberal Lee as president](https://theweek.com/world-news/lee-south-korea-new-president) (#99824)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 16:02:30+00:00\\n\\n```\\nSouth Korean President Lee Jae-myung makes a heart gesture after inauguration\\n(Image credit: Lee Young-ho / Sipa / Bloomberg via Getty Images)\\npublished\\n4 June 2025\\nWhat happenedLee Jae-Myung was sworn in as South Korea\\'s president today after his main challenger, conservative former labor minister Kim Moon-soo, conceded defeat this morning.

Despite the country’s strikingly high household debt, the central bank last week lowered borrowing costs in a desperate bid to inject more money into the economy and slashed its 2025 growth forecast to 0.8%, which would be the weakest since a 0.7% contraction during the COVID-19 crisis in 2020.Lee won’t have much time to negotiate with Washington before July 9, when Trump’s 90-day pause in global reciprocal tariffs is set to expire, potentially exposing South Korean products to 25% tax rates. Although a U.S. federal court recently ruled that Trump lacks authority to impose his planned tariffs, the White House has appealed, leaving the outcome uncertain. Trump has also pushed for product-specific tariffs on key sectors like autos and semiconductors, which make up a major share of South Korean exports. Trump could also seek a broader deal requiring Seoul to pay significantly more for the 28,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea to deter North Korean threats.While Seoul’s previous government had aimed to reach a “package” deal with Trump by early July, Lee has preached patience on tariffs, saying it would be against national interests to obsess with an early agreement. In his inaugural address, Lee promised to reopen a communication channel with North Korea to ease tensions. But prospects for the early resumption of dialogue between the rival Koreas are dim, as North Korea has been constantly rejecting dialogue offers by South Korea and the U.S. since 2019, when talks between Washington and Pyongyang collapsed over disagreements on economic sanctions. North Korea’s priority in foreign policy is now firmly Russia, which has received thousands of North Korean troops and large amounts of military equipment in recent months for its warfighting in Ukraine. During campaigning, Lee acknowledged that it would be “very difficult” to arrange a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un anytime soon, though it’s something he will seek. Lee said he would support Trump’s efforts to restart nuclear diplomacy with Kim, saying that improved ties between Pyongyang and Washington could allow aid projects for the impoverished North that will likely require South Korean support.Lee nominated former Unification Minister Lee Jong-seok, a dove who espouses reconciliation with North Korea, as his spy chief. The nomination likely reflects Lee Jae-myung’s hopes to revive inter-Korean dialogue, given the behind-the-scene roles of the National Intelligence Service played to reach out to Pyongyang under the past liberal governments. However, many experts also note that Lee Jae-myung does not share the same level of Korean nationalist zeal as his liberal predecessors, and they question how firmly he would stick to his appeasement approach if provocative actions by North Korea, such as high-profile missile tests or border incursions, undermine public support for his policy at home.Lee was previously accused by his critics of tilting toward Pyongyang and Beijing and away from Washington and Tokyo. He once slammed a U.S. missile defense system in South Korea as a source of tensions and likened strengthening U.S.-Japan ties to a 1905 Washington-Tokyo agreement that he said eventually helped Japan colonize the Korean Peninsula. But Lee has recently refrained from making similar contentious comments, instead repeatedly pledging to pursue pragmatic diplomacy. He has vowed to enhance South Korea’s alliance with the U.S. and their trilateral cooperation with Japan, while also emphasizing the need to reduce tensions with North Korea and avoid frictions with China and Russia.While Lee may eventually take steps to improve ties with North Korea and China — relations that deteriorated under Yoon, who prioritized the U.S. and Japan — experts say Lee is unlikely to take drastic actions that might undermine the alliance with Washington or negatively impact South Korea\\'s financial markets.Lee has stated that he will address thorny historical disputes with Japan separately from matters of security, trade, and other issues. However, many experts believe he is unlikely to completely reverse the progress made in Seoul-Tokyo relations in recent years. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said Wednesday that he hopes to hold summit talks with Lee “as early as possible” and expressed a desire to further strengthen bilateral ties.Long accused by critics of being a divisive populist, Lee pledged unity throughout his campaign, vowing not to target conservatives and calling for an end to South Korea’s deep political polarization and a return to dialogue and compromise.However, he has also pledged a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding Yoon’s martial law stunt — a saga that could continue to overshadow Lee’s presidency and spark tensions with conservatives, especially as the ousted conservative faces a high-stakes criminal trial on rebellion charges punishable by death or life imprisonment.While Yoon defended his martial law decree as a necessary response to what he called the Democratic Party’s abuse of its legislative majority to obstruct his agenda, that same majority now gives Lee a far more favorable environment to advance his policies. Conservatives have voiced concern that this could give Lee partially unchecked power and enable him to advance legislation that shields his presidency from his own legal troubles.Lee faces five separate trials on corruption and other charges, but the hearings were suspended ahead of Tuesday’s election. While South Korea’s constitution shields sitting presidents from most criminal prosecution aside of rebellion or treason, it doesn’t clearly state whether this protection extends to preelection indictments. The Democrats have been pushing to revise the criminal procedure law to keep Lee’s trials suspended during his term, drawing criticism from conservatives.\\n```\\n\\n## [South Korea has endured 6 months of political turmoil. What can we expect in Lee\\'s presidency?](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/south-korea-endured-6-months-political-turmoil-expect-122478153) (#102487)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 07:42:28+00:00\\n\\n```\\nSEOUL, South Korea -- Images from the election of South Korea\\'s new president, liberal Lee Jae-myung, are everything you’d expect to see in one of the world’s most vibrant democracies. Peaceful. Orderly. And, because this is South Korea, compulsively eye-catching, with crowds singing raucously along to blaring K-pop, dancers bouncing in closely choreographed sequences, and color-coordinated outfits for the two front-runners and their supporters — blue for Lee, who was inaugurated Wednesday for a single, five-year term, red for the distant runner-up, conservative Kim Moon Soo.What the pictures don’t capture is the absolute turmoil of the past six months, making Tuesday one of the strangest — and, possibly, most momentous -- election days since the country emerged in the late 1980s from decades of dictatorship.Since Dec. 3, South Koreans have watched, stunned, as an extraordinary sequence of events unfolded: Then-South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law, a first since the dictatorship. In response, lawmakers, leaping fences and jostling with heavily armed soldiers, elbowed their way into a besieged parliament to vote the declaration down. Yoon was then impeached and removed from office and now, just two months after his fall, another president has taken office. Here is a look at Lee’s victory, the startling events that set up the election, and the challenges Lee faces to heal a nation split along a host of political and social fault lines.They are, in a way, older than the nation.The Korean Peninsula was initially divided into a Soviet-backed north and U.S.-backed south after World War II. The states formalized the division in 1948, and the 1950-53 Korean War made it permanent, dividing the rivals along the Demilitarized Zone, one of the most heavily armed borders in the world. But the tensions go beyond geography. During the long fight for democracy during South Korea\\'s dictatorships, several fractures arose that persist today: the contentions between liberals and conservatives, but also gaps between rich and poor, old and young and men and women.Since the end of dictatorship, over and over the country has seen its democracy tested.By its own leaders.By its antagonistic neighbor to the north.By each new generation’s reaction to a tumultuous history of forced geographic division, war, dictatorship, and one of the most breakneck economic turnarounds in world history. Preceding Tuesday’s election, thousands of protesters took to the streets, both supporting the deposed Yoon and denouncing him.“Above all, the president must bring unity among a divided and confused public, which was caused by the martial law declaration,” Park Soo Hyun, a 22-year-old student, said Wednesday.Lee\\'s party has a majority in parliament that will presumably allow the new president a freer hand in pushing through liberal legislation, including more funding for welfare programs and policies to address high living costs, joblessness and corruption.Typically, liberals like Lee have been more wary of South Korea\\'s traditional allies, the United States and Japan, than conservatives. They have also often looked for reconciliation with North Korea. The United States sees South Korea as a crucial buttress against China and Russia and North Korea’s growing nuclear capabilitie s. The South hosts nearly 30,000 U.S. troops.Lee, however, will have to find a way to keep his liberal base happy while managing the relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump, who has threatened Seoul with tariffs and has generally been lukewarm about the importance of the alliance. Lee has also been dogged by a raft of corruption cases, and it’s not yet clear how much of a drag those will be on his presidency. \"I will make sure there is no more military coup d’état, in which the power entrusted by the people would never be used to intimidate people,” Lee said in his victory speech early Wednesday morning, referring to the martial law decree.Experts say it\\'s a little of both. The last half-year has worsened already raw divisions, even as it highlighted the underlying strength of a rough-and-tumble democratic process.“Fierce ideological divisions still infuse politics, which could impede South Korea’s chances to grow into a truly mature democracy,\" Duyeon Kim, a visiting professor at Yonsei University in Seoul, wrote recently for the Council on Foreign Relations. But Tuesday’s vote and Wednesday’s inauguration signaled a return to a more normal democracy. And even the crisis itself showed the resiliency of South Korea\\'s institutions. A crowd helped lawmakers get past troops and into parliament to overturn the martial law decree. The soldiers who carried out Yoon’s orders did so without enthusiasm and didn’t use force against the people, John Delury, a Korea expert and visiting professor at John Cabot University, said Tuesday.Korean democracy is in the people’s hands, he said, not any one person’s, even the new president\\'s. Lee “enters office with a strong mandate. But he is not the savior of democracy,\" said Delury. \"Korean people saved it themselves. Now they are entrusting him not to do any more damage to it for the next five years.”\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

NAC was the only inhibitor against calcium oxalate crystal aggregation.The findings support roles of these supplements in kidney stone disease prevention, the authors suggested. “It will take a while before we can draw a clear conclusion that prescribing these supplements would really be beneficial to kidney stone patients, without any harms,” Thongboonkerd acknowledged. Next steps would include validating the in vitro findings in clinical settings.This study received funding from the National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT): High-Potential Research Team Grant Program (N42A660625). Thongboonkerd disclosed having no conflicts of interest.Marilynn Larkin, MA, is an award-winning medical writer and editor whose work has appeared in numerous publications, including Medscape Medical News and its sister publication MDedge, The Lancet (where she was a contributing editor), and Reuters Health.\\n```\\n\\n## [The Mediterranean Diet Look-a-Like: Meet the Planetary Health Diet](https://www.cnet.com/health/the-mediterranean-diet-look-a-like-meet-the-planetary-health-diet/#ftag=CAD590a51e) (#101957)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 13:00:03+00:00\\n\\n```\\nBy now, you have probably heard of the Mediterranean diet, and for good reason. It was named the best diet overall by US News and World Report for the eighth year in a row. The diet recommends meals filled with fruits and vegetables, whole grains, healthy fats and oils, seafood and lean poultry. If you have been interested in the Mediterranean diet, there\\'s now another popular, similar diet to try. The planetary health diet also encourages plant-based eating, but it has a special emphasis on sustainability for the planet. Here\\'s what a nutrition expert has to say about this diet and whether it\\'s worth it for you and the environment. \\xa0What is the planetary health diet?The planetary health diet was developed by the non-profit EAT-Lancet Commission in 2019. The organization is dedicated to a global sustainable food system that\\'s healthy for humans and the planet. By 2050, it\\'s estimated that the world population will be close to 10 billion. The EAT-Lancet Commission created and continually promotes the planetary health diet to ensure we will have enough food to feed all people and a healthy planet we can all live on.\\xa0\"The planetary health diet is considered a plant-based or plant-strong [diet], in alignment with the health and environmental benefits seen from vegetarian and vegan diets,\" said Vanessa King, spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. This means that the planetary diet consists of lots of fruit, non-starchy vegetables, nuts and legumes. It also includes whole grains, plant-sourced proteins and unsaturated plant oils. While it also allows for starchy vegetables, added sugars, dairy and animal-sourced meats, the approved amounts are smaller.\\xa0 A planetary health diet visual\\xa0 EAT-Lancet Commission\"The diet aims to nourish a growing global population while reducing the environmental impact of food production,\" said\\xa0Debbie Petitpain, MBA, RD, spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.\\xa0The keeping and production of animal products, especially red meats, have a high carbon footprint on the planet. Peitipain continued: \"[The planetary diet] supports lower greenhouse gas emissions, reduced land and water use and preservation of biodiversity.\"Meat lovers, don\\'t worry. While the planetary health diet does limit animal-sourced meats, it doesn\\'t completely eliminate them. The diet allows for about 98 grams of red meat, 203 grams of poultry and 196 grams of fish per week.Planetary health diet benefits for the bodyIn addition to the positive impacts on the planet, those following the planetary health diet may also reap benefits for their overall health.\\xa0\"Like other plant-forward patterns (i.e., Mediterranean diet or DASH), the [planetary health] diet is associated with a reduced risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes and certain cancers, due to its focus on whole, plant-based foods and healthy fats,\" Petitpain told CNET.Plant-based diets have also been linked to the following:Lower risks of strokesBetter weight managementIncreased mental well-beingHealthier digestive tractLower blood pressureReduced inflammationIncreased kidney healthBoosted immune systemHow does the planetary health diet work? Here\\'s an example of what a day on the planetary health diet looks like.\\xa0 EAT-Lancet CommissionThe planetary health diet is plant-forward but not necessarily vegetarian or vegan. It allows for moderate amounts of meat, fish and dairy products, but half your plate should be fruits, non-starchy vegetables, nuts and legumes. The diet also recommends a daily calorie intake of 2,500 to avoid overeating.\\xa0According to EAT\\'s website, \"This amount will vary based on age, gender, activity levels and health profiles. Overconsumption is a waste of food with both health and environmental costs.\"According to the EAT-Lancet Commission, here\\'s how to follow the planetary health diet:125 grams of dry beans, lentils, peas and other nuts or legumes per day98 grams of red meat per week203 grams of poultry per week196 grams of fish per weekThe guidelines also call for cooking at home whenever possible, sharing meals and choosing one serving size to avoid overconsumption, wasting less food, purchasing food directly from farmers and eating less processed foods.\\xa0Diets always come with some complaints. \"Some critics argue the diet\\'s strict limits on animal products may not be culturally practical, affordable or nutritionally adequate for everyone,\" said Petitpain. \"Others question the global applicability of its recommendations, citing differences in regional agriculture and nutrient needs. While health and environmental benefits are well-supported, implementation challenges remain.\"Meal ideas AlexPro9500/Getty ImagesBefore heading to the grocery store for the week, let these sample meals spark some ideas.\\xa0BreakfastLemon blueberry baked oatmeal\\xa0Avocado toast with whole-grain bread\\xa0LunchMinestrone soup with fresh seasonal vegetablesTurkey burger, whole wheat bun with sweet potato friesDinnerStuffed pita bread with curry-fried chickpeas and herb yogurt\\xa0Salmon over salad with avocado dressingSnacksHummus and veggies\\xa0Banana, peanut butter and strawberries\\xa0Check out more meal ideas and recipes at EAT\\'s website.\\xa0Is the planetary health diet right for you? Tanja Ivanova/Getty ImagesIf you have already been intrigued by the Mediterranean diet, then the planetary diet might be worth a try. Here\\'s who should try this diet and who should avoid it.\\xa0Petitpain said the planetary health diet \"is suitable for everyone, although some groups may need larger portions of certain food groups or supplementation.\" For most, however, she states that the diet can help improve long-term health issues while also being kind to the planet. She continued, \"It can benefit people at risk for chronic diseases due to its nutrient-dense, high-fiber and plant-forward approach. It is also appropriate for those interested in flexitarian or semi-vegetarian eating patterns.\"No diet is a one-size-fits-all solution. \"Populations with higher nutrient needs, such as young children, pregnant or breastfeeding women, women with heavy menstrual cycles and individuals with certain medical conditions, may need personalized modifications,\" said Petitpain. \"People with limited access to diverse plant foods or those at risk for deficiencies should approach the diet with guidance.\" King agrees and says, \"Some analysis has shown [the planetary diet] could have dietary gaps in five key nutrients: vitamin B12, calcium, iron and zinc. Modifications may be needed to fill these dietary gaps.\"Careful and knowledgeable planning is vital to meeting all your nutrition requirements, so it\\'s suggested to seek a registered dietitian or nutritionist. Petitpain also recommends \"gradually increasing plant-based meals while reducing red meat and processed foods\" and shooting for \"balance rather than perfection.\"\\xa0\"Focus on variety to ensure adequate protein, iron, omega-3s and other nutrients, possibly with fortified foods or supplements as needed. Always consider personal health needs and consult with a registered dietitian for tailored guidance,\" she continued.Planetary health diet FAQs How much meat can you eat on the planetary diet? On the planetary health diet, half of your diet should be plant-based. However, you can eat about 98 grams of red meat and 203 grams of poultry per week. You can also eat 196 grams of fish. What are the guidelines for the planetary health diet? The guidelines for the planetary health diet include eating mostly plant-based foods. In addition to 125 grams of dry beans, lentils, peas and other nuts or legumes per day, 98 grams of red meat per week, 203 grams of poultry per week and 196 grams of fish per week, the diet also allows for whole grains and moderate amounts of dairy, added sugars, unsaturated plant oils and starchy vegetables.\\xa0 Who invented the planetary health diet? The planetary health diet was invented by the non-profit EAT-Lancet Commission. The organization aims to feed the projected population of 10 billion people by 2050 while also ensuring we have a happy and healthy planet to live on. Are there similar diets to the planetary diet? The planetary diet is similar to the Mediterranean diet. \"Both diets are rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts and healthy fats like olive oil, with moderate fish and minimal red meat intake. They both limit solid fats, added sugar and processed foods. The planetary health diet is framed around global environmental limits, whereas the Mediterranean diet is more rooted in cultural traditions,\" said Petitpain.\\n```\\n\\n## [Best Vitamins and Supplements for Healthy Eyes This Summer](https://www.cnet.com/health/personal-care/best-vitamins-and-supplements-for-healthy-eyes-this-summer/#ftag=CADf328eec) (#102557)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 15:04:59+00:00\\n\\n```\\nThe sun-filled months can do wonders for your mental health. However, the increase in allergens, such as pollen and harmful UV rays can put your eyes at risk. In addition to paying attention to allergies and wearing sunglasses, vitamins and supplements are another way to protect your eyes this late spring and early summer.\\xa0Having a balanced diet is important for more than just your nutrition and gut health. Everything you eat can impact specific organs, like your eyes. Fortunately, that means you can incorporate specific vitamins, supplements and foods into your diet to support your eye health and vision.\\xa0Whether you simply want more eye-boosting vitamins and supplements into your diet or have dietary limitations or nutrient deficiencies, talk to your doctor before making any changes. They can help you figure out what a balanced diet looks like for you, especially if you want to focus on a specific aspect of your health.\\xa0The best vitamins and supplements for eye health Getty ImagesIn addition to a balanced diet, here are the best vitamins and supplements for your eyes. Luckily, you can get most of these added supplements for less than $10.Vitamin A vaaseenaa/Getty ImagesVitamin A supports your vision,\\xa0immune system, heart, lungs and overall growth and development. Specifically, vitamin A helps you see a full spectrum of light, as the vitamin produces pigments in the retina. It can also keep your eyes from drying out. You can find vitamin A in foods such as salmon, broccoli, eggs, carrots and fortified breakfast cereals.You have probably heard of the magic of carrots. Yes, it\\'s true: Carrots are great for your eyes. Carrots (and other vividly colored fruits and vegetables) are high in beta-carotene, which is a compound that your body uses to make vitamin A. Beta-carotene is also available in a supplement form, although it isn\\'t as common as vitamin A and is often more expensive.Vitamin C Vitamin C is found in foods like citrus fruit, bell peppers and tomatoes. Getty ImagesVitamin C is like sunscreen for your eyes: It helps protect them from UV damage. The more time you spend outside and under the sun, the greater the risk for damage. According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, too long in the sun can cause irreversible damage. Vitamin C can also lower your risk of cataracts, a disease that causes the lens of your eyes to become cloudy.While a recent study found that vitamin C supplementation was effective in patients who were already vitamin C deficient, more studies are needed to truly understand the relationship between vitamin C and a lower risk of cataracts. In addition to getting enough vitamin C, avoid tanning beds, and if you are outside, wear sunglasses and a hat to protect your eyes.Omega-3s Fcafotodigital/Getty ImagesOptometrists regularly recommend their patients consume\\xa0omega-3s, and if a patient isn\\'t getting enough of these fatty acids in their diet, try a supplement. Omega-3s are mainly found in fatty fish such as tuna, salmon, mackerel or herring and some nuts and seeds.The American Optometric Association points to omega-3s as a nutrient that can slow the progress of age-related macular degeneration. Studies have also found that they can help prevent dry eye disease. These nutrients are great for both conditions due to their anti-inflammatory effects.Vitamin E yulka3ice/iStock/Getty ImagesAnother powerful antioxidant, vitamin E is vital to all our cells and cell functions. It helps to protect our bodies from cancer-causing free radicals and plays an important role in vision.\\xa0Studies have shown that vitamin E can help protect the retinas from free radicals that can cause eye disease.Vitamin C, another antioxidant, has more properties that help regeneration. Vitamin E can only help to protect the cells already there. But vitamin E can slow the progression of age-related macular degeneration. The American Optometric Association recommends 400 IU of vitamin E a day.ZincZinc is found in almost all multivitamins\\xa0because it is such an essential nutrient to the body. It is used to boost the immune system and help the body heal from wounds quickly. Zinc also aids in eye health.Zinc helps vitamin A create melanin (a pigment that protects the eyes) and may shield the eyes from age-related macular degeneration. The American Optometric Association recommends 40 to 80 mg a day to slow the progression.Read more: Best Zinc SupplementsLutein and zeaxanthinLutein and zeaxanthin are known to be important to our eyes. Lutein and zeaxanthin are carotenoids found in red and yellowish fruits and vegetables, as these compounds give the produce their vibrant colors. Carotenoids, also powerful antioxidants, are vital to eye health. They protect the eyes from free radicals that can cause damage. Lutein and zeaxanthin, specifically, have been found to prevent damage to retinas.These carotenoids can also slow the progression of age-related macular degeneration. The American Optometric Association recommends a daily amount of 10 mg of lutein and 2 mg of zeaxanthin. While you can find lutein and zeaxanthin in supplement form, one bottle is on the pricier side. You may find it better, easier and more affordable to just eat more fruits and vegetables.Vitamins and supplements found in foods Vitamin/supplementFoods Vitamin A Salmon, broccoli, eggs, carrots and fortified breakfast cerealsVitamin C Kale, broccoli, oranges, lemons, strawberries and Brussels sproutsOmega-3s Tuna, salmon, herring, mackerel, chia seeds, flaxseed and walnutsVitamin E Sunflower seeds, almonds, peanuts, collared greens, red bell peppers, mangoes and avocadosZinc Meat, shellfish, chickpeas, lentils, pumpkin seeds, cashews, almonds, eggs, cheese and milkLutein and zeaxanthin Kale, spinach, peas, broccoli, orange juice, red peppers, honeydew melons and grapes What to consider Most vitamins and supplements are generally considered safe for people to take, as they\\'re nutrients your body naturally requires. You should always talk to your doctor before starting any supplements. Some vitamins and supplements can interact with various medications. Check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking any new vitamins or supplements in conjunction with certain medications. Especially if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, consult a medical provider first. Your doctor should be able to safely guide you to the best vitamins and supplements for eye health, as well as proper dosages.Eye health tipsIn addition to the best vitamins and supplements for eye health, there are other ways you can protect your eyes and preserve your vision health:Wear sunglasses:\\xa0Sunglasses block harmful UV light, decreasing your risk of cataracts, eye cancer and sunburn.Screen breaks: The American Optometric Association recommends the 20-20-20 rule, which states that every 20 minutes, you look away from your screen at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.Physical activity: The American Academy of Ophthalmology reported on a study that found a correlation between exercise and eye damage prevention, though more studies are needed.Avoid smoking: Smoking cigarettes can lead to eye diseases that result in vision loss and blindness, according to the Food and Drug Administration.Get regular eye exams: Even if you have perfect vision, it is important to regularly get an eye exam to catch potential issues early. How often you should get an eye exam depends on your age. For instance, people ages 20 to 39 should get an eye exam every five years, while those ages 65 and up should get an eye exam every one to two years.Remove your makeup: Before bed, always remove your makeup to prevent eye irritation and inflammation.Best vitamins for eye health FAQs What is the best vitamin for the eyes? Vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, omega-3s, zinc, lutein and zeaxanthin are all important vitamins for the eyes. If you\\'re curious which vitamins you need more of, consult your doctor. What vitamin is lacking for your eyes? This can vary from person to person, but the best way to find out what vitamin is lacking for your eyes is to consult your doctor. Your doctor can schedule tests to help determine whether you are lacking a certain vitamin that could be beneficial for your eye health. Does vitamin B12 improve eyesight? According to Eye MD Monterey, vitamins B12 and B6 can improve eye health, support the optic nerve, reduce your chances of having blind spots and reduce the chances of having age-related macular degeneration, which causes blurred vision. Do vitamins for the eyes really work? Vitamins for your eyes are especially helpful when you are deficient in any essential vitamins for vision. These include vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, omega-3s, zinc and lutein and zeaxanthin. Studies have found that these vitamins and nutrients can help protect your eyes and even slow the process of age-related eye diseases. While these supplements are not a cure, they support eye health. What supplements can I take to improve my eyesight? You can take vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, omega-3s, zinc and lutein and zeaxanthin. While all are available in supplement form at various prices, you can naturally obtain these vitamins and nutrients in a balanced diet.\\n```\\n\\n## [Supplement health risks to know about, plus a celebrity\\'s \\'brutal\\' infection](https://www.foxnews.com/health/supplement-health-risks-know-about-celebrity-brutal-infection) (#104736)\\n\\n> 2025-06-05 01:18:29+00:00\\n\\n```\\nNEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!\\nFox News\\' Health newsletter brings you stories on the latest developments in healthcare, wellness, diseases, mental health and more.TOP 3:- Common supplements and medications could cause liver damage- Doctors discuss Miley Cyrus\\' ‘brutal’ infection- Smoking and eating cannabis both linked to health risks This week\\'s top health news included the potential link between supplements and liver damage, potential causes of a celebrity\\'s infection, and the risks of cannabis in various forms.

The 25 year old attacker is set for a move during the summer transfer window following an exceptional season that has made him one of Europe\\'s most sought after forwards.Mbeumo has had an impressive run this season, scoring 20 goals and providing eight assists in 38 Premier League games for Brentford, establishing himself as one of the league\\'s standout performers. He has been linked with Newcastle, Liverpool and Tottenham, but it appears Manchester United are the front runners to sign the £50million-rated forward.\\u200cThe Brentford star is eager to experience European football, a factor that could potentially disadvantage United, after a disappointing domestic campaign. Mbeumo has spent six years at Brentford, having signed from French club Troyes when they were in the Championship.\\u200cHis performances for Brentford have previously attracted attention, not just from rival clubs. In the summer of 2022, legendary former Barcelona and Inter Milan striker Samuel Eto\\'o was monitoring him in his capacity as president of the Cameroon Football Federation.Although born in France and having represented Les Bleus at under-17 to under-21 level, Mbeumo never received a senior call-up. His father hails from Cameroon, and ahead of the 2022 World Cup, Eto\\'o approached Mbeumo with a proposal.Mbeumo recollected the encounter on Brentford\\'s club website in November 2022, saying, \"It was just the two of us, I met him in a restaurant. He came to London to see me. I know from my dad, who\\'s Cameroonian, that it could be a good opportunity.\"Article continues below\"When he approached me in the first place, I didn\\'t know if I would go or not. But after speaking to him, he explained to me about the project and I was happy with it. Afterwards, he gave me a bit of time to think about it before I gave my decision, and then I decided to play for them.\"On meeting a football icon, he admitted, \"I was a bit nervous to meet him! He\\'s a legend of African football and football in general. I also asked him questions about being a striker, how he did certain things, how he dealt with certain situations, and he gave me advice. Talking about football with him was great.\"I was a bit nervous to meet him! He\\'s a legend of African football and football in general. I also asked him questions about being a striker, how he did certain things, how he dealt with certain situations, and he gave me advice. Talking about football with him was great.\\u200c\"I\\'m very proud for me and my family to represent the country. My dad was very happy – I also did this for him. I knew how proud he would be and he felt amazing after I made my debut and played those two games.\"Bryan Mbeumo is closing in on a move to Manchester United(Image: Bradley Collyer/PA Wire)With 22 caps and six goals for Cameroon to his name, Mbeumo is aiming to progress in his club career this summer. Despite Brentford’s desire to keep him, manager Thomas Frank recognises his star player\\'s potential to climb higher – even considering clubs like United, who finished five places below in the recent season.\\u200c\"He\\'s been fantastic,\" Frank said in a recent Sky Sports interview. \"For me, it\\'s been a privilege to work with him for six years and see his development from a teenager, I think he was 19 when he came or a young man, to a more grown-up man in many ways. And that personal development I think is equally as important.\"I always knew he was a goalscorer. Now he\\'s now just a more consistent goalscorer. His hold-up play is even better, his assist play or link-up play, his work ethic is fantastic. So very impressed.\"---\\u200cHere at The Manchester Evening News, we are dedicated to bringing you the best Manchester United coverage and analysis.Make sure you don\\'t miss out on the latest United news by joining our free WhatsApp group.

Ruben Amorim\\'s side missed out on European qualification after their defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in last month\\'s Europa League.\\u200cAfter the defeat in Bilbao, the Manchester Evening News reported that Garnacho had been informed that he is allowed to leave United this summer, provided the club receives a suitable offer. Napoli and Chelsea have previously been linked with a move for the Argentina international.\\u200cA fresh report from Spanish news outlet AS has claimed that Aston Villa have now joined the race to sign Garnacho. Bayer Leverkusen, who have former United boss Erik ten Hag as their new manager, have also expressed an interest in Garnacho, according to the report.Garnacho\\'s market value has dramatically increased since he enjoyed his breakthrough season at United in 2022/23. Transfermarkt states that Garnacho\\'s value currently stands at €45million (£37.9million).This is an increase from the start of the 2022/23 season, where Garnacho\\'s value was at €4million (£3.4million). However, Garnacho\\'s value did reach a high of €50million (£42million) last October before decreasing to it\\'s current figure back in March.Article continues below\"Up until the final I played every round helping the team and today I play 20 minutes, I don\\'t know,\" Garnacho said when asked about his future following the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur.\"The final will influence [my decision] but the whole season, the situation of the club.\"I\\'m going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens afterwards.\"\\u200cHere at the Manchester Evening News, we’re dedicated to bringing you the best Manchester United coverage and analysis.Make sure you don’t miss out on the latest United news by joining our free WhatsApp group.

The law makes it a felony to abandon pets during a declared disaster or evacuation, carrying penalties of up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. It also classifies failing to provide confined animals with food, water or exercise, and abandoning an animal as first-degree misdemeanors.Bryant Almeida, of Orange County Animal Services, expressed the significance of the law.[VIDEO BELOW: Dog left tied to pole as hurricane rips through Florida]“It’s terrible that people would even consider doing this to an animal that’s helpless already and now you’re just basically leaving it behind during one of the more dangerous times that we have here in the state,” he said. “So we’re very happy. We’re very excited, and we’re hoping that people take it a little bit more seriously.”Almeida stressed the importance of having an emergency plan for pets, likening their care to that of family members. “People don’t realize that your animals are going to be safe if you leave them by themselves. It can’t take care of itself. It can’t call out for emergency services. It’s stuck wherever you leave it. So, we have to remind people that these are living creatures,” he explained. “If you have a bag for yourself or for your children, for your family members, you should have something similar for your dog.”For those who need to evacuate, Orange County residents can access pet-friendly shelters, typically managed by Animal Services staff. “We actually have entire rooms set up with crates, kennels for cats, dogs, birds, whatever pet you have,” he said.Animals in the pet-friendly shelters are kept in a separate room monitored by staff. However, the pet owner is still responsible for taking care of their pet while they are in the shelter. Owners need to bring their own food, toys, medication the pet may need, and the pet’s updated vaccination record.The county will announce shelter openings on social media and county websites once a hurricane is confirmed.In addition, Orange County Animal Services will host a “Hurricane Expo” on June 21, providing “go bags” for pet owners to keep on hand for emergencies. “We’re going to be giving away bags for people to have during hurricane season in case they have to evacuate. It tells you a list of things that you should have in that bag, for instance, like vaccination records, rabies tags, extra -- or at least a little bit of food -- a little bit of, medication (and a) small first aid kit,” Almeida said.For more details on the event, call the shelter at 407-836-3111.

The rising cost and shrinking availability of property insurance are starting to impact home values and slow sales, even in areas once seen as stable. It\\'s not location or demand driving this shift, but the increasing risks posed by natural disasters.\\nAccording to the newly released 2025 Hurricane Risk Report by Cotality, the financial and social consequences of intensifying hurricane activity are mounting -- particularly in parts of the country less prepared to withstand extreme weather events.\\nCotality\\'s nationwide analysis revealed that more than 33.1 million residential properties -- stretching from Texas to Maine -- are at moderate or greater risk of hurricane wind damage. The combined reconstruction cost value (RCV) of these homes exceeds $11.7 trillion.\\nThe report also highlights storm surge flooding, identifying over 6.4 million homes at risk, with a combined RCV of $2.2 trillion.\\n\"Our data shows that the coastline is evolving, with the impacts of hurricanes extending not only further -- both in cost and distance -- but also on a more consistent basis,\" said Maiclaire Bolton-Smith, vice president of insurance product marketing at Cotality. \"This is being reflected in insurance pricing, which in some cases can actually price people out of what had previously been thought of as less-risky markets.\"\\nThe report underscores that even areas outside of historically high-risk zones are feeling the pressure. While an average of two hurricanes make U.S. landfall each year, their impact is increasingly reflected in local real estate markets. In cities like Charleston, S.C., Wilmington, N.C., and Virginia Beach, VA -- where more than 656,000 homes face storm surge flooding risk -- homes are lingering longer on the market.\\nCotality data shows that homes in Virginia Beach remained on the market 32% longer in 2025 compared to early 2024. Wilmington experienced a similar slowdown, with homes listed 19% longer during the same period.\\n\"While the challenges facing coastal real estate markets are serious, they are not insurmountable. Insurance premiums, lending decisions, property values, and real estate trends are all influenced by risk, but that also means they can be managed with the right information,\" Bolton-Smith continued. \"Insurability remains a challenge, but as technology continues to advance modeling capabilities, there is reason to be optimistic.\"\\nThe findings suggest a pressing need for policymakers, insurers, and real estate professionals to adapt to shifting risk landscapes -- and for homeowners to better understand how climate-related insurance factors may shape the future of housing on the coast.\\nRelated News Stories\\n```\\n\\n## [Time to prepare: Hurricane season has officially started](https://naturaldisasters.einnews.com/article/819226767/CCbd473tFCqzYoKU?ref=rss&ecode=5DCHg6ojdayQpKlr) (#105134)\\n\\n> 2025-06-05 05:21:56+00:00\\n\\n```\\nTYLER, Texas (KLTV) - Hurricane season has officially started. Even if you’re not on the coast, heavy rain and storms can still impact your area.“Now is the time to prepare,” says Andrew Tate, First Alert Meteorologist.Tate says areas closer to the Gulf Coast are at higher risk for hurricanes, but even inland areas can be severely affected.“You can see those impacts further inland and sometimes that all has to do with the track of a system, and if you’re on ‘the dirty side’, which is usually that eastern side of the storm,” says TateHurricane Beryl from 2024 showed how unpredictable the season can be, rapidly intensifying and impacting East Texas.“Just because we saw Beryl in East Texas last summer doesn’t mean that we’re exempt this year,” says Tate. “But at the same time, that doesn’t mean that we will see something like Beryl, it is just each year it’s an independent variable on whether or not you would see a strong system.”Ryan Knapp from National Weather Service forecast office in Shreveport spoke on East Texas Now regarding some of the main concerns during hurricane season, especially those living inland.NWS meteorologist Ryan Knapp gives insight into upcoming Atlantic hurricane season“If you do live farther inland, you can still see tornadoes, you can see damaging winds, you can see flooding rainfall and just understand that that risk still exists for landfalling storms, especially if they’re stronger when they make landfall,” says Knapp.That’s why Knapp says the key is to prepare early.“You know, just being prepared, having a preparedness kit, you know, like I said, hurricane season started just over the weekend,” says Knapp. “So you know, obviously we haven’t seen anything developed yet, but it’s good to start, really, in the event that we do run into a situation where there’s a storm on the way.”You can stay ahead of hurricane season and any severe weather threat by downloading our weather apps.For more information on how to download the KLTV weather app on your phone, click here.For more information on how to download the KTRE weather app on your phone,\\xa0click here.Copyright 2025 KLTV.

It is also relatively lightweight and offers 5G.In contrast, the iPad Mini is great for those on the go and has a 7.9-inch screen that is ideal for e-book reading or casual browsing. It also has a very high pixel density so even though the screen is small, the quality is great.The iPad Pro boasts either an 11 or 12.9-inch screen and is aimed primarily at creative professionals as it features a great camera and stylus for designing.Of course, there is also the normal iPad (now on its tenth generation) which has come on vastly since the first tablet launch.

By contrast, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 has just a 50MP main camera and a 10MP 3X optical zoom lens.Most people now expect that the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 Ultra (or just Galaxy Z Fold Ultra) will match the S25 Ultra camera specs.But, to my mind, that still doesn\\'t make this new foldable a true Ultra. To do that, it needs to incorporate the S Pen. I\\'m aware that the Galaxy S Ultra line didn\\'t always feature a stylus. This happened when, in a similar fashion to what Samsung is announcing here, the Samsung Galaxy Note line disappeared and core features, like the S Pen, became part of the S21 Ultra line.It\\'s been four years since Samsung made that choice and, as I see it, the S Pen is now integral to the S25 Ultra\\'s identity. It makes the phone far more versatile than flagship competitors like my beloved iPhone 16 Pro Max and many other Android rivals. It\\'s a powerful tool when paired with Galaxy AI features like Sketch to Image, as well as note taking, and one of my favorites, drawing.S Pens are not foreign to the Galaxy Z Fold line. You can buy a one or a special case that incorporates one. It isn\\'t the same S Pen that slips into the S25 Ultra. You would damage the Z Fold\\'s flexible screen if you used the traditional S Pen on it. There has never been, though, an S Pen incorporated into the Z Fold body.Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra\\'s Pen. Let\\'s make it thinner and slip it into the Z Fold Ultra. (Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)There are likely good reasons for this. Chief among them is the current Z Fold 6\\'s incredible svelte frame. Unfolded, the Z Fold 6 is 5.6mm thick. That\\'s 0.2mm thinner than the new Galaxy S25 Edge and a few millimeters thinner than the S25 Ultra.Still, if Samsung insists on calling this new phone an Ultra, simple \"S Pen support\" won\\'t be enough. I want to see it innovate and make a special S Pen thin enough to slide inside one side of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 Ultra. It seems almost possible – after all, Samsung already removed Bluetooth support from the current S Pens. That likely means fewer components and more space, or at least the option to slim down a little bit.It\\'s not that I can\\'t live with a decent S Pen Z Fold case but, considering what we\\'re paying for the fold, and the Z Fold Ultra is unlikely to be any cheaper, why should I pay another $100 or $150 for a case and accessory? Also, the convenience of having the S Pen just a press away – it pops out of the Z Fold Ultra body – is so alluring.So, that\\'s my pitch. I\\'m all for a little strategic rebranding but, if you want me to get excited about it, it should bring some reinvention, too. A Samsung Galaxy Z Fold Ultra with an integrated S Pen would be the absolute bomb.You might also likeA flood of Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7 leaks have arrivedHold the phone!

Once upon a time, Surface products were pitched as flagship devices that were showcases for the latest and greatest Windows features, while also allowing Microsoft to directly compete with its arch nemesis Apple and its MacBook and iPad devices.Surface devices were also often quite innovative, with unusual form factors that would again be used to showcase various Windows features, and they were championed by Panos Paney, an enthusiastic spokesperson for Surface devices. This meant that despite Surface devices never gaining the kind of mainstream success that Apple’s devices enjoyed, it was always interesting to see what new products the Surface team were working on.But times change. Panay left for Amazon, and a lot of the enthusiasm and excitement about Surface devices seemed to leave Microsoft with him. The company simplified the Surface lineup, dropping some of the more experimental models, and focused more on commercial customers. The Surface Pro 12 (2025) is seemingly out to prove that Microsoft hasn’t abandoned its consumers, nor has it forgotten about its Surface lineup – I just worry if it’s a case of too little, too late.(Image credit: Future)The trimming down of the Surface product line means there’s going to be no more Surface Go devices (I asked Microsoft about this directly), which were affordable versions of the usual premium Surface devices. While I appreciated the aim of Surface Go devices – it’s always nice to see a company make more affordable versions of its expensive devices – they never quite hit the mark in my view, with a few too many compromises being made to lower the price at the expense of performance.Thankfully, that doesn’t mean that people on a budget won’t be able to afford a Surface device, as the base model of the new Surface Pro 12-inch (2025) is now considered the entry level model. Starting at $799.99 / £799 / AU$1,499, it is now the cheapest Surface Pro model, and is a fair bit less expensive than last year’s Surface Pro 11, which started at $999.99 /£1,049.99 / AU$1,899.99.It’s also a lot less expensive than its biggest competitor, the iPad Pro 13-inch (2024), which launched at a rather staggering $1,299 / £1,299 / $2,199.While at first glance this seems like a great deal – a newer model for a lot less than the previous model – there are a number of differences between the Surface Pro 12 and Surface Pro 11 that show that Microsoft has still made certain sacrifices to lower the price of the new model. I certainly wouldn’t think of it as an upgrade, rather a more affordable alternative to last year’s model. That’s not a bad thing, of course, but it’s worth pointing out so you know what you’re getting if you buy the new Surface Pro 12 (2025).Let’s start with the screen: rather confusingly, the number in the Surface Pro 11’s name refers to the fact that it is the 11th edition of the Surface Pro.Meanwhile, the Surface Pro 12 is named after its screen-size. So, the Surface Pro 11 actually has a larger screen – and a higher resolution as well.The Surface Pro 12 comes with a 12-inch screen with a 2196 x 1464 resolution and refresh rate of up to 90Hz. The Surface Pro 11, meanwhile, comes with a 13-inch screen with a 2880 x 1920 resolution and up to 120Hz refresh rate. It can also be configured to come with an OLED panel.Other changes are that the Surface Pro 12 comes with just one memory configuration: 16GB, whereas last year’s model can be configured up to 32GB. The Surface Pro 12 comes with a single processor choice – the Arm-based, eight-core Snapdragon X Plus, a more affordable, yet less powerful, version of the 10-core X Plus that comes in the Surface Pro 11. That model can also be configured with the even more powerful 12-core Snapdragon X Elite chip.The Surface Pro 12 also drops support for 5G data connections (though it still features cutting-edge Wi-Fi 7 technology), and the two USB-C ports in this model are USB 3.2, rather than the faster USB4 connections in last year\\'s model.These are quite substantial differences, and while some people might consider them a downgrade compared to the Surface Pro 11, it’s important to note that Microsoft continues to sell that model alongside the Surface Pro 12, so if you’re looking for a flagship experience, you’ll want the (slightly) older model. This could, of course, confuse people who assume the latest model is also the most powerful, or that the only difference between them are the screen sizes. But, you know: Microsoft and confusing product names – name a more iconic duo.As with previous Surface Pro devices, the Surface Pro 12 is a Windows 11 tablet, and Microsoft is one of the few companies continuing to release them. The dominance of iPads running iPadOS and Android tablets has seemingly turned off many manufacturers from making Windows tablets.In a way that’s a shame, as while Windows 11 isn’t an operating system primarily designed for touchscreen devices, unlike iPadOS or Android, the touchscreen experience has come a long way, and you can comfortably find your way around Windows 11 and run most tasks and actions via the touchscreen thanks to large, easy-to-hit, icons and buttons. However, there are still times when Windows 11’s origins as an operating system designed for desktop PCs are apparent, such as when a menu or dialogue box appears that feels clumsy when prodded by a finger and requires a mouse and keyboard for the best experience.(Image credit: Future)On the other hand, by running Windows 11, you can install full desktop versions of applications, such as Microsoft Word or Adobe Photoshop, rather than the more limited tablet apps. This is the one area I feel Microsoft has the advantage over Apple’s iPad Pro, which, despite featuring the powerful M4 chip found in the best MacBooks and Macs, still uses iPadOS, which means it’s limited to the same basic apps that the iPad mini and iPad Air can run. This makes it feel like a lot of that power is wasted, and it’s something that the Surface Pro 12 avoids by being able to run almost any full desktop program. Plus, the Surface Pro 12 (2025) is nowhere near as powerful, or as expensive, as the iPad Pro, meaning you won’t be quite as concerned about paying for performance you’re not using.I say ‘almost’ every Windows 11 app because it’s important to note that the Surface Pro 12 uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus chip, which is based on Arm architecture. Without getting too caught up in the weeds of tech mumbo-jumbo, in the past most consumer laptops and PCs used x86-based chips, primarily from Intel and AMD, and that meant that the majority of Windows applications were coded for x86 hardware, so Windows devices using Arm hardware couldn’t run them – instead you had to hope that the app makers would take the time to make an Arm-compatible version, and because sales of Windows on Arm hardware was so small compared to x86, very few developers thought it was worth doing.Thankfully that’s changed a lot, mainly because the recent generation of Windows 11 laptops using Arm hardware (specifically the Snapdragon X), pushed by Microsoft’s Copilot+ PC branding, have been very popular (and deservedly so, just check out our Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 review and Dell XPS 13 (2024) review for two recent examples of why Snapdragon X laptops are so good).Microsoft has also released its Prism tool, which is essentially an emulator that allows x86 apps to run on Arm hardware with minimal impact to performance. This, combined with a growing library of native Arm apps for Windows 11 means that most of your favorite apps will run on the Surface Pro 12 – though there might still be cases where an app you often use can’t run.The Surface Pro 12 (2025) can also be fitted with the Surface Pro 12-inch Keyboard, which offers a tactile, comfortable-to-use, full-size keyboard and trackpad, while also doubling as a protective cover for the screen. This turns the Surface Pro 12 into a 2-in-1 device that can be used as both a tablet and a keyboard, and for pretty much any task where you need to write reams of text, it’s an essential add-on.Sadly, you have to buy it separately, which adds a further $149.99 / £149.99 / AU$274.95 – a not insubstantial extra expense that I feel most people will need to pay for to get the most out of the Surface Pro 12.The Surface Pro 12-inch Keyboard snaps on easily thanks to a proprietary magnetic connection, but because of the new screen size, it means you can’t use keyboards from older Surface devices. You can, at least, use a standard Bluetooth or wired keyboard, but that means you miss out on the portability.Surface Pro 12 (2025): Price and availability(Image credit: Future)How much does it cost? Starts at of $799.99 / £799 / AU$1,499When is it available? On sale nowWhere can you get it? You can get it in the US, UK, and AustraliaWith the affordable Surface Go lineup seemingly chucked in the trash, the Surface Pro 12 (2025) is now the most affordable way to get a new Surface Pro, with a starting price of $799.99 / £799 / AU$1,499, which is a fair bit cheaper than 2024’s Surface Pro 11 which starts at $999.99 /£1,049.99 / AU$1,899.99. Microsoft is continuing to sell the Surface Pro 11 alongside the Surface Pro 12, pitching the older model as the premium, flagship device, while the Surface Pro 12 takes the place of the Surface Go as the entry-level.For that starting price, you get a Snapdragon X Plus 8-core CPU, 16GB RAM, and 256GB of storage. You can also configure it to come with 512GB of SSD storage for an extra $100 / £100 / AU$200. Apart from that, you’re unable to configure any other aspect of the hardware, though you can choose different colors (more of that in a moment).The starting price is certainly competitive, especially considering the iPad Pro 13-inch starts at $1,299 / £1,299 / $2,199. Meanwhile, the latest iPad Air 13-inch starts at a similar $799 / £799 / AU$1,299 price, but comes with less storage and memory, and lacks Wi-Fi 7 support.As a reasonably powerful tablet, then, the price is very good, though there are budget Android tablets out there for a lot less.What’s not included in the price is a wall charger. The Surface Pro 12 no longer uses the proprietary Surface Connect port to charge – instead, any USB-C charger will work, so the lack of an included charger probably won’t be a huge deal for a lot of people, and at least helps keep the price down and reduce waste. If you need a charger, then you can buy an official one for $69.99 / £49.99 / AU$89.95, but because any USB-C power supply above 27W will work, there are plenty of cheaper options.However, to get the most out of the Surface Pro 12 (and Windows 11, the operating system it runs), you’ll need the Surface Pro 12-inch Keyboard, which turns it into a 2-in-1 device that can be used as either a tablet or a laptop.The Surface Pro 12-inch Keyboard is sold separately and will set you back $149.99 / £149.99 / AU$274.95, so unless you just want to use the Surface Pro 12 as a tablet, you should factor that into the price.You can also get the 12-inch Keyboard with the Slim Pen stylus in a bundle for $249.99 / £249.99 / $454.95.In the US and Australia, you can also buy the Surface Slim Pen on its own for $129.99 / AU$229.5. While the stylus is less essential to the overall experience, this does show that from the reasonable starting price, the Surface Pro 12 can quickly jump in cost when you start configuring it.Value: 4 / 5Microsoft Surface Pro 12: SpecsSwipe to scroll horizontallyHeader Cell - Column 0 Microsoft Surface Pro 12 (base model)Microsoft Surface Pro 12 (highest specs)Microsoft Surface Pro 11Price$799.99 / £799 / AU$1,499$899.99 / £899.99 / AU$1,699Starting at $999.99 /£1,049.99 / AU$1,899.99CPU8-core Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus8-core Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus10-core Qualcomm Snapdragon X PlusGPUQualcomm AdrenoQualcomm AdrenoQualcomm AdrenoNPUQualcomm Hexagon (45 TOPS)Qualcomm Hexagon (45 TOPS)Qualcomm Hexagon (45 TOPS)RAM16GB16GB16GBStorage256GB512GB256GB, 512GBDisplay12 inches LCD (2196 x 1464)12 inches LCD (2196 x 1464)13 inches LCD (2880 x 1920)Ports2x USB-C (3.2)2x USB-C (3.2)2x Thunderbolt 4ConnectivityWi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4Size10.8 x 7.47 x 0.30 ins | 274 x 190 x 7.8mm10.8 x 7.47 x 0.30 ins | 274 x 190 x 7.8mm11.3 x 8.2 x 0.37 ins | 287 x 209 x 9.3mmWeight1.5 lbs | 686g1.5 lbs | 686g1.97 lbs | 895gMicrosoft Surface Pro 12 (2025): Design(Image credit: Future)New screen sizeThinnest Copilot+ PCNew color optionsIf you’ve ever seen a Surface Pro device in the wild, then you’ll pretty much know what to expect with the Surface Pro 12 (2025). On its own it looks like a pretty standard tablet, though I have to say that the thick bezels around the screen does make it feel a little outdated compared to some of its rivals (and even the older Surface Pro 11 has thinner bezels on two of the sides of the screen).As with previous models, the back has an embossed Windows logo, and the bottom half can be pulled out to make a kick stand, a nice feature that the likes of the iPad don’t have. In the center of the bottom side, there’s also a magnetic port that you use to affix the Surface Pro 12-inch Keyboard to – though if you have an existing Surface Keyboard or Type Cover it won’t work due to the new size.There are some subtle – and mostly welcome – changes introduced to the design of the Surface Pro 12, however. The proprietary Surface Connect port has been ditched – thankfully – and instead you charge the Surface Pro 12 (2025) via one of the two USB-C ports. While this change has been mainly introduced to comply with a European Union (EU) directive that states that all new electronic devices sold in the EU must support USB-C charging, it’s a positive one for consumers I feel, and does mean that for many of us that already have plenty of USB-C chargers we’re not getting yet another charger that will just be wasted.(Image credit: Future)Because of the new, smaller, screen, the Surface Pro 12 feels more comfortable to hold in the hand than the larger 13-inch Surface Pro from 2024 (I have both). The Surface Pro 12’s dimensions of 10.8 x 7.47 x 0.30 inches (274mm x 190mm x 7.8mm) are noticeably more compact than the Surface Pro 11’s dimensions of 11.3 x 8.2 x 0.37 inches (287mm x 208.6mm x 9.3mm), and the weight difference (1.5 pounds (686g) for the Surface Pro 12 vs 1.97 pounds (0.89kg) for the Pro 11) means if portability is a priority for you (and if you’re planning on using it as a tablet, then it should be), the Surface Pro 12 could, on paper, be the device to get.However, it’s not just the screensize that’s different, and you should be aware of some of the changes Microsoft has made to keep the price of the Surface Pro 12 down.For a start, there’s no OLED model, and the refresh rate is capped at 90Hz (rather than 120Hz of the Surface Pro 11).The Surface Pro 12 also has a lower resolution of 2196 x 1464 vs 2880 x 1920 of the Pro 11, and that also means a lower pixel density of 220 PPI (pixels per inch) compared to the 267 PPI of the Pro 11. This means the image quality isn’t as sharp on the Pro 12.The Surface Pro 12 also lacks the easily accessed NVMe port of the Surface Pro 11, which was located on the older model behind the kickstand, and was a nice addition that allowed you to quickly upgrade the storage space of the Pro 11.(Image credit: Future)On the back of the Surface Pro 12 is a new indent which is where you magnetically attach the Slim Pen stylus (sold separately). Microsoft sent me one to review along with the Surface Pro 12, and I was impressed with how secure the Slim Pen felt when it was magnetically attached – I certainly didn’t worry that the stylus would drop off the tablet.The Slim Pen also wirelessly charges when attached, which is a nice touch. Despite the indent, however, having the Slim Pen attached does mean that the Surface Pro 12 doesn’t sit flush when placed back-down on a table or desk.(Image credit: Future)Connecting the Surface Pro 12-inch Keyboard (also sold separately, and supplied by Microsoft for this review) is also quick and easy thanks to a magnetic connection. It adds a bit more weight and bulk, but when closed will protect the screen. It also allows you to use the Surface Pro 12 as a laptop-like device, and I think it’s worth getting. You’ll need to use the kickstand to support the Surface Pro 12 when it’s used as a screen, which isn’t the most comfortable if you’re using it on your lap, but it does work. However, you can’t really adjust the angle of the screen, unlike Apple’s Magic Keyboard for the iPad Pro.The Surface Pro 12’s USB-C ports are also limited to USB 3.2, rather than USB4, which is supported by the Surface Pro 11. You’ll still be able to plug in the same peripherals, but data transfer will be slower.(Image credit: Future)A more positive design tweak are the two new color schemes, Violet and Ocean, along with the same Platinum color that previous Surface Pros came in. I’ve seen the new Surface Laptop in Violet, and it looks lovely. However, the base model of the new Surface Pro, which I have, only comes in Platinum – you’ll need to pay extra for more storage if you want the Surface Pro 12 in either Violet or Ocean.Overall, the design of the Surface Pro 12 is solid, though not that excited, especially if you get it in Platinum. Compared to the iPad Air (2025), which has a weight of 460g and dimensions of 247.6mm x 178.5mm x 6.1mm for the 11-inch model, it feels chunkier and cheaper than Apple’s tablet. If you’re used to iPad tablets, you will likely much prefer Appe’s design. The compromises to screen quality and USB speeds with the Surface Pro 12 are also a shame.Design: 3.5 / 5Microsoft Surface Pro 12 (2025): Performance(Image credit: Future)Good for general use16GB RAM helps with multitaskingAI features remain pointlessBenchmarksThese are the results of our benchmarking tests for the Microsoft Surface Pro 12 (2025):3DMark Solar Bay: 5,9213DMark Wildlife Extreme: 3,179Geekbench 6.4 Single-core: 2,263Geekbench 6.4 Multi-core: 9,913Crossmark Overall: 1,103Crossmark Responsiveness: 1,003PugetBench Photoshop: 4,043Battery (TechRadar test): 17 hours, 49 minutesMicrosoft might argue that the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus chip within the Surface Pro 12 is the most exciting component, and I’d agree, but likely not for the same reason.The Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus is an Arm-based chip (similar to the M4 chip in the MacBook), with a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) of 45 Trillion Operations per Second (TOPS) – an essential specification for it to be called a ‘Copilot+ PC’, which is Microsoft’s catch-all term for Windows 11 laptops that come with NPUs that can handle on-device AI tasks.You might have noticed that a lot of companies are shoving AI into their products, and Microsoft is arguably one of the most ambitious. Like it or not, AI tools are now tightly integrated into Windows 11, and there’s no sign of that slowing down, with Microsoft’s Copilot AI tool becoming a fundamental part of the operating system, even getting its own dedicated key on the keyboard.Of course, if you don’t have a Copilot+ PC you can still use Copilot – the key difference is that thanks to the NPU, you can use Copilot and other AI tools locally on the Surface Pro 12 itself, rather than relying on an internet connection and cloud-based AI tools.The benefits are that you can work offline with these tools, and as all the data you provide the AI with is stored locally, there should be no danger of your data being shared with third parties or used to train AI models. This is good if you’re using AI tools with personal and private information, but less so if you’re just messing around with turning scribbles into AI-generated images in Paint.Speaking of which, doing that is OK on the Surface Pro 12. Asking Paint to generate an image based on a photo I loaded took about 20 seconds, and the results were… well, what you’d expect from AI-generated art these days. Fine, and initially impressive, but not much more than a brief diversion, as the ‘art’ it produces comes with familiar tell-tale signs that it’s been made by AI. It’s likely a tool you’ll try once and then forget about it.(Image credit: Future)The Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus’ NPU also gives you access to some exclusive Windows 11 features, namely Click To Do. This feature, which is still in ‘preview’, so not the finished article, is pitched by Microsoft as a way to do things more quickly and easily in Windows 11 with the help of AI.By holding down the Windows key on the keyboard, you’ll see the mouse cursor turn into a white dot. Clicking on something (or tapping using the Surface Pro 12 screen) will give the screen a blue tint to show that Click To Do is enabled. If you only have the Surface Pro 12 and no keyboard, you can also bring this up quickly by swiping from the right-hand side of the screen.Click To Do should then intelligently offer up some quick actions supposedly based on what it sees on your screen, such as opening an image in the Photos app and removing the background.In theory, this could save some time, though to be honest, right-clicking a document and choosing what app to open it in covers a lot of that, is much faster, and doesn’t require a Copilot+ PC.In practice, however, the feature seems pretty useless. I used Click To Do with my Pictures folder open, then clicked on a photo, then selected Remove background with Paint, thinking that this would open the photo in Paint and remove the background. Instead, it opened the thumbnail preview of the image (which is tiny and pixellated) and removed the background.Thinking maybe it was Paint’s fault, I did it again, but this time selected Blur background with Photos. This opened up the Photos app, but again, it was just the thumbnail; it didn’t actually open the file.So what Click To Do is really doing is taking a screenshot of whatever is open, and all you can really do is interact with the screenshot, not the actual files. Maybe I got the wrong end of the stick, but it felt like Click To Do was promising something quite complex, but in reality, it was just basic and of no use.I tried it with a web browser open and some Bing (of course) search results. Click To Do offered to copy text to Notepad. A bit pointless, but I gave it a go, and it pasted a single line of unintelligible nonsense. Sure, Click To Do is supposedly still in ‘preview’, but it’s in no fit state at the moment, and as a key selling point of Copilot+ PCs like the Surface Pro 12, it’s embarrassing.(Image credit: Future)Recall, another feature touted as a key selling point for Copilot+ PCs, is in a similar preview state. I’ve gone over the controversies of this plenty of times before but the general thrust of this feature is that it runs in the background and takes constant screenshots that you can then scroll back through and search for things.Recall was supposed to launch with the initial wave of Copilot+ PCs, but a big backlash amidst privacy and security concerns kept Microsoft from rolling it out. Now it’s here (albeit in preview form), and most of my privacy concerns have been alleviated. First, unusually for Microsoft, you have to turn on this feature yourself; it’s not turned on by default (as it was initially). All the images and data are stored locally, and thanks to the NPU, all AI tasks are done on the Surface Pro 12 itself.Recall, and the data it collects, can also only be accessed by the user when logged in, and needs to have advanced Windows Hello biometric security enabled.While the security aspect seems improved, if not completely perfect, my other big concern about just how useful Recall will prove to be remains. On the Surface Pro 12, it can feel a bit sluggish, and it even crashed once, and the results were mixed. It did find screenshots containing search results I’d asked for reasonably well, but once it brings up the screenshots, you’re a bit limited to what you can do – a lot like Click To Do, you can’t click on a file or folder to open it up, though to be fair it does allow you to open the folder location in Windows Explorer.But it just doesn’t seem that useful, and because you now have to turn it on yourself, and considering the performance and storage impact Recall has when taking all these screenshots, Microsoft needs to really make Recall worth using – and so far it hasn’t.(Image credit: Future)On a (much) more positive note, the general performance of the Surface Pro 12 (2025) is good. Even demanding apps like Photoshop installed and launched without issue, and because you’re able to run Windows 11 applications, it makes the Surface Pro 12 (2025) a much better tool, in my mind, than the iPad Pro, which despite all its power is limited to iPadOS apps, which are more basic.Having multiple desktop apps open at once and switching between them was fine, though if you are going to be mainly using standard Windows 11 apps, you’ll need to invest in the Surface Pro 12-inch Keyboard, frankly, as these apps can be fiddly if you’re just using the touchscreen to control them. I did notice, however, that trying to perform too many tasks at once can make the performance of the Surface Pro 12-inch lag, with the occasional app crash. Nothing too out of the ordinary if you’re used to Windows 11, but it means there’s not the slick experience you might expect from an iPad.Logging into the Surface Pro 12 is handled by the Windows Hello biometric tool, which uses the built-in webcams of the tablet to recognise your face. I found it worked reliably in a range of different lighting conditions, and meant logging in was both quick and secure. If Windows Hello can’t detect you, you can use a PIN or password to log in.The front-facing webcam does a decent job, though at 1080p, it’s not as sharp or detailed as the 1440p webcam on last year’s model. As the Surface Pro 12 is a Copilot+ PC, you can use the Windows Studio effects tool to tweak the webcam’s footage live. Using AI and the NPU of the Snapdragon chip, you can blur the background, or add creative filters that make you look like a cell-shaded animation, watercolor painting, and automatically center yourself in frame.(Image credit: Future)These work fine, but they are nothing we haven’t seen before, and the background blur feature seemed less effective as other background blurring features I’ve tried, such as when using Google Meet, with noticeable gaps in the blur where the clear background could be seen.One feature I did like was Eye Contact, which uses AI to make it seem like you’re looking directly at the screen. As with a lot of devices, the webcam of the Surface Pro 12 is either at the top, bottom or side of the screen, depending on the orientation, and this can result in video calls where it appears like you’re looking away (as you’re usually focusing on the screen). With this feature, it does a good job of adjusting your eyes so they are looking directly at the person you’re talking to.It sounds a bit creepy, but it does make video calls (or just taking selfies) feel more natural, and the feature does a good job of matching your eye color. When I first tried this feature a while ago, it felt fake, with a definite element of ‘uncanny valley’ where you can tell something isn’t quite right, but it seems the feature has been improved a lot.The rear camera is Ultra HD, though the photos I took with it weren’t particularly impressive, with quite a bit of noticeable noise in darker conditions. While taking photos, the Camera app became unresponsive, which means I could not adjust the focus; instead, I had to wait a few seconds. This also means that some photos I thought I had taken hadn’t actually been saved, so I wouldn’t recommend depending on the Surface Pro 12 to take once-in-a-lifetime photos – you’d be much safer sticking to your smartphone.Throughout my time with the Surface Pro 12, I appreciated how silent it was. Like Apple’s M-series chips in modern MacBook Air laptops, the Snapdragon X Plus is efficient enough that the Surface Pro 12 it powers doesn’t need internal fans to keep it cool, so you don’t get any distracting and annoying fan noise when the tablet is working hard. However, with the occasional hangs that I experienced using Windows 11 on the Surface Pro 12, trading silence for a more reliable experience (as cooling the components could improve performance) might have been one compromise I’d have liked.Performance: 3 / 5Microsoft Surface Pro 12: Battery lifeMicrosoft promises 16 hours of local video playbackLower refresh rate of screen helps give battery life a boostAlmost 18 hours in our battery testsA common frustration I have with Copilot+ PC devices running on Arm hardware is that the marketing material often focuses solely on AI features and capabilities, but they are the least interesting thing about products like the Surface Pro 12.Thanks to the power efficiency of the latest Snapdragon X chips, battery lives of these Copilot+ PC devices are impressively long, and considering that battery life is one of the most important considerations people have when buying a new laptop (it is for me, anyway), it\\'s a shame that this aspect is often glossed over.The Surface Pro 12 continues this theme, with a battery that lasted an excellent 17 hours and 49 minutes in my battery life benchmark test, which involved playing a looped HD video until the battery died.While this isn\\'t the longest battery life I\\'ve seen with a Copilot+ PC, it\\'s great that we seem to be in an era where battery lives for Windows 11 devices that are near 20 hours are increasingly common (though even the best gaming laptops won\\'t get anywhere near that). You\\'ll certainly be able to bring it on long international flights to work and watch films on, and have plenty of battery left.Most importantly, it means you can go several work days on a single charge in most cases, since you likely won\\'t be using it for 18 hours straight, making it a great choice for people looking for a thin and light device to work on.(Image credit: Future)Battery Life: 5 / 5Should you buy the Microsoft Surface Pro 12 (2025)?Swipe to scroll horizontallyMicrosoft Surface Pro 12 (2025) report cardHeader Cell - Column 0 RemarksScoreValueThe starting price of the Surface Pro 12 is excellent, though you\\'ll need to pay extra for the keyboard cover.4 / 5DesignA slick, if uninspiring, design that\\'s thin and light.

Apple\\'s titanium-aluminium alloy frame, rumoured since July 2024 and echoed by Jeff Pu in February 2025, aims to avoid a \"Bendgate\" repeat.Yet, a 2,800mAh battery, 20% smaller than the iPhone 16\\'s, raises concerns about longevity, though a silicon-carbon battery could improve efficiency by 15%.On X posts, users like @appltrack praise the 6.6-inch display, but some question if thinness sacrifices durability. Verdict: plausible, but battery trade-offs need scrutiny.Sort Fact from Fiction on ChipsTalk of Apple\\'s in-house C1 modem and Wi-Fi 7 chip, codenamed Proxima, has fuelled speculation about hardware independence.Tom\\'s Guide confirms the C1 modem, first floated by Kuo in July 2024, will debut in the iPhone 17 Air, offering better power efficiency than Qualcomm\\'s.The A19 chip is expected, with the Air using a standard version and Pro models getting a 2nm A19 Pro. X user @ShishirShelke1 hypes 35W fast charging and 12GB RAM.These upgrades could save Apple £80 million ($108 million) annually, but Wi-Fi 7\\'s universal rollout remains unverified.Clear Up Camera and Display ClaimsRumours of a centre-aligned \"camera bar\" on the iPhone 17 Air, housing a single 48MP lens, emerged in December 2024, with dummy units in April 2025 adding credibility, per MacRumors.Yet, @theapplehub on X speculates it might mask dual-camera tech, though no leaker confirms this.A 24MP front camera with a six-element lens is widely backed by Kuo and Pu. All models may get 120Hz ProMotion LTPO OLED displays, a claim from DSCC in April 2023, reiterated by Ice Universe in July 2024.However, The Verge notes Apple might reserve ProMotion for Pro models to differentiate them.The eSIM-only rumour, reported in November 2024, raises concerns for markets like China, where dual SIMs are standard, dummy units show no SIM slot, but Apple\\'s global strategy makes this questionable.Thin Dreams, Real ChallengesOn 04 June 2025, the iPhone 17 Air\\'s buzz is undeniable, but separating hype from reality reveals a delicate balance. The ultra-thin design and custom chips are credible, backed by leakers and dummy units, yet battery life and eSIM-only concerns linger.ProMotion displays seem likely, but the camera bar\\'s single-lens claim needs more proof. With tariffs threatening a £160 ($216) price hike, Apple\\'s 09 September 2025 reveal must deliver innovation that justifies the cost.The much awaited iPhone 17 Air could redefine sleekness, but only if Apple nails the execution.\\n```\\n\\n## [I Find Android Phones Too Complicated, and That\\'s Why I Love Google\\'s Pixel 9 Pro](https://www.cnet.com/deals/i-find-android-phones-too-complicated-and-thats-why-i-love-googles-pixel-9-pro/#ftag=CAD590a51e) (#101963)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 12:00:12+00:00\\n\\n```\\nWhy You Can Trust CNET Our expert deal-hunting staff showcases the best price drops and discounts from reputable sellers daily.

Expertise Smartphones, photography, iOS, Android, gaming, outdoor pursuits. CredentialsShortlisted for British Photography Awards 2022, Commended in Landscape Photographer of the Year 2022 4 min read CNET\\'s key takeawaysI\\'ve been using Google\\'s Pixel 9 Pro for months.I like its solid overall performance and quirky new AI skills.The element that stands out most is how easy it is to use.Android phones often get a bad rap for being overly convoluted. And to be fair, that\\'s often well justified. Samsung\\'s Galaxy S25 range, for example, has deep menu systems for messing about with nearly every aspect of the phone, along with features like the Edge Panel sidebar and a variety of Samsung\\'s own AI tools. You even get Samsung\\'s version of some apps, so you end up with two apps for photos, two apps for web browsing and so on.For many Android users, the deep customizability of the OS has always been a selling point over the more simplistic iOS found on Apple\\'s iPhones. But just because you want an Android phone, doesn\\'t necessarily mean you\\'re a fanatical tech nerd who wants to tinker with menus all day.\\xa0The Pixel 9 Pro is the easiest Android phone I\\'ve ever used, and there\\'s a number of key reasons why.\\xa0 SMARTPHONE DEALS OF THE WEEK $1,100 (save $50) $799 (save $200) $176 (save $24) $300 (save $100) $350 (save $279) Deals are selected by the CNET Group commerce team, and may be unrelated to this article.My experience with the Pixel 9 ProFirst, it\\'s Google\\'s own phone, meaning there\\'s no secondary manufacturer software skin over the top of the operating system. It\\'s pure, uncut Android. Google\\'s interface is clean, easy to read and uncluttered. Naturally, it uses Google\\'s own apps by default. Samsung, meanwhile, loads its phones up with its own browser, email client and photo gallery, all of which sit beside Google\\'s Chrome, Gmail and Photos apps, meaning you already have duplicates of each tool.\\xa0Samsung is not the only phone-maker to do this. Almost all Android phone companies load their phones up with at least their own browser and gallery app, while some companies, like Samsung and Honor, go as far as making their own email clients and calendars.\\xa0 With its pure Android software, the Pixel 9 Pro offers a super-clean and easy-to-use experience. Andrew Lanxon/CNETI recently reviewed the\\xa0Honor 400 Pro,\\xa0and one of the big issues I found with that phone was how much unsolicited stuff comes pre-loaded as standard. Third-party apps from TikTok, LinkedIn, WPS office, Temu and a variety of others are all right there as soon as you turn it on for the first time, making the phone feel cluttered, bloated and complicated before you\\'ve even had a chance to install one app of your own. The Pixel has none of this.It\\'s the same with AI tools. Samsung has its Bixby assistant, plus a huge variety of its own AI functions. The Honor 400 Pro packs a bunch of AI features for real-time translation and transcription, as do the OnePlus 13 and various other recent Android phones. But they all come with Google\\'s Gemini Advanced, too, along with Circle to Search. The Pixel doesn\\'t need to pointlessly double up. If you want to use AI with your phone, its tools are baked into the heart of the phone experience without you needing to also activate and sign into a third-party service.This simple approach extends to the camera, too. Open the default camera app and you\\'re met with a neat interface, comprised mostly of the shutter button and zoom levels, with other shooting modes found alongside. It doesn\\'t try to overcomplicate things here, instead letting you quickly shoot images without messing about with settings.\\xa0It\\'s an approach that works here, and as a result, the Pixel 9 Pro takes some of my favorite automatic images from a phone camera, doing a great job of balancing exposure and colors. I love the Xiaomi 15 Ultra\\'s camera, but to get the best from it, you need to shoot in Pro mode, taking manual control of the settings, which makes it more suited to advanced photographers who want to fine-tune their images.\\xa0 The camera\\'s simple software makes it easy to take photos with little effort on your part. Andrew Lanxon/CNETThe Pixel does offer deeper control if you want it, conveniently hidden behind a small settings icon, rather than requiring you to switch completely into a \"Pro\" mode. For those of you wanting to take manual control of your white balance to warm up a beautiful sunset, the Pixel 9 Pro offers an easy way in.The specs6.3-inch LTPO OLED display, 2,856x1,280 pixel resolution, 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rateGoogle Tensor G4 processor16GB RAM4,700-mAh battery50 megapixel main camera, 48 megapixel ultrawide, 48 megapixel telephoto zoomCNET\\'s buying adviceGoogle has clearly taken notes from Apple\\'s approach in making the Pixel range. Apple\\'s phones may be derided by Android fans for their lack of customization and \"locked down\" nature, but iPhones are famously more simple to operate. They have integrated hardware, software and services that make them easy to understand whether you\\'re new to smartphones or a veteran gadget obsessive.\\xa0Apple\\'s \"you do things our way\" approach is a big part of the phone\\'s success, and the Pixel 9 Pro feels like the closest approximation of the Apple experience you can find on Android. If you\\'re looking for a clean experience with a smartphone that doesn\\'t try and get in your way with needless extras, the Pixel 9 Pro is certainly worth a look.

Older friends and family may have different priorities, and with discounts, multi-line deals and extras, there\\'s a lot to consider when choosing the best phone plan for seniors. Some of these offer more data per month while others add mobile hotspot data as well as bundled extras like subscriptions to streaming services.

Despite the value, Essentials Choice 55 still has 5G connectivity and 50GB of data, which is a generous allotment for a no-frills service without the extra bells and whistles of pricier plans. Sarah Tew/CNETOther carriers also offer their own discounted plans for people age 55 and older. These options can be combined with other deals and can be helpful for those on fixed incomes. Plans typically have some or all of the same features as standard plans from the same carrier. For the most part, subscribers shouldn\\'t expect much difference in service, but some of these plans may be missing fun perks like bundled streaming services. Best senior phone plans of 2025 Pros\\nThe most affordable option among the three carriers\\n5G connectivity and 50GB of high-speed data in the US\\nAn affordable plan for seniors who just want to use their phone for basic apps and tasks without watching much video\\nCons\\nThe plan only allows a maximum of two lines\\nThe 480p video quality is very low\\nThe 3G tethering speed is too slow for much more than checking email\\nThe plan lacks bundled extras like streaming service subscriptions\\nFor one or two people who just want to stay connected at reasonable speeds but don\\'t need a lot of extra features (or don\\'t want to pay too much), T-Mobile offers a significantly cheaper plan for older adults than competitors with Essentials Choice 55. This plan includes 5G access and is $45 per month for one line or $60 per month total for two lines when signed up for autopay. It\\'s the best value for one or two people, though they won\\'t be able to expand to three or four lines.\\xa0The tradeoff is in the fine print, with Essentials Choice 55 customers getting lower speeds when they use over 50GB of data in a month or when T-Mobile\\'s network is congested from extensive customer activity, suggesting these customers are less prioritized than others. Video quality also \"typically\" streams at 480p, and tethering maxes out at 3G speeds (or 2G speeds in Mexico and Canada). The plan does give users access to T-Mobile\\'s Scam Shield, an app service that can auto-block suspected scam calls and let you change your number once a year if the calls get overwhelming. On the other hand, its mobile hotspot data is limited to T-Mobile\\'s older, slower 3G network.The plan also doesn\\'t get two perks T-Mobile introduced in recent months: a 5-year\\xa0 guarantee of locked plan prices\\xa0as well as satellite connectivity beyond T-Mobile\\'s network via SpaceX\\'s Starlink satellites, which is free for now for other plans. \\xa0... Show more Pros\\nCheaper than regular plans if not using autopay\\nHas the same bundled perks as the standard Go5G Plus and Go5G Next plans\\nNew phone upgrade every two years (Go5G Plus 55) or every year (Experience Beyond w/ 55+)\\nAble to add up to four lines\\nCons\\nSame price as standard T-Mobile Go5G plans if using autopay\\nMore expensive than the Essentials Choice 55 plan\\nT-Mobile also offers discounted versions of many of its regular plans for customers over 55 years old. For those who want a bit more functionality, data and some extras like getting a new phone every couple of years, T-Mobile\\'s slightly discounted Go5G Plus 55 is worth checking out. Its Go5G Plus 55 plan is $75 per month for one line or $110 per month for two lines (expandable to $165 per month for three lines or $220 per month for four lines) with autopay enabled. Note that current discounts make this plan cost the same as a standard Go5G Plus plan if using autopay, but it\\'s less than the regular plan if you don\\'t plan on using autopay. The plan includes the same perks as T-Mobile\\'s standard plans, like up to 4K streaming, 50GB of 4G LTE hotspot data and 15GB of high-speed data (depending on the area, it may only be 4G LTE rather than 5G speeds) in Mexico and Canada. Plus, it includes subscriptions to Apple TV Plus and Netflix.This plan also allows subscribers to upgrade their phone every two years, the same marquee perk that the standard Go5G Plus plan launched with. The only caveat is that plan owners will need to pay off 50% of their existing phone by the time they upgrade, but that shouldn\\'t be too much of a problem for most subscribers. Subscribers can also get the same discounts on devices that T-Mobile offers new customers switching from other carriers.\\xa0The Experience Beyond w/ 55+ plan is pricier at $85 per month for one line or $130 per month for two lines (also expandable up to four lines) but offers a few extras -- most notably that subscribers can upgrade their phones using new customer device offers every year instead of every two years. But this plan also gets access to Hulu with ads, a 5-year price guarantee and satellite connectivity service beyond T-Mobile\\'s network.\\xa0Note that T-Mobile also offers Go5G 55 plan, which is cheaper than the above plans but offers less mobile hotspot data, fewer streaming services and doesn\\'t include two-year phone upgrades. If you can live without the phone upgrades and want to save a few bucks every month, opt for the Go5G 55 plan, which is $60 per month for one line or $90 for two lines, has 15GB of hotspot data per month and offers Netflix with ads. One perk every T-Mobile 55+ plan has: only the customer who signed up for these plans needs to be 55 years old or older, anyone on additional lines needn\\'t fit that criteria. \\xa0... Show more Pros\\nNotably discounted plan\\nLarge hotspot budget for the price\\nCons\\nUnclear when 5G speeds kick in\\nNo bundled extra features\\nAT&T recently renovated its senior offering with a new AT&T 55+ plan, which starts at $40 for one line or $70 for two lines. The plan\\'s listing says it has \"unlimited talk, text & data\" as well as \"5G access included,\" but doesn\\'t specify when or where subscribers will have access to 5G speeds when using data.\\xa0The AT&T 55+ plan doesn\\'t have any extra features like bundled streaming services, but it does offer 10GB of hotspot data per month, which is a sizable amount for customers who like connecting their devices through their phone.\\xa0 \\xa0... Show more Pros\\nVery affordable\\nIdeal for limited budgets\\nCons\\nDiscount diminishes if not buying a year in advance\\nData cap is limited (other carriers offer as much as 50GB)\\nNo bundled extras\\nHotspot usage counts against the main data cap\\nMint Mobile\\'s Mint 55 Plus plan is a modest but affordable plan that can be as cheap as $15 per month per line if signing up for 12 months in advance, $20 a month for six months or $25 per month for three months (customers must sign up for a minimum of three months). New customers can try the network for three months at a rate of $15 a month. After the promotional period ends, prices increase.\\xa0The tradeoff is that the Mint 55 Plus plan only offers 5GB of data per month, and mobile hotspot usage draws from that cap. Mint runs on T-Mobile\\'s 5G network, providing similar 5G and 4G LTE service and availability as native T-Mobile customers. The plan doesn\\'t offer any bundled extras like streaming service subscriptions, but it does provide access to the \"MINTech Advisor\" for on-call tech support in getting started with the plan, transferring phone numbers to the service and troubleshooting issues.Currently, you can\\'t sign up for Mint 55 Plus online. You\\'ll need to call Mint\\'s hotline at 833-655-1768 to sign up over a call. \\xa0... Show more Pros\\nDiscounted plans for residents of Florida\\nCons\\nNot available to US residents in the other states or territories\\nNo bundled extra features\\nVerizon has discounted plans for people aged 55 years and older, but they come with a huge caveat: They\\'re available only to those living in Florida. If you meet this requirement, you can get discounted plans that are pretty similar to the standard Verizon plans.Verizon offers its 55 Plus Unlimited plan with one line for $62 per month or $84 for two lines when signed up for autopay. New customers switching to Verizon may have an easier time signing up; if you\\'re already a Verizon customer, you\\'ll need to talk to customer support to get your plan changed to Unlimited 55. The plan includes 5G Ultra Wideband service with unlimited low-speed (600Kbps) mobile hotspot access but lacks the bundled extras like streaming services you can add to conventional Verizon plans. \\xa0... Show moreCheck that you\\'re actually saving money: Are you getting a better deal than a carrier\\'s standard plans and offers? Most seniors-only plans don\\'t provide substantial differences, so make sure it\\'s worth pursuing.\\xa0Ensure availability: Some are restricted to certain states or limited in other ways, so it\\'s worth checking the fine print to determine whether you\\'re arbitrarily shut out from an otherwise appealing plan.Check the coverage area: See if users around you are happy with their carrier and plan. Online forums, social media and even asking around the neighborhood can be helpful to determine whether you\\'re about to sign up for disappointing speeds and service. If you\\'re converting to a senior plan with your existing carrier, check to see if competitors offer better service. For that, here\\'s our guide to switching carriers.Picking a wireless plan and carrier comes down to what matters most. What works for you or your older family member\\'s needs may be very different from those of your friends or neighbors.\\xa0We prioritize affordability and availability in our list, but those may not be the most important factors for you. If not, we recommend checking out our more general guides for plans, like our best cellphone plans and best family phone plans.\\xa0Value for older customers aside, every carrier differs in service. Even geographically, some areas have better AT&T coverage while others work better with Verizon or T-Mobile\\'s networks. Our recommendations are based on years of covering and evaluating the wireless carriers, their offerings and their performance.\\xa0 What is the cheapest phone plan for seniors? Mint Mobile\\'s Mint 55 Plus Plan is the cheapest phone plan for seniors, starting at $15 per month if you buy for a full year in advance. Even its minimum three-month plan at $25 per month is more affordable than plans from other carriers. The drawback is that it\\'s a prepaid plan, meaning you\\'ll have to pay in advance in months-long increments. Also, while Mint Mobile was bought by T-Mobile and operates on its network, its customers may see slower speeds than T-Mobile customers due to deprioritization.\\nShow more\\nAre there free phone plans for seniors? US carriers currently don\\'t offer free plans for seniors. Certain discount offers can help, which vary between states and counties. The federal LifeLine program provides assistance for low-income Americans which seniors can apply for, and certain states have their own similar programs to offer additional aid like the California LifeLine program.\\nShow more\\nWhat\\'s the difference between prepaid and postpaid plans? Postpaid plans are what most carriers offer, billing users at the end of the month and potentially penalizing cancellation before set times. On the upside, carriers often sweeten the deal with bundled features like streaming service subscriptions and offers for discounts on new phones.

But now, there’s a real possibility that things might change for the better. We’ve known for a while through leaks and rumors that Google’s upcoming Tensor G5 chip would be produced by TSMC instead of Samsung Foundry. But a new report from Digitimes, cited by Android Authority, adds a fresh twist: this isn’t a one-off manufacturing swap. According to the report, Google and TSMC have struck a long-term deal that could span the next five Pixel generations, through the Pixel 14.\\nSamsung Foundry and the Pixel’s Performance Bottleneck\\nThe Pixel 8 is my daily driver, and no doubt, it’s a great phone. But the Tensor still doesn’t stack up against the best from Qualcomm or MediaTek. I usually get a full day of battery life, but there are days when I find myself reaching for the charger twice. And when I look at how Chinese brands like OnePlus are pushing the envelope with ultra-fast charging and delivering two-day battery life easily, it’s hard not to feel a little left out. Add to that the performance coming from chips like the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and 8 Elite, which offer incredible gaming capabilities, and I can’t help but expect more from my Pixel.\\nLucas Gouveia/How-To Geek\\nTo be fair, Tensor has come a long way—G3 was a big step up from G1 and G2, and G4 does bring small gains—but seeing how fast Qualcomm is advancing on all fronts makes those Tensor improvements feel incremental at best. A big part of that might come down to Samsung Foundry, which has handled Tensor chip production since the beginning. We’ve seen similar issues before—Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, built by Samsung, ran hot and inefficient. But when Qualcomm switched to TSMC for the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, everything improved, even though the architecture stayed the same. So if that’s what a foundry switch did for Qualcomm, it’s reasonable to hope for something similar from Google’s rumored move to TSMC.\\nWhat TSMC Could Unlock for Pixel\\nTSMC is widely seen as the best chipmaker in the business. From Apple’s M-series to most of Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragons, TSMC’s fabrication processes consistently lead the industry in power efficiency and thermal control. The Tensor G5 is rumored to be built on a 3nm node, which should bring real gains in battery life and cooling. That could also have ripple effects across the Pixel’s hardware. Take charging speeds, for example. The Pixel 9 Pro XL tops out at 37W wired charging—not terrible, but far behind competitors like the OnePlus 13 and its 100W speeds. Better chip efficiency could mean a higher sustained power draw, which might allow Google to close that gap without concerns about overheating.\\nRelated\\nA Long-Term Bet—If It Pays Off\\nIf the report is true, and Google really has signed a multi-year agreement with TSMC, it’s a sign that this isn’t just a fix for the Pixel 10. It’s a foundational shift in Google’s silicon strategy. And that’s encouraging, because if there’s one thing Tensor has lacked since day one, it’s a sense of long-term competitiveness. But here’s the thing: switching foundries doesn’t automatically solve everything.\\nWhat if the Problem Isn’t Just Samsung?\\nThere’s a fair question to ask here: what if Tensor’s issues aren’t about the foundry, but the design itself? Even with the Tensor G4 showing some progress, Pixel phones still fall short in raw performance and sustained efficiency. If those problems persist in the TSMC-made G5, then Google’s chip architecture may be the deeper issue. After all, Qualcomm didn’t just rely on better manufacturing—they also refined their chip design significantly.\\nGoogle\\nSo yes, this rumored shift is exciting. But it also puts the spotlight firmly on Google. If the Tensor G5 doesn’t deliver even with TSMC’s backing, there won’t be many excuses left.\\nCautiously Optimistic\\nAs a Pixel fan, this is the most hopeful I’ve felt in a while. If this TSMC rumor pans out, and Google brings its A-game to design, we could finally get a Pixel phone with no glaring hardware compromises. A phone that doesn’t overheat while shooting 4K videos in daylight. One that lasts longer, charges faster, and doesn’t feel like it’s playing catch-up with every launch cycle. But this is also a make-or-break moment. Either this rumored move to TSMC kickstarts a new era of Pixel excellence, or it confirms that Google’s silicon troubles run deeper than anyone wants to admit.\\nWrapping Up\\nThe upcoming Pixel 10 is going to be an important phone for Google. We’ve already talked about the camera upgrades expected this year and some pretty thoughtful accessibility features that are in the works. Oh, and let’s not forget the full-on ad shoot that leaked online — easily one of the goofiest Pixel leaks I’ve seen in a while.\\nJust like last year, Google is expected to unveil the Pixel 10 series in August, so we can definitely expect more tidbits to drop in the coming weeks.\\n```\\n\\n## [I\\'ve handled the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus, and it could be the sweet spot of the Galaxy family](https://www.techradar.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review) (#105650)\\n\\n> 2025-06-05 04:00:00+00:00\\n\\n```\\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is a remarkably lightweight phone, and it feels different than anything else I’ve tried. The phone offers top-notch performance and stays cool under pressure, but the battery life isn’t great, and the charging speed is too slow. This phone fills a niche for Samsung fans, but it won’t win over a new audience or raise eyebrows among the competition. It’s just a slimmer option for folks who weren’t satisfied with the current Galaxy lineup.

The goal was to make a Galaxy S25 Plus that’s easier to hold, but Samsung did not set out to make the thinnest phone possible – in fact the Galaxy S25 Edge isn’t even the thinnest phone Samsung makes today. Instead, it did what Samsung does best: it gave us a little more inside a little less.The Galaxy S25 Edge is a very good phone, and it feels like something unique compared to every other phone I’ve reviewed. The difference is noticeable; it’s much slimmer and lighter than almost everything else, even when wearing a case. Still, the S25 Edge isn’t a revolutionary new design, and I can’t help but anticipate the competition it’s going to face from Apple in the shape of the rumored iPhone 17 Air.This is the thinnest Galaxy S device Samsung has ever crafted. It’s 1.5mm thinner than the Galaxy S25 Plus, and almost 2.5mm thinner than the Galaxy S25 UItra.Could I feel that millimeter in my hand? I’m not sure, but between the thinness and the weight reduction – it’s almost a full ounce lighter than the Plus and two ounces lighter than the Ultra – the Galaxy S25 Edge is undoubtedly a standout.Front to back: Galaxy S25 Edge, Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, Galaxy S25 Ultra (Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)The Galaxy S25 Edge isn’t the phone for you if you want the thinnest phone possible. It’s the phone for you if you want a Galaxy S25 Plus, but wish it were easier to hold. It’s the Galaxy S25 Ultra, minus the extra bits that you wouldn’t use, like the S Pen stylus. It’s not something totally new, but it’s a better option for the right buyer.But why didn’t Samsung go for broke? Why not make the Edge the absolute thinnest smartphone ever? The Galaxy Z Fold 6 is 5.6mm thin when it’s unfolded. Had it shaved another 0.3mm off the Edge, Samsung could have at least said that this is the thinnest Samsung phone you can buy.The answer, of course, is battery life. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 is super thin, but the battery is split between the two halves. Each half of the Z Fold 6 packs only about 2,200mAh of battery life (for 4,400mAh total), which is a lot less than the 3,800mAh the Galaxy S25 Edge offers.A thinner Galaxy S25 Edge would have meant a smaller battery, and based on my testing, the S25 Edge is using the smallest battery it can get away with.The Edge had trouble lasting past dinner time in my testing period. If Samsung had made the Edge the thinnest phone ever!, it probably wouldn’t last through my lunch break. I have no doubt Samsung could build such a phone, but I wouldn’t recommend it.That makes the S25 Edge a pleasantly thin phone that is simply not very special. There are no special features that set it apart from the rest of the Galaxy S25 family. There’s nothing new here. It’s a well-crafted device that delivers exactly what I expected; no more and no less. That’s not a bad thing! It’s just… predictable.Front to back: Galaxy S25 Edge, iPhone 16 Pro Max, Galaxy S25 Ultra (Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)The big problem is that Samsung is competing against a specter. The iPhone 17 Air could arrive later this year, and it’s hard not to see the Galaxy S25 Edge as a preemptive attack by Samsung on Apple’s next design concept. Because make no mistake, Apple is going to make a big deal out of going thin.Apple is going to pretend it invented the millimeter. If and when Apple launches an iPhone Air in September, it will act like thinness is the biggest design innovation since the capacitive touchscreen. All other specs be damned! And I think Apple will be willing to shrink the battery and cut back on cameras even more severely than Samsung.If that happens, the iPhone 17 Air will probably be less capable than the Galaxy S25 Edge in many ways, but it will give Apple the all-important bragging rights. Apple could use the dual-OLED display found on the iPad Pro, and recent rumors suggest the rumored phone will be around 5.5mm, making it thinner than any phone Samsung currently sells.In a way, this takes the pressure off Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Edge is a very nice phone, and it fits neatly into Samsung’s price ladder as a little nicer than the Galaxy S25 Plus, but not as feature-packed as the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It doesn’t need to prove anything – the Galaxy S25 Edge does fine with less, without trying to be the most.Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge review: Price and availabilityStarts at $1,099 / £1,099 / AU$1,849 for 256GB/12GB configurationThat’s $100 / £100 / AU$500 more than S25 Plus, $200 / £150 less than the UltraLeft to right: Galaxy S25 Ultra, Galaxy S25 Edge, Galaxy S25 Plus, Galaxy S25 (Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)The Galaxy S25 Edge slots in neatly between the Galaxy S25 Plus and S25 Ultra in Samsung’s lineup. It’s closer to the Plus, which makes sense because it lacks more of the Ultra features than it possesses – there’s no S Pen, no telescopic zoom lens, and no big battery inside, for instance, although it is, like the S25 Ultra, built from titanium.Otherwise, you get most of what you’d expect from the Galaxy S25 Plus, minus the zoom camera. It packs a sensor with a lot of megapixels, and that sensor is actually larger than the main sensor on the Galaxy S25 Plus. Both cameras use sensors that are smaller than the main 200MP sensor on the mighty Galaxy S25 Ultra.Now I need a moment with my Australian friends, because something very odd is happening down under. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has come down in price by AU$400 since launch, which means it costs less than the Galaxy S25 Edge by AU$100. Also, the S25 Edge seems priced a bit high in Australia compared to the rest of the world – it’s AU$500 more than the Galaxy S25 Plus?! That seems like a mistake, but it’s the real price for now, so I would wait until Samsung offers a discount to buy the Edge.Swipe to scroll horizontallyStorageUS priceUK priceAU price256GB$1,099£1,099AU$1,849512GB$1,219£1,199AU$2,049Value score: 4 / 5Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge review: SpecsSamsung Galaxy S25 Edge (left) and Galaxy S25 Plus (right) are very similar inside (Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)Like the rest of the Galaxy S25 family, the S25 Edge gets 12GB of RAM to support the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset inside. This platform has proven powerful and very efficient in my reviews of the best Android phones this year.The 6.7-inch display on the S25 Edge seems to be identical to that on the S25 Plus. The main camera uses a new 200MP sensor that we haven’t seen before, which is a bit smaller than the 200MP sensor on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but larger than the 50MP sensor on the Galaxy S25 Plus. There’s no telephoto lens, but the Edge seems to use the same 12MP ultrawide camera as the S25 Plus.The Galaxy S25 Edge comes with a 3,900mAh battery under its display, which is even smaller than the 4,000mAh battery beneath the Galaxy S25’s 6.2-inch screen. That’s what you sacrifice when you make a phone thin.Swipe to scroll horizontallyHeader Cell - Column 0 Samsung Galaxy S25Dimensions158.2 x 75.6 x 5.8mmWeight163gOSOneUI 7, Android 15. 7 major Android upgrades promised.Display6.7-inch LTPO AMOLED, 120HzChipsetQualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for GalaxyRAM12GBStorage256GB / 512GBBattery3,900mAhRear cameras200MP main, 12MP ultra-wideFront camera12MPCharging25W wired, 15W wirelessColorsTitanium Silver, Titanium Icyblue, Titanium JetblackSamsung Galaxy S25 Edge review: DesignFeels exceptionally light when you hold itEven with a case, it’s a very thin phone(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)The real selling point for the Galaxy S25 Edge isn’t the thinness, it’s the lightness. You have to hold this phone to appreciate it; you can’t just look at the S25 Edge if you want to experience how thin and light it is. Photos don’t do justice to the remarkably light weight, and that’s a big part of the experience.If you get pinky-finger fatigue from balancing your phone, the S25 Edge might be the phone that will save your favorite digit. Even though it has a huge 6.7-inch display, the Galaxy S25 Edge is lighter than the iPhone 16 (6.1-inch screen, 170g), or the Pixel 9 (6.3-inch screen, 198g). It’s only one gram heavier than the 6.2-inch Galaxy S25, but it feels lighter since it’s less dense.I almost always use a case with my phone, and since Samsung did not have cases ready for my review period, I asked my friends at Casetify to send over their thinnest cases for the Galaxy S25 Edge. Even with a case on the phone, it still feels remarkably thin and light, especially considering that huge screen size. My S25 Edge in a protective Casetify shell is still lighter than my Galaxy S25 Ultra with no case.Image 1 of 3The Galaxy S25 Ultra is almost as thick as the Galaxy S25 Edge in a case, including the camera bump(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)The design overall looks nearly identical to that of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but on very close inspection things are less impressive. Frankly, the build quality of the Galaxy S25 Edge seems messy compared to the Ultra or to any Apple iPhone.There are gaps between the frame and the back glass. The SIM card tray doesn’t line up perfectly. There’s a gap between the camera bump and the back of the phone that I worried would pick up dirt – and by the end of my review period, that was the dingiest part of the phone.(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)This phone could have been special. Samsung could have tried something new, like capacitive buttons on the side – a trick that rumors say Apple is considering. It could have had super-fast charging to go with that slim battery. It could have had unique colors or a unique finish.Instead, it’s just a slimmer version of a phone we got six months ago, and it’s not even a really nice version at that.Design score: 3 / 5Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge review: DisplayMore Galaxy S25 Plus than Ultra, but that’s pretty greatFingerprint scanner was totally unreliable(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)The Galaxy S25 Edge, like the Galaxy S25 Plus, is sort of a hidden gem in Samsung’s lineup when it comes to display quality. While the S25 Ultra has a slightly-larger 6.9-inch screen, all three phones all have the same resolution. When you pack the same pixels into a smaller display, you get a screen that’s technically sharper, in terms of pixel density.Which is to say the Galaxy S25 Edge has a fantastic screen, one of the best you can find on any phone. It is plenty bright, even in bright sunlight, though the Ultra does beat the Edge thanks to the addition of the remarkable coating that Samsung has been using for a couple of years to eliminate glare on its flagship flat phone.The display can refresh at up to 120Hz – take that iPhone 16 Plus – and thanks to LTPO tech you can even get a full-color always-on display that refreshes as slowly as 1Hz to save power.I’ve never had great luck with Samsung’s fingerprint scanners, and the S25 Edge didn’t recognize me any faster than other Galaxy phones, and unlocking failed more often than not. I know I have fingerprints because my OnePlus 13 sees them with 99% accuracy, so I assume this is a Samsung problem, not a me problem.Display score: 5 / 5Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge review: SoftwareOneUI 7 is well built, but doesn’t add much to the Edge experienceAI features can be useful, but many feel like even more bloat(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)For better and for worse, the Galaxy S25 Edge uses the same One UI 7 interface as the rest of the Galaxy S25 family, with Android 15 serving as the engine. Samsung and Google seem to be locked in a perpetual struggle to control Samsung’s phones, so you’ll get two web browsers, two photo gallery apps, even two wallets and two different password managers.It’s getting to be a bit much. I’m the first to insist that Samsung’s software – like its Internet web browser – performs better than Google’s alternative. But nobody wants two of everything; you don’t get an extra steering wheel when you buy a car. It’s time for Samsung to end the duplicate-apps project.(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)There are plenty of Galaxy AI features on the phone, and it comes with Google Gemini preloaded and ready to take over the power button at your beck and call.I think we may have already hit the wall with AI features. Samsung has been touting its Now Brief widget and app since the Galaxy S25 launched, and it’s a completely useless piece of software. It’s supposed to learn things about me and then offer information tailored to my needs, but nothing like that happens.I’ve been wearing a Galaxy Watch Ultra and Galaxy Buds 3 Pro while using the S25 Edge for weeks. The Now Brief offers no more than today’s weather, a missive that feels creepy coming from an AI (‘Wishing you well’?!), and the first few events on my work calendar, which are usually the first three people who took the day off and logged it properly.(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)At worst, Now Brief offers me partisan political news. I filter out most politics from my social feeds, and I don’t talk about politics in my text messages, so I’m not sure why Now Brief thinks politics are what interests me. It’s inescapable.Thankfully, Samsung has confirmed that the Galaxy S25 Edge will get seven years of major Android and security updates, so it should last through Android 22, just like the rest of the Galaxy S25 family.Software score: 3 / 5Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge review: CamerasExactly what I expected based on the specsSamsung’s processing can be fun, or inconsistent(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)When I heard that the Galaxy S25 Edge would use fewer cameras than its S25 stablemates, with one big 200MP main sensor and a supporting ultra-wide, I was excited at the prospect. After all, one of Leica’s most popular cameras, the Leica Q3, uses a single large sensor and a wide lens, and fakes all of the zoom with digital cropping. If anybody can pull off the same trick on a camera phone, it’s Samsung.Nope. I’m disappointed to say the cameras are fine, but not groundbreaking. I was hoping the Edge would be a trendsetter. Instead, it runs down the middle of the road without faltering. It does a great job at the things Samsung camera phones do well, but it can’t handle the all-in-one duties of the Galaxy S25 Ultra.There are no surprises with the Galaxy S25 Edge cameras. The main camera uses a 200MP sensor with a wide lens, and that sensor is a bit smaller than the 200MP sensor on the Galaxy S25 Ultra. No surprise then that the Ultra is still the best Samsung camera phone, in more ways than one.(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)The main camera produces images that are a bit fuzzier than what I got from the Galaxy S25 Ultra, and I was surprised to find the colors dialed back a bit as well. The Edge’s cameras don’t seem to be tuned to pop colors as much as the Ultra cameras do. It still managed to take excellent food photos and warm portraits, like I expect from Samsung.Image 1 of 2Taken with Galaxy S25 Edge(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)Galaxy S25 Edge 100% cropIf you need a zoom lens, the S25 Edge isn’t going to satisfy you. The digital zoom doesn’t come close to providing the detail and quality I get with optical zoom on the Galaxy S25 Ultra and iPhone 16 Pro Max. A heron across the river looked like a white, featherless blob when I snapped a pic with the Edge. The iPhone and Galaxy Ultra images revealed a beak and some plumage.Image 1 of 2Taken with the Galaxy S25 Edge(Image credit: Philip BerneFuture)Galaxy S25 Edge 10X digital zoomIf you take a lot of photos outdoors, the S25 Ultra has a coating on the display to reduce glare, and it makes a big difference even compared to the S25 Edge, which has a nearly-identical display otherwise. The Edge can get bright, but it’s much easier to see the Ultra’s screen if the sun is shining directly on you.Camera score: 3 / 5Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge review: Camera samplesImage 1 of 7(Image credit: Philip BerneFuture)Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge review: PerformanceExcellent performance from the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 EliteThe Edge stayed very cool under conditions that break other phones (Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)I was expecting excellent performance from the Galaxy S25 Edge, and this phone delivered beyond my expectations. It was plenty fast, with that overclocked Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset providing a bit more boost than you’ll get on a non-Samsung Snapdragon phone. Samsung has also done a remarkable job of keeping the phone cool, even when you push the performance to the limit.I perform a stress test where I run multiple mapping apps on a phone, and play music over Bluetooth, then sit the phone above my car dashboard in the sunshine. Most phones take less than an hour of this punishment before they shut down due to overheating.The S25 Edge never quit, managing to stay cool enough to function for as long as I needed. That’s incredible – every iPhone, Pixel phone, and Galaxy phone I’ve tested has failed this endurance test. The Edge really lives up to Samsung’s claims of much better cooling – that 10% larger vapor chamber clearly makes a real difference.This makes the Galaxy S25 Edge an easy contender for a best gaming phone ranking. It offers great performance and superior cooling – everything a gaming phone needs.I also had fun playing games with the Galaxy S25 Edge clipped onto my Xbox wireless controller using a cheap third-party attachment from Amazon. The phone is so lightweight that gaming for long periods was a breeze – it’s a nice way to kill time while I wait for my Switch 2 to arrive.Performance score: 5 / 5Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge review: Battery Good battery for the thin size, but not greatCouldn’t last a full day if I used it aggressively (Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)As I said above, Samsung could have made a thinner Galaxy S25 Edge, but the battery life would be terrible – as it is, during my review period the S25 Edge often needed a recharge while I was eating dinner, especially if I played games, took a lot of photos, or otherwise taxed the phone heavily.If I scrolled my social feeds and listened to music on the train into work, I would be concerned about whether the battery would last until the train ride home.It’s too bad Samsung didn’t use the latest silicon carbon battery technology found in the OnePlus 13, which might have helped it to pack in more power. I also wish this phone charged faster than other Galaxy S25 models, not slower – if it had 80W charging like the latest OnePlus phones I wouldn’t be worried about having to top up throughout the day, because that top-up would take less than 15 minutes.(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)As it stands, 15 minutes of charging got me just past 25%, and a full charge took about an hour. That’s pretty slow by today’s standards, especially considering that this battery is smaller than any other inside a Galaxy S25 phone.Samsung might also be exaggerating its battery claims. It told us to expect the Edge to offer longevity somewhere between the Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S25, but in our lab benchmark tests the S25 Edge lasted for less than 13 hours of constant use where the Galaxy S24 lasted more than 13 hours, and the Galaxy S25 topped 15 hours.If you really need good battery life the Galaxy S25 Plus is the Samsung champ, delivering almost 19 hours of screen time in our rundown test. But it’s not the Edge’s lack of battery life as such that bugs me; it’s how long it takes to top the phone up.Battery score: 3 / 5Swipe to scroll horizontallySamsung Galaxy S25 Edge score cardValueNot a bad price for the svelte design and pocketability.

I received the Edge before I traveled to Google I/O, and I took the phone along as my primary work device and for entertainment on flights.When I got back from Google I/O I had Covid, so the Galaxy S25 Edge was my primary couch companion, and my source of entertainment and contact with the world. I used it to play games, watch movies, and listen to audiobooks.When I’d recovered, I took the S25 Edge car shopping and connected it to a number of different cars to test. I used the phone to take photos, research cars, and more. I even asked for help from Google Gemini and Samsung’s Galaxy AI to do research, answer calls, and respond to solicitors.I connected the Galaxy S25 Edge to a Galaxy Watch Ultra, Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, and an Xbox Wireless controller, among numerous other devices.Future Labs tests phones using a mix of third-party benchmark software and proprietary, real-world tests.

It flows seamlessly into the Apple ecosystem, with frequent software updates that keep it feeling fresh and health features that build on the strengths of both devices to help you reach your goals. But not all Apple Watches are created equal and understanding the differences is key to finding the right fit for your needs and budget. Whether you\\'re buying your first Apple Watch, upgrading an older model or shopping for a family member, we’ve highlighted the best smartwatch options to help you land on the right choice.

The Apple Watch Series 10 takes everything great about its predecessors and elevates it. Compared to the Series 9, it offers a larger, brighter screen without adding bulk (it\\'s actually lighter), more power under the hood and faster charging than any other Apple Watch, including the Ultra 2.While its features may not drastically differ from the Series 9, its next-gen processor ensures it will likely outlast its predecessor in terms of software updates. It also includes a few more subtle upgrades, like voice isolation for calls, music playback and a depth gauge with a water temperature sensor for aquatic activities.Best Apple Watches for 2025 Pros\\nIncredibly light on the wrist\\n1Hz refresh rate = ticking second hand!\\nVoice isolation on calls is excellent\\nBigger screen makes readability better on the smaller size case\\nSleep apnea notifications at launch\\nCons\\nNo improvements to battery life\\nNo significant changes to Double Tap\\nSmallest 42-mm size might still be too big for some wrists\\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 takes a winning formula and updates it for the Apple Watch\\'s tenth birthday. It is slimmer and lighter than earlier Apple Watches, with two new case sizes: 42 millimeter or 46 millimeter. The wide-angle OLED screens make the watch brighter when looking at it off-axis. And the LTPO3 technology also brings a ticking second hand to the always-on display. The Apple Watch Series 10 also comes with sleep apnea notifications, which can detect signs of this potentially dangerous condition over a 30-day period.Battery life is still rated for 18 hours although you can push it to a day and a half with lighter use. The Apple Watch Series 10 now has even faster charging though, which makes up for the battery life somewhat, able to charge to 80% in 30 minutes. Overall, it\\'s an incredibly polished smartwatch and the best choice for most iPhone owners.Why we like itThe Series 10 is a refined version of its predecessors on the surface and under the hood. It’s lighter and slimmer than the Series 9 but has a larger, brighter screen that’s easier to read from every angle. It has the most powerful processor of the entire Apple Watch lineup and, as a result, longer shelf life for software updates. Plus it comes with additional perks, like the ability to play music through the speaker and background noise reduction during calls.Who it’s best forThe Series 10 is ideal for most iPhone users upgrading from an existing Apple Watch, or anyone deeply invested in the Apple ecosystem who wants a premium smartwatch experience out of the box (including the latest health sensors). It brings enough upgrades to feel like a true step up, while retaining all the features that make the Apple Watch great. \\xa0... Show more Get it now Add to compare Pros\\nLower price\\nSame performance as the Series 8\\nCar-crash detection for additional safety\\nCons\\nNo always-on display\\nNo QWERTY keyboard\\nMost new features can be found on older watches too\\nThe Apple Watch SE retails for $250 but you can regularly find it discounted to $200 or less, which makes it an excellent choice for the budget-conscious buyer. Expect most of the same features found on more expensive Apple Watch models like the Series 9, including activity tracking, third-party apps and safety features like Emergency SOS. It does miss out on an always-on display and heart-health features like the ECG.Why we like itThe second-generation SE offers all the essential features you’d want from an Apple Watch for at least $150 less than what you’d pay for the cheapest model of the Series 10. It covers everything you need, including advanced health and fitness tracking, crash and fall detection, and seamless integration with your iPhone.Who it’s best for\\xa0This is a great option for first-time Apple Watch buyers or anyone upgrading from a much older model (Series 0–4), as it’ll still feel like an upgrade without making you feel like you’re missing out on newer features like the always-on display or advanced health sensors like ECG or temperature tracking, which you never had in the first place. It’s also the best option for children (LTE model) as a way to stay connected with parents or caregivers without having to go all in on a smartphone. \\xa0... Show more Add to compare Pros\\nIncredibly bright screen\\nMore accurate dictation and on-device Siri\\n64GB storage means more space for music and apps\\nDouble Tap is very useful\\nCons\\nBattery life is the same as first Ultra\\nLimited recovery metrics\\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 2 is Apple\\'s best smartwatch, with a tough titanium construction and an Action button to quickly start workouts or launch apps. It has the brightest screen of any Apple Watch at a maximum of 3,000 nits that makes it incredibly easy to see when adventuring in the great outdoors. For adventurers and athletes, it also has a built-in siren for safety and a dual-band GPS for accurately tracking your route. LTE is also onboard so you can venture out without a phone and still stay connected.Although it\\'s designed to be an outdoor watch, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is still a fantastic all-around smartwatch. Inside is the same S9 chip as found on the Apple Watch Series 9 which supports gestures like Double Tap and allows the watch to process Siri commands on-device. This means you can use Siri without being online and later in the year you\\'ll be able to ask the voice assistant for health data. Like earlier Apple Watches, the Ultra 2 also comes with a blood oxygen sensor, electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) app, fall detection and emergency SOS. The battery also lasts at least twice as long as all other Apple Watch models. It\\'s only compatible with the iPhone so if you have an Android phone, you\\'ll want to look at another option on this list.Why we like itThe Apple Watch Ultra 2 is an all-terrain smartwatch that’s built to go the distance with nearly twice the battery life of other Apple Watches (three days on a charge), and a durable, titanium exterior. It has a larger screen than other models and an action button that can be programmed for easy access no matter what the conditions. Extras like dual-band GPS, a built-in siren, and LTE connectivity add another layer of safety when you\\'re off the grid.\\xa0Who it’s best forOutdoor enthusiasts and serious athletes looking for a middle ground between a traditional Apple Watch and a full-fledged sport watch like a Garmin. The Ultra 2 is also a smart pick for current Apple Watch users who are frustrated with daily charging and willing to invest more for an extra day and a half of battery life. \\xa0...

The new watch replaces last year\\'s Apple Watch Series 9 and is the best Apple Watch for most people.All Apple Watches share the same core DNA: a square screen with rounded edges, a rotating crown, interchangeable straps and Apple’s WatchOS with Siri integration. The differences lie in the details with factors like advanced health sensors, durability, battery life and screen size. Oh, and price. Lisa Eadicicco/CNETBudget: If you\\'re on a budget and want the best deal, it might be worth waiting for major discount days like Black Friday when most retailers, including Apple, offer sales or gift-card cash-back incentives. Another way to cut costs is by purchasing a refurbished Apple Watch directly from Apple. They come with the same one-year warranty as new models, eligibility for AppleCare and a 14-day return window.Design: There are a lot of ways to customize your Apple Watch, including different finishes and watch bands. But dressing up your Apple Watch doesn\\'t always come cheap and some of the more premium design options like the titanium finish and stainless steel band can increase the base price by $600. You can also customize the size of your screen; older models or the 2nd SE will have the smallest option (40mm) while the Apple Watch Ultra offers the largest (49mm) display.Battery: Battery life continues to be a major pain point for Apple Watch users, with no model going past the three-day mark like some Android models. And while Apple has made strides in this category, it\\'s best to taper your expectations by accepting that you’ll probably get a day\\'s worth of charge (with the always on display) on most models. If that’s a deal breaker, you\\'ll need to splurge on the Apple Watch Ultra 2, which is the only model that lasts up to 72 hours. Jeff Carlson/CNETWi-Fi Only vs. Cellular: Most users will find the Wi-Fi version sufficient. It tracks workouts and makes mobile payments independently from the phone but needs to be in range of your iPhone to access some of the smart features like notifications, messaging and calls. Cellular and Wi-Fi models are only worth the splurge (an additional $100) if you plan to ditch your iPhone on a regular basis and need the watch to be a standalone device and have access to all the features. And it\\'s your only option if you’re buying the Ultra 2 as it doesn’t offer a Wi-Fi only option.We test all our Apple Watches in the real world and focus on any new features or claims in addition to all the other features you’ll be using on a regular basis like fitness tracking and connectivity. All Apple Watches, including the cellular models, need to connect to an iPhone so we also assess how easy the companion software is to navigate. Carly Marsh/CNETDurability and design: Smartwatches are something you wear on your body so we assess how comfortable they are to wear. We also know that everyone has a different-sized wrist so we try to see how it fits and feels on a variety of people.\\xa0Then we look at how it stands up to wear and tear with daily life. Some models, like the Ultra 2, offer increased durability like dust resistance or water resistance that\\'s suited for activities like scuba diving and, where possible, we\\'ll test this out for ourselves.Battery: Battery life will vary depending on how you use a smartwatch so we test battery life with a few standard tests. We see how long it generally lasts on a single charge with features that represent typical use, like the always-on display, sleep tracking and doing one outdoor workout with GPS. Yes, you can take calls, talk to Siri, or use the Walkie Talkie feature to chat with your friends and family who also have Apple Watches, but you might get some funny looks. Charles Wagner/CNETFitness and health sensor accuracy: We test the accuracy of the Apple Watch using a few different methods. The heart rate sensor, for example, is compared against the readings taken from a chest strap, considered the gold standard in consumer heart rate tracking, during a variety of cardio-based activities like running or cycling. We also check to see how long it takes to connect to a GPS signal when doing an outdoor workout. Other health sensors, like a blood oxygen sensor (not active on newer models), are compared against a pulse oximeter for spot readings where possible, and for the ECG feature, we tested it against a hospital grade ECG.While no longer sold directly by Apple, the Apple Watch Series 9 is still a strong option if you can find it. Stores like Best Buy and Target often have it in stock for about $100 less than the Series 10. You’ll miss out on the larger, redesigned screen and ultra fast charging but it still includes key health features not available on the cheaper SE, like the ECG app, temperature sensing and sleep apnea notifications. What is the best alternative to an Apple Watch? Unless you\\'re ready to switch from your iPhone to an Android device, it\\'s best to avoid Wear OS watches like Samsung’s Galaxy Watch or Google’s Pixel Watch, as they offer limited compatibility with Apple devices. Instead, consider watches that run proprietary operating systems, such as Garmin’s Venu 3 or Huawei’s Watch Fit 3. Garmin is known for its fitness-focused models for athletes but they also offer solid smartwatch features. The Amazfit Active 2 is also worth considering for a simpler, budget-friendly option that covers the basics.\\nShow more\\nWhat is the best Apple Watch for kids? The best Apple Watch for kids is the Apple Watch SE (2nd generation) with Wi-Fi and Cellular. A feature fittingly called \"Apple Watch for your Kids\" allows parents to set up the watch from their own iPhones without needing a separate iPhone for the child. Parents can track the location of their kid in real time and manage who their kids can contact during what times to minimize distractions during school hours. Even if you wanted to treat your kid to one of the newer models, key features like ECG, wrist temperature and sleep tracking are disabled in this mode anyway. Read more: Apple Watch for Kids\\nShow more\\nWhat to know about the blood oxygen sensor If you\\'ve purchased an Apple Watch within the past year, you may notice the Blood Oxygen feature in your app list doesn’t load. This is no coincidence. Apple introduced SpO2 (blood oxygen) tracking with the Series 6 but was forced to disable it in units sold after Jan. 18, 2024, following a patent lawsuit filed by medical tech company Masimo. According to Apple’s website the company is appealing the ruling so it’s possible this feature could make a comeback.\\nShow more\\nSmartwatches are only getting smarter about health and the Apple Watch is no exception. Whether it’s better sensors, new metrics or more personalized coaching, Apple may be taking a queue from competitors like Garmin and Google and leaning more on AI to make sense of your data to personalize insights. One trend I’d love to see the Apple Watch adopt this year is better battery life; smarter software and hardware upgrades like the dual CPU architecture on the OnePlus Watch 3 are finally making multi-day wear feel realistic. Meanwhile, the definition of a wearable is expanding fast with more smart rings making their debuts as well as upgraded earbud options with built-in health sensors that are already nudging into smartwatch territory. They probably won’t replace watches entirely but they’re definitely raising the bar and will continue giving the Apple Watch a healthy push forward.\\n```\\n\\n## [Best Laptops of 2025: Top Picks Tested by Our Experts](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/best-laptop/#ftag=CAD590a51e) (#106991)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 20:30:00+00:00\\n\\n```\\nWe review all kinds of laptops at CNET, from budget models for everyday tasks to high-performance laptops for PC gaming, content creation and everything in between.

The MacBook Air recently received a jolt with an update to Apple’s latest M4 silicon and its price dropped by $100. The 13-inch Macbook Air M4 starts at $999, and the 15-inch MacBook Air M4 starts at $1,199. Each provides a ton of value for the money. The larger Air is still thin and light while supplying a roomy 15.3-inch display. It’s the best laptop for most people. The smaller and lighter Air sacrifices some screen size for increased portability, making it the best student laptop.A Windows rival to the MacBook Air has arrived in the form of Microsoft\\'s first Copilot Plus PC. Based on a Qualcomm Snapdragon X CPU, the Surface Laptop 7 offers strong application and AI performance and outstanding battery life. It was the first Windows laptop I\\'ve tested with a longer runtime than that of the MacBook Air. With a design that\\'s on par with the Air\\'s, the Surface Laptop 7 is one of the best laptops. So is the Asus Zenbook A14, which is a lightweight laptop with an even longer runtime than the Surface Laptop 7.Read more:\\xa0How We Test ComputersBest VPN for Windows Best laptops of 2025Filter by Showing 6 of 6 Results Pros\\nOptimal balance of screen size and system weight\\nM4 processor provides good balance of performance and battery life\\nLower $1,199 starting price\\nCons\\n256GB SSD is too small for the price\\n$200 upcharge for more RAM or storage is steep\\nSmooth ProMotion display still exclusive to MacBook Pro\\nThe 15-inch MacBook Air is proof that you don\\'t need a Pro to get a larger display. It supplies a larger screen that you once found only on the pricier Pro models. If you\\'re eyeing the 14- or 16-inch Pro models primarily for the added screen size, the MacBook Air 15 is the more affordable option you should go for, especially at its new lower starting price.Why we like itThe roomy, 15.3-inch display is powered by Apple\\'s M4 chip and 16GB of RAM. The M4 update adds incremental improvements -- and a new sky blue color -- to an already fantastic laptop that sits in the Goldilocks Zone of Apple\\'s MacBook lineup.Who it\\'s best forPeople looking for a big-screen MacBook who don\\'t need the power of a MacBook Pro. With its roomy display, trim design and new lower starting price, the 15-inch M4 MacBook Air should be viewed as the default Air, with its cheaper and smaller 13-inch sibling a good alternative for students and others with tighter budgets and busy, on-the-go lifestyles.Who shouldn\\'t get itStudents who need a more affordable and portable laptop will be better off with the 13-inch Air. Creative types who need more graphics oomph will need to spend more for the added power of a MacBook Pro. \\xa0...

The 7441 model is Dell’s new Copilot Plus PC, which has an ARM-based Snapdragon X processor that allowed the laptop to last for more than 23 hours on our battery tests. That\\'s one of the longest laptop runtimes we have seen.Who it\\'s best forAnyone who is looking for a well-rounded, long-lasting laptop and doesn\\'t want to spend more than $1,000 on it. The 14-inch, 2.5K display makes the Inspiron 14 Plus a versatile machine, giving you enough screen space to be productive without feeling too cramped while also being compact enough for daily travel. With lengthy battery life, you can roam for long stretches between charges with the Inspiron 14 Plus.Who shouldn\\'t get itIf you aren\\'t ready to take the Windows-on-Arm plunge out of software compatibility fears, then you should skip this Snapdragon X-based Inspiron and pick out an Intel or AMD machine that runs on the x86 chip architecture. \\xa0...

In addition to a slight bump in performance over the previous generation, the M4 Air adds a Center Stage webcam, better support for external displays and a new ice blue color option.Who it\\'s best forThe M4 chip refresh adds up to a good, if minor, update to an already fantastic lightweight laptop that’s now more affordable for students and those on tight budgets. With its mix of strong overall performance, long battery life and a trim design, it’s no wonder it’s such a popular laptop for students.\\xa0 \\xa0...

Many x86 apps were unable to run on an Arm-based system. This time around, performance has improved and so has compatibility.\\xa0Why we like itWe like it for its polished design and class-leading battery life. The Surface Laptop 7 ran for nearly 20 hours in testing -- that’s the longest runtime of any 13- or 14-inch laptop we\\'ve ever reviewed -- including the M4 MacBook Air. The Surface Laptop 7 competes with the MacBook Air in performance and battery life and supplies a similarly sleek and solid build.Who it\\'s best forPeople who love the look and long battery life of the MacBook Air but want a Windows laptop. We wish there were an OLED display option, and you’ll need to do a compatibility check for your mission-critical applications before embracing the Arm-based Surface Laptop 7, but if you can get past those hurdles, then you’ll get a well-built, good-looking and long-running Windows ultraportable. You don\\'t necessarily need to spend the roughly $2,000 that our test system costs; one of the lower-priced configurations that starts at $900 should meet the needs of most people.Who shouldn\\'t get itAnyone worried about potential Windows-on-Arm compatibility issues should skip Qualcomm-based laptops and pick out an Intel or AMD model. The Surface Laptop 7 is also not the pick if you want an OLED display on your next laptop. \\xa0...

The Aspire 14 AI costs just $750 at Costco, making it the cheapest Copilot Plus PC we\\'ve reviewed.Why we like itThe Aspire 14 AI a great pick among budget laptops. Its performance and battery life exceed what you can expect for the price and the design is nearly the same as you get with Acer\\'s more expensive Swift models. You\\'re forced to sacrifice display quality to hit such a low price but that\\'s an item that\\'s usually not very high on a budget shopper\\'s priority list.

The Arm-based CPU delivers competitive performance and far fewer compatibility issues for mainstream use than previous Windows-on-Arm efforts. It helps that the Surface Pro 11 delivered a long runtime on our battery life test. The 13-inch OLED display supplies a crisp, 2.8K resolution along with P3 calibration and real HDR capability.Who it\\'s best forConvertible shoppers who want a detachable design and are willing to pay for it. The Surface Pro 11 starts at $1,000 but costs can quickly escalate. For example, the Flex keyboard with Slim pen adds a hefty $450 to our test system, which costs $1,700 for a Snapdragon Elite X processor, 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. It\\'s the best Surface Pro we’ve seen in a while but you also have to pay extra for a keyboard and stylus.Who shouldn\\'t get itIf you plan to use a two-in-one more in laptop mode than tablet mode, then a convertible model is better than a detachable setup like the Surface Pro 11. \\xa0...

This includes evaluating a device\\'s aesthetics, ergonomics and features with respect to price. A final review verdict is a combination of both objective and subjective judgments.\\xa0 We test all laptops with a core set of benchmarks, including\\xa0Primate Labs Geekbench 5 and 6,\\xa0Cinebench R23,\\xa0PCMark 10, a variety of\\xa03DMark\\xa0benchmarks (whichever can run on the laptop), UL Procyon Photo and Video (where supported) and our own battery life test.

We also place importance on how well they work given their cost and where the manufacturer has potentially made upgrades or tradeoffs for its price. The list of benchmarking software and comparison criteria we use changes over time as the devices we test evolve.

Amazon hasn\\'t yet released the specific dates for the summer shopping event, but has confirmed that Prime Day is coming in July.Other times of the year when you can find the best laptop deals are during back-to-school sales in late summer or early fall and a bit later in the year during Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales. You can find discounts on laptops throughout the year but, if you\\'re looking for the best deal and can afford to wait, these are typically the best times to buy one.Apple’s MacBooks are the most popular laptops and for good reason. They offer excellent build quality and leading performance and battery life ever since Apple introduced its M series processors in 2020.\\xa0The top two brands on the Windows side are Lenovo and HP. Both offer a wide variety of models, from thin-and-light ultraportables to larger, more powerful models for gaming content creation. Lenovo’s ThinkPads have long been a favorite among business laptops and its Yoga models are usually highly rated two-in-one laptops.\\xa0HP is in the middle of a branding transformation. It\\'s ended its Pavilion, Envy and Spectre laptop brands in favor of OmniBook consumer models and EliteBook business models. Its Omen brand will continue as the home for its gaming laptops. I liked the first OmniBook laptop I reviewed and look forward to testing more.For a budget laptop, Acer and Apple have great options -- each dominates our best budget laptop list. Acer makes great low-cost laptops and budget gaming laptops and Apple\\'s MacBook Air can usually be found for less than $1,000 where it\\'s a great deal. And the older M1 model costs even less.There are a ton of laptops on the market at any given moment and almost all of those models are available in multiple configurations to match your performance and budget needs. If you\\'re feeling overwhelmed with options when looking for a new laptop, it\\'s understandable. To help simplify things for you, here are the main things you should consider when you start looking.PriceThe search for a new laptop for most people starts with price. If the statistics that chipmaker Intel and PC manufacturers hurl at us are correct, you\\'ll be holding onto your next laptop for at least three years. If you can afford to stretch your budget a little to get better specs, do it. That stands whether you\\'re spending $500 or more than $1,000. In the past, you could get away with spending less upfront with an eye toward upgrading memory and storage in the future. Laptop makers are increasingly moving away from making components easily upgradable, so again, it\\'s best to get as much laptop as you can afford from the start.\\xa0Generally speaking, the more you spend, the better the laptop. That could mean better components for faster performance, a nicer display, sturdier build quality, a smaller or lighter design from higher-end materials or even a more comfortable keyboard. All of these things add to the cost of a laptop. I\\'d love to say $500 will get you a powerful gaming laptop, for example, but that\\'s not the case. Right now, the sweet spot for a reliable laptop that can handle average work, home office or school tasks is between $700 and $800 and a reasonable model for creative work or gaming is upward of about $1,000. The key is to look for discounts on models in all price ranges so you can get more laptop capabilities for less.\\xa0Operating systemChoosing an operating system is part personal preference and part budget. For the most part, Microsoft Windows and Apple\\'s MacOS do the same things (except for gaming, where Windows is the winner), but they do them differently. Unless there\\'s an OS-specific application you need, go with the one you feel most comfortable using. If you\\'re not sure which that is, head to an Apple store or a local electronics store and test them out. Or ask friends or family to let you test theirs for a bit. If you have an iPhone or iPad and like it, chances are you\\'ll like MacOS, too.\\xa0In price and variety (and PC gaming), Windows laptops win. If you want MacOS, you\\'re getting a MacBook. Apple\\'s MacBooks regularly top our best lists, the least expensive one is the M1 MacBook Air for $999. It is regularly discounted to $750 or $800, but if you want a cheaper MacBook, you\\'ll have to consider older refurbished ones.\\xa0Windows laptops can be found for as little as a couple of hundred dollars and come in all manner of sizes and designs. Granted, we\\'d be hard-pressed to find a $200 laptop we\\'d give a full-throated recommendation to but if you need a laptop for online shopping, email and word processing, they exist.\\xa0If you are on a tight budget, consider a Chromebook. ChromeOS is a different experience than Windows; make sure the applications you need have a Chrome, Android or Linux app before making the leap. If you spend most of your time roaming the web, writing, streaming video or using cloud-gaming services, they\\'re a good fit.\\xa0SizeRemember to consider whether having a lighter, thinner laptop or a touchscreen laptop with a good battery life will be important to you in the future. Size is primarily determined by the screen -- hello, laws of physics -- which in turn factors into battery size, laptop thickness, weight and price. Keep in mind other physics-related characteristics, such as an ultrathin laptop isn\\'t necessarily lighter than a thick one, you can\\'t expect a wide array of connections on a small or ultrathin model and so on.\\xa0ScreenWhen deciding on a screen, there are a myriad number of considerations: How much you need to display (which is surprisingly more about resolution than screen size), what types of content you\\'ll be looking at and whether you\\'ll be using it for gaming or creative work.You really want to optimize pixel density; that is, the number of pixels per inch the screen can display. Although other factors contribute to sharpness, a higher pixel density usually means a sharper rendering of text and interface elements. (You can easily calculate the pixel density of any screen at DPI Calculator if you don\\'t feel like doing the math, and you can also find out what math you need to do there.) I recommend a dot pitch of at least 100 pixels per inch as a rule of thumb.Because of the way Windows and MacOS scale for the display, you\\'re frequently better off with a higher resolution than you\\'d think. You can always make things bigger on a high-resolution screen, but you can never make them smaller -- to fit more content in the view -- on a low-resolution screen. This is why a 4K, 14-inch screen may sound like unnecessary overkill but may not be if you need to, say, view a wide spreadsheet.If you need a laptop with relatively accurate color that displays the most colors possible or that supports HDR, you can\\'t simply trust the specs -- not because manufacturers lie, but because they usually fail to provide the necessary context to understand what the specs they quote mean. You can find a ton of detail about considerations for different types of screen uses in our monitor buying guides for general purpose monitors, creators, gamers and HDR viewing.ProcessorThe processor, aka the CPU, is the brains of a laptop. Intel and AMD are the main CPU makers for Windows laptops, with Qualcomm as a new third option with its Arm-based Snapdragon X processors. Both Intel and AMD offer a staggering selection of mobile processors. Making things trickier, both manufacturers have chips designed for different laptop styles, like power-saving chips for ultraportables or faster processors for gaming laptops. Their naming conventions will let you know what type is used. You can head to Intel\\'s or AMD\\'s sites for explanations so you get the performance you want. Generally speaking, the faster the processor speed and the more cores it has, the better the performance will be.Apple makes its own chips for MacBooks, which makes things slightly more straightforward. Like Intel and AMD, you\\'ll still want to pay attention to the naming conventions to know what kind of performance to expect. Apple uses its M-series chipsets in Macs. The entry-level MacBook Air uses an M1 chip with an eight-core CPU and seven-core GPU. The current models have M2-series silicon that starts with an eight-core CPU and 10-core GPU and goes up to the M2 Max with a 12-core CPU and a 38-core GPU. Again, generally speaking, the more cores it has, the better the performance.\\xa0Battery life has less to do with the number of cores and more to do with CPU architecture, Arm versus x86. Apple’s Arm-based MacBooks and the first Arm-based Copilot Plus PCs we’ve tested offer better battery life than laptops based on x86 processors from Intel and AMD.GraphicsThe graphics processor handles all the work of driving the screen and generating what gets displayed, as well as speeding up a lot of graphics-related (and increasingly, AI-related) operations. For Windows laptops, there are two types of GPUs: integrated (iGPU) or discrete (dGPU). As the names imply, an iGPU is part of the CPU package, while a dGPU is a separate chip with dedicated memory (VRAM) that it communicates with directly, making it faster than sharing memory with the CPU.Because the iGPU splits space, memory and power with the CPU, it\\'s constrained by the limits of those. It allows for smaller, lighter laptops, but doesn\\'t perform nearly as well as a dGPU. There are some games and creative software that won\\'t run unless they detect a dGPU or sufficient VRAM. Most productivity software, video streaming, web browsing and other nonspecialized apps will run fine on an iGPU.For more power-hungry graphics needs, like video editing, gaming and streaming, design and so on, you\\'ll need a dGPU; there are only two real companies that make them, Nvidia and AMD, with Intel offering some based on the Xe-branded (or the older UHD Graphics branding) iGPU technology in its CPUs.MemoryFor memory, I highly recommend 16GB of RAM (8GB absolute minimum). RAM is where the operating system stores all the data for currently running applications and it can fill up fast. After that, it starts swapping between RAM and SSD, which is slower. A lot of sub-$500 laptops have 4GB or 8GB, which in conjunction with a slower disk can make for a frustratingly slow Windows laptop experience. Also, many laptops now have the memory soldered onto the motherboard. Most manufacturers disclose this but if the RAM type is LPDDR, assume it\\'s soldered and can\\'t be upgraded.\\xa0Some PC makers will solder memory on and also leave an empty internal slot for adding a stick of RAM. You may need to contact the laptop manufacturer or find the laptop\\'s full specs online to confirm. Check the web for user experiences because the slot may still be hard to get to, it may require nonstandard or hard-to-get memory or other pitfalls.StorageYou\\'ll still find cheaper hard drives in budget laptops and larger hard drives in gaming laptops but faster solid-state drives have all but replaced hard drives in laptops. They can make a big difference in performance. Not all SSDs are equally speedy, and cheaper laptops typically have slower drives; if the laptop only has 4GB or 8GB of RAM, it may end up swapping to that drive and the system may slow down quickly while you\\'re working.\\xa0Get what you can afford and if you need to go with a smaller drive, you can always add an external drive or two down the road or use cloud storage to bolster a small internal drive. The one exception is gaming laptops: I don\\'t recommend going with less than a 512GB SSD unless you really like uninstalling games every time you want to play a new game.\\xa0Judging from the current selections on our list, I recommend spending $600 or more for a midrange laptop and at least $1,000 and probably closer to $2,000 on a gaming laptop. We’ve already seen price hikes on many laptop models since the Trump tariffs began earlier this year. Acer\\'s Jason Chen said in February that the company would raise its prices by 10% in anticipation. \"We will have to adjust the end user price to reflect the tariff,\" the CEO of the Taiwan-based company said. The Trump administration has eased up somewhat on its tariffs against China, dropping the overall rates from 145% to 30% for 90 days, while trade negotiations continue. While this temporary cut may help prevent further price increases, I haven’t seen any price reductions outside of sales. And if you are patient, you can usually find the model you want on sale. Laptop vendors and online retailers are constantly rotating sales so it pays to keep an eye on pricing and buy during a dip. During the summer, check out laptop sales for dads and grads and then back-to-school sales.Deciding between MacOS and Windows laptops for many people will come down to personal preference and budget. Apple\\'s base model laptop, the M1 MacBook Air, starts at $999. You can sometimes find it discounted or you can get educational pricing from Apple and other retailers. In general, it\\'ll be at least $1,000 for a new MacBook and the prices just go up from there.\\xa0For the money, you\\'re getting great hardware top to bottom, inside and out. Apple recently moved to using its own processors, which resulted in\\xa0across-the-board performance improvements\\xa0compared to older Intel-based models. The company\\'s most powerful laptop, the 16-inch MacBook Pro, still hasn\\'t been updated to Apple silicon.\\xa0Again, that great hardware comes at a price. Also, you\\'re limited to just Apple laptops. With Windows and Chromebooks (more on these below), you get an amazing variety of devices at a range of prices.\\xa0Software between the two is plentiful so unless you need to run something that\\'s only available on one platform or the other, you should be fine to go with either. Gaming is definitely an advantage for a Windows laptop.MacOS is also considered to be easier and safer to use than Windows, especially for people who want their computers to get out of the way so they can get things done. Over the years, Microsoft has done its best to follow suit and, with\\xa0Windows 11 here,\\xa0it\\'s trying to remove any barriers. Also, while Macs might have a reputation for being safer, with the popularity of the iPhone and iPad helping to drive Mac sales,\\xa0they\\'ve become bigger targets for malware.If you plan to travel with your laptop, whether across campus or the country, a good laptop backpack is essential. There are a lot of subpar backpacks out there, so check our best laptop backpacks list for our recommendations based on hours and hours of testing.\\xa0And for when you aren’t on the move but at your desk and ready to work, a laptop cooling pad can help your laptop run smoothly. From gaming and video editing to just having dozens of Chrome tabs open, there are times when your laptop needs some help to stay cool and maintain full\\xa0 performance. Our sister site ZDNet has a good list of the best laptop cooling pads. Yes, they are, but they\\'re not for everyone.\\xa0Google\\'s Chrome OS has come a long way in the 10-plus years\\xa0since they arrived and Chromebooks -- laptops that run on Chrome OS -- are great for people who do most of their work in a web browser or using mobile apps. They are secure, simple and, more often than not, a bargain. What they can\\'t do is natively run Windows or Mac software.\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

I can\\'t think of anyone better equipped to deliver honest commentary.\\xa0Alright, are you back with me? Because, shock of shocks, Jean-Pierre and the Biden White House have already been caught in a lie surrounding her new book.\\xa0According to Politico, a New York-based publicist named Gilda Squire was \"informally\" working with the then-press secretary as early as 2023. That included Squire being copied onto official emails, a move that raised eyebrows among some staffers. In February 2024, Axios\\' Alex Thompson asked about the allegations of impropriety and was told they were \"unequivocally untrue.\"\\nThompson has now burned his source over the revealed falsehood.\\xa0— Alex Thompson (@AlexThomp) June 4, 2025When Thompson reached out to Squire to tell her he was going to use the above emails, she played the victim, berating him for writing to her in such a \"tone.\" She then claimed she didn\\'t start working with Jean-Pierre \"professionally\" until after the latter left the White House. Yet, the allegation was that they were working together informally, so that\\'s essentially an admission without an admission.\\xa0To back that up, Thompson then posted another email showing Squire being \"looped in\" on official correspondence in the Fall of 2023.\\xa0But here is one such internal WH email with Gilda being looped in with deputy press secretary Emilie Simons on Karine Jean Pierre’s fall 2023 Vogue profile.(I have more but to give you an idea). pic.twitter.com/mKMKNvTcMF— Alex Thompson (@AlexThomp) June 4, 2025So yeah, I don\\'t think Jean-Pierre and Gilda Squire are the right people to be lecturing anyone on \"disinformation and misinformation.\" This attempt at a tiger changing its stripes is brazenly ridiculous. Anyone who helped cover for Biden\\'s condition has no business doing anything but leaving the spotlight in shame. Unfortunately, Jean-Pierre will probably have an MSNBC show by the end of the year.\\nEditor’s Note: Every single day, here at RedState, we will stand up and fight against the radical left and deliver the conservative reporting our readers deserve.Help us continue to tell the truth.

Park allegedly provided materials for explosives to the person who carried out the bombing, which officials have described as the largest incident of its kind in southern California. Authorities believe the bomber died in the blast.The attack on the fertility clinic was carried out by Guy Edward Bartkus, who was also killed in the explosion, according to the FBI. Officials allege that Park shipped more than 180lbs of ammonium nitrate, a chemical compound commonly used as fertilizer but also used for explosives, to Bartkus before the attack.Authorities have described Bartkus as a member of the anti-natalist movement, a fringe group that opposes childbirth and population growth and believes people should not continue to procreate. Officials said he intentionally targeted the fertility clinic as an act of terrorism. He tried to livestream the explosion, but the attempt failed, the FBI says.The blast gutted the American Reproductive Centers fertility clinic in Palms Springs and shattered the windows of nearby buildings along a palm tree-lined street. Witnesses described a loud boom followed by a chaotic scene, with people screaming in terror and glass strewn along the sidewalk and street. A body was found near a charred vehicle outside the clinic.Investigators have not said if he intended to kill himself in the attack or why he chose the specific facility. The clinic he attacked provides services to help people get pregnant, including in vitro fertilization and fertility evaluations.Officials with the FBI and the US attorney’s office said on Wednesday that they believe Bartkus and Park shared anti-natalist views and that Park had visited Bartkus for several weeks earlier this year, during which time investigators believe they conducted experiments related to the bomb.Authorities executed a search warrant in Bartkus’s home town of Twentynine Palms, a city of 28,000 residents north-east of Palm Springs with a large US Marine Corps base. Officials had also executed a warrant at Park’s residence in Seattle, where they found “an explosive recipe that was similar to the Oklahoma City bombing”, said Akil Davis, the FBI assistant director in charge, on Wednesday.Park traveled to Poland days after the bombing but was removed from the country on Tuesday and deported back to the US, where he was arrested. He is expected to be transported to California in the coming weeks, Essayli said.A senior FBI official called the explosion possibly the “largest bombing scene that we’ve had in southern California”.Scott Sweetow, a retired ATF explosives expert, said the amount of damage caused indicated that the suspect used a “high explosive” similar to dynamite and TNT rather than a “low explosive” like gun powder.Those types of explosives are normally difficult for civilians to access, but increasingly people are finding ways to concoct explosives at home, he said.“Once you know the chemistry involved, it’s pretty easy to get stuff,” Sweetow said. “The ingredients you could get at a grocery store.”The images of the aftermath also showed that the explosion appeared to blow from the street straight through the building and to the parking lot on the other side, something that could have been intentional or pure luck, Sweetow said. A part of the car was also blown through the building and landed in the back by a dumpster.\\n```\\n\\n## [FBI arrests a man in New York linked to explosion at a California fertility clinic, officials say](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/fbi-arrests-man-new-york-linked-explosion-california-122489401) (#102456)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 14:54:19+00:00\\n\\n```\\nThree law enforcement officials say the FBI has made an arrest in New York in connection with an explosion of a Palm Springs, California fertility clinicByERIC TUCKER Associated Press and JAKE OFFENHARTZ Associated PressJune 4, 2025, 10:21 AMNEW YORK -- The FBI has made an arrest in New York in connection with last month\\'s explosion of a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, three law enforcement officials said Wednesday. Federal prosecutors are expected to release details at a news conference in Los Angeles.The arrest, first reported by NBC News, took place Tuesday evening at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York, according to the officials. One official identified the suspect as Daniel Park, 32, of Kent, Washington.Investigators believe the bomber died in the blast. It was not immediately clear what Park was charged with or how he was connected to the investigation.The law enforcement officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss a criminal case that has not been publicly disclosed.The FBI has identified Guy Edward Bartkus as the suspect in the apparent car bomb detonation, and investigators say he had nihilistic and “anti-pro-life” writings. A body was found near a charred vehicle outside the clinic.Officials said at the time they were investigating whether Bartkus had any help. He attempted to livestream the explosion and left behind writings that were still being examined to determine his state of mind, the FBI said. The blast gutted the American Reproductive Centers fertility clinic in Palms Springs and shattered the windows of nearby buildings along a palm tree-lined street. Witnesses described a loud boom followed by a chaotic scene, with people screaming in terror and glass strewn along the sidewalk and street.A senior FBI official called the explosion possibly the “largest bombing scene that we’ve had in Southern California.”\\n```\\n\\n## [Man charged in Palm Springs fertility clinic bombing after being arrested by FBI at New York\\'s JFK airport](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/palm-springs-bombing-arrest-jfk-airport/) (#103031)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 17:32:47+00:00\\n\\n```\\nBy\\nAndres Triay,\\nRichard Esposito,\\nAndres Gutierrez,\\nAlex Sundby\\nSenior Editor\\nAlex Sundby is a senior editor at CBSNews.com.

Kennedy International Airport in New York City overnight and charged in connection with last month\\'s bombing outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, authorities announced Wednesday.Daniel Park of Washington state was charged with providing and attempting to provide material support to a terrorist, U.S. Attorney Bilal Essayli announced during a news conference.\\nPark is accused of shipping approximately 180 pounds of ammonium nitrate to the bomber, who was identified by officials as 25-year-old Guy Bartkus, Essayli said. Ammonium nitrate is commonly used as a precursor to construct homemade bombs. The U.S. attorney said Park shares Bartkus\\' extremist beliefs.Bartkus stated in writings or recordings that he was against bringing people into the world against their will, according to law enforcement sources familiar with the investigation.Park paid for an additional 90 pounds of ammonium nitrate that was shipped to Bartkus in the days leading up to the May 17 bombing, Essayli said.Park spent approximately two weeks visiting Bartkus\\' residence in Twentynine Palms, California, in late January and early February and ran \"experiments\" in his garage, Essayli said.Park is scheduled to appear in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, Wednesday afternoon. He is expected to be prosecuted in Los Angeles.Park, a U.S. citizen, was apprehended in Poland and arrived at Kennedy airport overnight, according to two senior U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the investigation. Four Polish border guards were with him, and two members of the FBI flying squad were also on the flight. Park consented to speak with the FBI at JFK and was interviewed by them there.\\nPolish authorities detained Park at the request of U.S. officials, according to a law enforcement source.Bartkus died in the blast. Four other people were injured in the explosion. Police in Palm Springs said the bomber backed his Ford Fusion into a parking spot outside the clinic before the powerful explosion left a crater on the morning of May 17. The explosion could be felt more than a mile away from the blast zone, the FBI said.The vehicle exploded outside American Reproductive Centers, a fertility clinic with a full-service IVF lab that dd not perform abortions. The blast caused significant damage to the building. The facility also lost power, but it was restored in time so no embryos were lost in the attack. The clinic reopened about two weeks later at a new location.The FBI believed that the bombing was premeditated and called the attack an \"intentional act of terrorism.\"\\nDetectives said they believed Bartkus acted alone at the site of the attack, but said they were scouring his online chats to learn whether anyone helped him buy parts or refine the design of the bomb.Investigators said the blast pattern shows that the device was far more damaging than a low-grade explosive such as fireworks.The FBI said Bartkus had access to a large quantity of commercially available chemical products that could be combined to create a homemade explosive device.The FBI and other law enforcement personnel gather evidence a day after a bomb exploded near a reproductive health facility in Palm Springs, California, May 18, 2025.\\nReuters/David Swanson\\nTwentynine Palms is home to a large Marine Corps base about an hour\\'s drive from Palm Springs.\\nAnna Schecter\\ncontributed to this report.\\nJohn F.

(DOJ/Getty))But critics blasted Biden for some of the pardons and preemptive pardons for members of his family, inner circle and some allies, amid concerns that the Trump administration would investigate and attempt to punish their actions.\\xa0WHAT IS AN AUTOPEN? THE SIGNING DEVICE AT THE HEART OF TRUMP\\'S ATTACKS ON BIDEN PARDONSBiden signed the pardon for his son Hunter by hand. But the others appear to have been signed by autopen.\\xa0Here is a list of the former president’s most controversial pardons:\\xa0Hunter Biden\\xa0Former President Joe Biden pardoned his son Hunter in December 2024 — after vowing to the American people for months that he would not do so.\\xa0Hunter Biden was found guilty of three felony firearm offenses stemming from Special Counsel David Weiss’ investigation. The first son also was charged with federal tax crimes regarding the failure to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes.\\xa0Before his trial, Hunter Biden entered a surprise guilty plea.\\xa0Then-President Joe Biden, in December 2024, announced a blanket pardon that applies to any offenses against the U.S. that Hunter Biden \"has committed or may have committed\" from Jan. 1, 2014, to Dec. 1, 2024.\\xa0HUNTER BIDEN: A LOOK AT HOW THE SAGA SPANNING OVER SIX YEARS UNFOLDED Hunter Biden was found guilty of three felony firearm offenses stemming from Special Counsel David Weiss’ investigation.\\xa0 (Jose Luis Magana/The Associated Press)\"From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department’s decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted,\" former President Joe Biden said. \"There has been an effort to break Hunter — who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter, they’ve tried to break me — and there’s no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough.\"The then-president added, \"I\\xa0hope Americans will understand why a father and a president would come to this decision.\"\\xa0Biden family members\\xa0Just a day before leaving office on Jan. 20, 2025, then-President Joe Biden signed an executive grant of clemency for his brother James and his brother\\'s wife, Sarah Jones Biden; his sister, Valerie Biden Owens, and her husband, John T. Owens; and his brother Francis W. Biden.\\xa0The \"full and unconditional\" preemptive pardon for his family members covered \"any nonviolent offenses against the United States which they may have committed or taken part in during the period from Jan. 1, 2014, through the date of this pardon,\" which was signed Jan. 19.\\xa0The pardon appears to have been signed with an autopen.\\xa0Members of the Biden family had fallen at the center of the congressional investigation into their business dealings.\\xa0The House of Representatives launched an impeachment inquiry against Biden, finding that Biden committed \"impeachable conduct\" during his time as vice president and \"defrauded the United States to enrich his family.\"\\xa0PRESIDENT BIDEN PARDONS HIS SIBLINGS JUST MINUTES BEFORE LEAVING OFFICEDuring the inquiry, congressional investigators heard testimony from James Biden, who ultimately was referred to the Justice Department for prosecution for making false statements to Congress about \"key aspects\" of the impeachment inquiry.\\xa0The House of Representatives found that the Biden family and its associates had received more than $27 million from foreign individuals or entities since 2014.They also alleged that the Biden family leveraged Biden’s position as vice president to obtain more than $8 million in loans from Democrat benefactors. The loans \"have not been repaid and the paperwork supporting many of the loans does not exist and has not been produced to the committees.\"The Republicans said the alleged conspiracy took place while Biden was serving as vice president.Gen. Mark MilleyThen-President Joe Biden, on Jan. 19, pardoned then-Gen. Mark Milley, after the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal in 2021.\\xa0Milley, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has admitted the withdrawal, where 13 U.S. troops lost their lives, was a \"strategic failure.\"\\xa0\\xa0BIDEN COMMITTED ‘IMPEACHABLE CONDUCT,’ ‘DEFRAUDED UNITED STATES TO ENRICH HIS FAMILY’: HOUSE GOP REPORT\"My family and I are deeply grateful for the President’s action today,\" Milley said in a statement, accepting the pardon. \"After forty-three years of faithful service in uniform to our Nation, protecting and defending the Constitution, I do not wish to spend whatever remaining time the Lord grants me fighting those who unjustly might seek retribution for perceived slights.\"\\xa0The pardon appears to have been signed with autopen.\\xa0Dr. Anthony Fauci\\xa0Then-President Joe Biden, also on Jan. 19, 2025, pardoned former Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\\xa0Dr. Anthony Fauci. Fauci also served as Biden’s chief medical advisor and oversaw the U.S. public health response and research on the COVID-19 virus and vaccine development.\\xa0Fauci accepted the pardon in a statement shortly after Biden announced the move, claiming he was subject to \"politically motivated threats of investigation and prosecution.\"DR. FAUCI SAYS HE APPRECIATES PRESIDENT BIDEN\\'S PARDON BUT INSISTS \\'NO CRIME\\' WAS COMMITTED\"Let me be perfectly clear: I have committed no crime and there are no possible grounds for any allegation or threat of criminal investigation or prosecution of me,\" Fauci said. \"The fact is, however, that the mere articulation of these baseless threats, and the potential that they will be acted upon, create immeasurable and intolerable distress for me and my family. For these reasons, I acknowledge and appreciate the action that President Biden has taken today on my behalf.\"\\xa0Fauci’s pardon also appears to have been signed with autopen.\\xa0Members of House Select Committee to investigate Jan. 6\\xa0Former President Joe Biden, also on Jan. 19, 2025, used autopen to sign a pardon for members of Congress who served on the House Select Committee to investigate the Jan. 6, 2021, riot on the United States Capitol.\\xa0BIDEN PARDONS MARK MILLEY, ANTHONY FAUCI, J6 COMMITTEE MEMBERSThe pardon also covered committee staff and the police officers from the D.C.

Trump frequently uses Biden as a political foil and has sought to undo a number of policies from his predecessor\\'s administration since he returned to office. The announcement Wednesday directs the White House counsel and Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate whether anyone \"conspired to deceive the public about Biden\\'s mental state and unconstitutionally exercise the authorities and responsibilities of the President.\" It is an escalation of an issue that Trump and his allies have frequently raised, possibly paving the way for Republicans to argue that many of Biden’s actions as president were invalid.\"This conspiracy marks one of the most dangerous and concerning scandals in American history,\" Trump wrote in a memo. \"The American public was purposefully shielded from discovering who wielded the executive power, all while Biden’s signature was deployed across thousands of documents to effect radical policy shifts.\"Trump has acknowledged using the autopen himself in office. In March, he said he turned to it “only for very unimportant papers,” such as responses to letters.“But to use them for — for what they’ve used them for is terrible,” he added, referring to the Biden administration. In Wednesday\\'s memo, Trump further contended that if Biden’s aides “secretly” used the pen to conceal his alleged decline while they were taking executive actions in his stead, “that would constitute an unconstitutional wielding of the power of the Presidency, a circumstance that would have implications for the legality and validity of numerous executive actions undertaken in Biden’s name.”Biden defended his record in a statement Wednesday, arguing that the probe was a “distraction” from Trump and Republican lawmakers.“Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn’t is ridiculous and false,” Biden said. Trump has previously claimed without evidence that Biden used an autopen to sign pre-emptive pardons for the members of Congress who investigated the events surrounding the Jan. 6, 2021, attack at the U.S. Capitol, rendering them “void.”Autopens have long been a mechanical tool to reproduce signatures in the White House, with Barack Obama being the first president to use it to sign legislation, according to The Associated Press. Previous administrations have pointed to a 2005 Office of Legal Counsel memo stating that the president “need not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill he approves and decides to sign in order for the bill to become law.” Biden has frequently defended himself against claims about his mental fitness and memory.Former special counsel Robert Hur said in a report last year that Biden would probably present to a jury as a \"sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory\" in explaining his decision not to prosecute Biden after an investigation of his handling of classified documents.Biden rejected Hur\\'s claims about his memory shortly after the report was released last year, saying, \"My memory’s fine.\"In an interview with ABC’s “The View” in May, Biden again denied having suffered from mental decline when he was president.“They are wrong,” he said of the allegations.House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., is also investigating Biden and has asked several former White House aides to appear for transcribed interviews.Elyse Perlmutter-GumbinerElyse Perlmutter-Gumbiner is the coordinating producer for the NBC News White House unit.Zoë RichardsZoë Richards is a politics reporter for NBC News.Kelly O\\'Donnell contributed.\\n```\\n\\n## [House expands probe of Biden\\'s cognitive decline, autopen; readies subpoenas](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/jun/4/house-expands-probe-bidens-cognitive-decline-autopen-readies/) (#108325)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 17:05:00+00:00\\n\\n```\\nGOP lawmakers on Wednesday accelerated an investigation of ex-Biden administration aides who covered up the former president’s cognitive decline and may have acted on his behalf using the presidential autopen.\\nThe Republican-led House Oversight and Government Reform Committee sent a letter to one of Joseph R. Biden’s longest-serving aides, former senior adviser Mike Donilon, seeking a transcribed interview about reports that he worked to conceal Mr. Biden’s inability to carry out the duties of the presidency while stepping in on decision-making and other matters before cashing in as a campaign aide.\\nThe panel sent letters seeking interviews to three other former aides: chief of staff Ron Klain, communications senior adviser Anita Dunn, deputy chief of staff Bruce Reed and counselor to the president Steve Ricchetti.\\nThe request expands the investigation to nine people who worked closely with Mr. Biden and reportedly played a role in filling in the gaps in his presidency that grew wider as his cognitive decline accelerated.\\nThe panel last month requested interviews with former White House physician and close family friend Kevin O’Connor and three top aides: Annie Tomasini, Anthony Bernal and Ashley Williams. If they don’t respond to interview dates set to be released this week, committee Chairman James Comer said he’ll subpoena all of them.\\nThe oversight panel is examining whether top aides not only “ran interference” for the former president, but also whether they approved on Mr. Biden’s behalf sweeping pardons for his family and Democrat allies as well as thousands of pardons and commutations to convicted felons, including individuals who killed children and police officers.\\nThe announcement comes a day after the Justice Department’s pardon attorney, Ed Martin, said he’s investigating the Biden administration’s use of the autopen to pardon and commute the sentences of thousands of people.\\nMr. Biden left office at age 82, and a series of books and news articles based on interviews with former White House staffers paint the former president as a mentally and physically frail old man who wasn’t up to the task of running the country.\\n“The cover-up of President Biden’s mental decline is one of the greatest scandals in our nation’s history. These five former senior advisers were eyewitnesses to President Biden’s condition and operations within the Biden White House. They must appear before the House Oversight Committee and provide truthful answers about President Biden’s cognitive state and who was calling the shots,” Mr. Comer, Kentucky Republican, said.\\nIn a statement announcing the expanded probe, Mr. Comer cites the latest Biden presidency tell-all, written by CNN anchor Jake Tapper and correspondent Alex Thompson, which describes the recollections of dozens of mostly anonymous former Biden aides.\\n“Five people were running the country, and Joe Biden was at best a senior member of the board,” one aide recalls, according to the book.\\nMr. Klain was considered by many to have been a uniquely powerful chief of staff who helped drive decision-making on a daily basis before he left the job in early 2023.\\nMr. Donilon, a Biden aide and ally for four decades, was reportedly among those who rejected internal recommendations that Mr. Biden forgo running for a second term. Mr. Donilon then left the White House to serve as a senior adviser to the Biden 2024 campaign, earning a $4 million paycheck.\\nIn a May appearance on the daytime talk show “The View,” Mr. Biden denied the bombshell claims made in the book by Mr. Tapper and Mr. Thompson that claimed he was too incoherent to run the country.\\n“They are wrong. There is nothing to sustain that,” Mr. Biden said.\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

And tram-trains will soon be on their way to parts of the region, travelling along Metrolink lines AND and rail tracks.Keir Starmer: \\'We\\'re putting the power in Greater Manchester\\'s hands - use this money to grow\\'“This is a gamechanging moment that will underpin Greater Manchester’s green growth for years to come,\" mayor Andy Burnham said.Article continues below\"Building on our strong track record, we can now move at pace to deliver the next phase of the Bee Network – creating the UK’s first fully electric, zero emission integrated public transport system by 2030,” said mayor Andy Burnham.“With a pipeline of major transport projects better connecting our towns and cities, and local rail lines brought into the Bee Network, our communities will be the first outside London to be served by fully joined-up bike, bus, tram and train travel.(Image: Kenny Brown | Manchester Evening News)“Greater Manchester has had a decade of growth faster than the UK average. This funding – together with our devolved decision-making powers – can be .\"It’s a major boost for our own plans to deliver £10bn of investment over the next 10 years, build thousands of new homes, create skilled jobs, and open up new opportunities right across our city-region.”Writing exclusively for the Manchester Evening News, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: \"For too long, the mindset of previous governments has been to hoard power and potential behind the walls of Westminster. The result? Proud places across the country have been neglected and left behind.\\'A gamechanging moment\\'(Image: Manchester Evening News)\"We’re ending that. Today we are announcing £15.6bn in funding for local transport projects in England’s city regions. That’s the biggest ever cash boost for local transport in England.\"What does that mean for Greater Manchester? To put it simply, we’re putting in £2.5bn to transform public transport. That means the mayor can grow the Metrolink tram network.\"There’ll be new stops in Bury, North Manchester and Oldham and extending the tram to Stockport town centre. And it will provide funding to move to a fully electrified bus fleet by 2030, future proofing bus travel and making journeys and travelling around the Greater Manchester area better for passengers.(Image: Keith Rylance)\"All of this will create jobs. It will improve people’s commutes. It will mean bigger labour markets for employers and more opportunity for workers. And it will mean a better connected city for you to live, work in and visit.\"No timescales have been given for when construction work will start, let alone when the new facilities will open, but the funding covers 2027 to 2032. Plans are expected to advance in the coming years.The new tram stop in Sandhills will form part of Manchester’s £3.8bn Victoria North project, a ‘new town’ of 15,000 homes that will be built across 155 hectares from Angel Meadow in the city centre to Collyhurst in north Manchester.It takes its name from the Sandhills park and former quarry, and would sit between Victoria and Queens Road stations, one of the longest gaps between Metrolink halts.A similar line of thinking is employed for the new Elton Reservoir stop, falling between Radcliffe and Bury.And Burnham(Image: PA)It’s part of a project to build 3,500 homes on formerly green belt land around the new park and ride station, which will also ‘increase the attractiveness of the reservoir as a leisure destination and provide better access to greenspace in the south of Bury’, the borough’s transport strategy said.A new station on Cop Road, in Oldham, would be built between the Derker station and Shaw and Crompton stop, and like Elton Reservoir is identified as a priority in Andy Burnham’s controversial Places for Everyone plan with 1,450 homes eyed for the location.Tram-trains are also also set to come to Oldham, as TfGM added it will roll-out the hybrid services to the borough along with Rochdale, Heywood, and Bury. The tech sees services run on traditional tramlines for some parts of the network, but on railway lines using batteries for others.Few details have been released on the Stockport extension’s route, but previously TfGM chiefs said its bus interchange was built so it can link up to a new tram line.It’s thought the line could extend from the existing terminus at East Didsbury. Publicly-available maps of railway lines show there is the dormant Manchester South District Railway, which runs from the end of the in-use East Didsbury tram line.Should trams follow the old rail line, they would then run through Heaton Mersey, but require a new spur crossing the M60 motorway and West Coast Mainline to reach the ‘tram capable’ town centre interchange.The 1,000 new electric Bee Network buses are set to be purchased by 2030, meaning Greater Manchester’s transport network should be carbon neutral by the end of the decade.Article continues belowThose buses could stop at a new Leigh interchange, with regular V1 passengers also set to hop off at a new ‘central Manchester transport interchange’, details of which have yet to be confirmed.\\n```\\n\\n## [The Mancunian Way: (Finally) stopping at Stockport](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/mancunian-way-finally-stopping-stockport-31787507) (#100511)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 15:30:00+00:00\\n\\n```\\n£2.5billion cash boost set to deliver new tram stops, more electric buses, tram-trains and new interchanges16:30, 04 Jun 2025Hello,The Metrolink is coming to Stockport. Yes really.Stopfordians have been banging on about this for years and although various promises were made, it was never a sure fire thing.\\u200cBut now it’s actually happening thanks to a bumper transport deal for Greater Manchester worth £2.5bn over the next seven years.\\u200cIt’s part and parcel of a package that will include new tram stops in Manchester, Bury and Oldham, 1,000 more electric Bee buses, tram-trains and new interchanges.Three stops on existing tram lines at Sandhills in north Manchester; Elton Reservoir in Bury; and Cop Road in Oldham are among the details. And there are plans for new city centre and Leigh interchanges and tram-trains travelling along Metrolink lines and rail tracks.Article continues belowLocal democracy reporter Ethan Davies has the full details here, though he says no timescales have been given for when construction work will start.Andy Burnham has promised the UK’s first fully electric, zero emission integrated public transport system by 2030. It’s a tall order, but he seems confident it’s a goal the region can hit given this ‘major’ boost from central government.“With a pipeline of major transport projects better connecting our towns and cities, and local rail lines brought into the Bee Network, our communities will be the first outside London to be served by fully joined-up bike, bus, tram and train travel,” he enthused.\\u200cPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says £2.5bn to transform public transport in Greater Manchester is ‘putting the power back in Greater Manchester’s hands’. That piles the pressure on Andy Burnham - but it’s what he’s been campaigning for.\"All of this will create jobs. It will improve people’s commutes. It will mean bigger labour markets for employers and more opportunity for workers. And it will mean a better connected city for you to live, work in and visit,” Sir Keir says in an exclusive piece for the Manchester Evening News.\\u200cSo what does this all mean for Greater Mancunians? Ethan has been telling me why this is such a ‘gamechanging’ moment for the Bee Network.Why is this so exciting for Stopfordians?“If you look at Cornbrook - nobody lived there in the 1990s, then they put a tram stop in there and in the last 15 years we’ve started seeing housing developments opening up.“Stockport has done it the other way around. There’s been a lot of development recently.\\u200c“But I think Stockport will become more metropolitan. It solidifies this idea that Greater Manchester wants new housing around major transport hubs.”The interchange, seen here under construction, has a park on top, and was designed for trams to run there(Image: DMW Droneography)Where will it stop?“It will be an extension of the East Didsbury line and looks likely to go to the new interchange.\\u200c“We don’t know when it will happen but the money covers 2027/2032.”And when will it happen?“Andy Burnham will want building work to start by the end of his mayoral term. But there has been a big delay due to Labour’s review. So we’ll see if that delays building work.“Transport for Greater Manchester is still working out the finer details but they are a lot further on with plans for Stockport because they have been working on this for years.”\\u200c(Image: Kenny Brown | Manchester Evening News)Mr Burnham told our Politics Editor Joseph Timan today: \"We\\'re going to have to stack up the business case, we\\'re going to still have to get that through the Treasury, the precise funding package.\"I would be disappointed if we do not have building work starting let\\'s say within the Parliament, maybe within the mayoral term, but certainly within the Parliament, I would want to see work starting on that tram extension to Stockport.\"\\u200cMore on where the tram might stop here.What about the railways?It seems plans for a new railway line between Manchester and Liverpool are \\'set to go ahead\\'.But Chancellor Rachel Reeves refused to commit to the project when she visited Rochdale this morning. Instead she promised there is ‘more to come’ in the spending review next week.\\u200cChancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves delivers a speech during a visit to Mellor Bus in Rochdale, Greater Manchester.(Image: Peter Byrne/PA Wire)The £2.5bn financial package for transport announced today was first promised by ex-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to replace the northern leg of HS2 in late 2023. But it was placed under review shortly after Labour came to power last summer. It’s understood local leaders were concerned the cash could have been cut by the Chancellor.So Mr Burnham was full of beans when he welcomed Ms Reeves to Rochdale and heralded what could be ‘Greater Manchester\\'s best decade since the Victorian era’.\\u200cYou can read Jo’s piece on the Chancellor’s announcement here.WeatherThursday: Heavy rain changing to sunny intervals in the afternoon. 17C.Roads: A572 St Helens Road southbound, Leigh, closed due to roadworks from A578 Twist Lane to Bonnywell Road.

Fast rail from Liverpool to Hull, HS2 to Manchester and Leeds. Even at one point, a tunnel through the Pennines. Northern Powerhouse. Levelling Up.All promised. None delivered.This time, she says it will be different, announcing £15.6billion of investment into city transport in the North and Midlands.Buses, trams, new stations; £2.5billion for Greater Manchester and new tram stops in Bury, Oldham, and the tram to reach Stockport.On the other side of the Pennines, £2.1billion to start building West Yorkshire Mass Transit by 2028. And more projects from Tyne and Wear to Birmingham.At a bus manufacturer in Rochdale, Reeves announced that the Government is “committed to growth everywhere”, and that the Treasury’s Green Book rules were being torn up (which tend to favour the capital and South East).Katherine Forster quizzed Andy Burnham in Rochdale over Britain\\'s broken transport networkGB NewsNext week’s Spending Review will bring hard choices, as increased defence spending and global uncertainty over trade make Reeves’s task all the harder.Real-terms cuts are coming. And tax rises are likely.So the Government yesterday was trying to get on the front foot. And Labour have been bruised by its drubbing in the local elections last month. Many of their own MPs, fearful of losing their seats after just one term, have been pushing for spending in the North.Back in January, Reeves announced an infrastructure splurge, which focused on London and the South East.They seem to have learnt some lessons from that. But is yesterday\\'s announcement all it’s cracked up to be?Rachel Reeves delivers a speech during a visit to Mellor Bus in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, to announce a multi-billion-pound boost for city transport in the North and the MidlandsPAThe Conservatives have accused Labour of “copying and pasting” their old pledges. And it’s true that there are striking similarities with promises made by Rishi Sunak to the North when he stood in a former railway station in Manchester back in 2023 and ditched the last remaining Northern leg of HS2.And, the announcements were of funding for mayoralty regions. So questions about rail links between Northern cities went unanswered.Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham introduced the Chancellor. He was upbeat when I talked to him for GB News.He told me: “I\\'m confident, because people can see the change that we\\'re already making. So, this isn\\'t sort of pie in the sky or it\\'ll happen one day. We\\'re doing it.” Andy Burnham introduced the Chancellor at the eventPAHe pledges “the best integrated public transport system outside of London by the end of the decade” and with “the lowest fares possible”.But on rail, he adds: “As good as today\\'s news was, I will not be letting the Chancellor or the Government off the hook. Because when it comes to rail travel between the big cities of the north, it\\'s nowhere near good enough. “And the point I keep making is, why should people here be treated as second-class citizens when it comes to rail travel? Why should people lose half a morning if they\\'re trying to go between Manchester and Leeds? They shouldn\\'t. And we\\'ve had to put up with that for far too long.”He and Liverpool Mayor Steve Rotherham are pushing for “an Elizabeth line for the north west between Liverpool and Manchester with five stops. No more. That would be a new spine for the public transport system in the north west of England.”The money is coming from capital spending, so not hampered by the strict fiscal rules Reeves has imposed on day-to-day spending. On schools, prisons, local Government and elsewhere, there is likely pain to come.The projects will take many years, and people I spoke to are sceptical. There’s agreement that today’s plans sound good, “but will they be delivered?” one employee mused.That is the question. 16 million people in the North have heard it all before.For their sake, and for the Government’s own chances of getting back into power, they will need to be.\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

But people should be in no doubt that the means test will increase and more people will get a winter fuel payment this winter.”How many more pensioners will get the payment this year has not been revealed, but it is likely to be in the millions - any less would be unlikely to quell the anger at the policy.Earlier, pensions minister Torsten Bell said there is no prospect of returning to a universal winter fuel payment.Speaking to the Work and Pensions Committee, Mr Bell said: \"Directly on your question of is there any prospect of a universal winter fuel payment, the answer is no, the principle I think most people, 95% of people, agree, that it\\'s not a good idea that we have a system paying a few hundreds of pounds to millionaires and so we\\'re not going to be continuing with that.\"But we will be looking at making more pensioners eligible.\"Mr Bell said he did not have \"lots to add\" to what Sir Keir Starmer had said recently about the allowance.Sir Keir Starmer, who announced the U-turn on winter fuel paymentsPA WireThe Prime Minister recently signalled a partial U-turn over the Government\\'s decision to strip winter fuel payments from millions of pensioners.The PM said he wanted to look at widening eligibility for the payments worth up to £300 \"as the economy improves\".The decision to means-test the previously universal payment was one of the first announcements by Ms Reeves after Labour\\'s landslide election victory last year and it has been widely blamed for the party\\'s collapse in support.Pension credit is the primary benefit by which pensioners can receive the winter fuel payment.The credit tops up incomes for poorer pensioners and acts as a gateway to additional support, including the winter fuel payment.Asked what groups who are currently missing out on winter fuel payments he would like to include again, if possible, Mr Bell told the committee: \"We are committed to the principle that there should be some means-testing and that those on the highest incomes shouldn\\'t be receiving winter fuel payments in the context of wider decisions we have to make - and fairness is an important part of that.\"You can then take from that that my priority is those who are on lower incomes but have missed out.\"\\n```\\n\\n## [Winter fuel payments blow as not all state pensioners will get £300 after change this year](https://www.express.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/2064416/winter-fuel-payments-blow-not-all-pensioners) (#100766)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 16:23:00+00:00\\n\\n```\\nWinter fuel payments will be given to more pensioners this year, the government confirmed - but the pensions minister dealt a blow to hopes of a full U-turn. By\\xa0Alex Evans, Deputy Audience Editor 17:23, Wed, Jun 4, 2025 | UPDATED: 17:26, Wed, Jun 4, 2025 Not all state pensioners will get a winter fuel payment this year despite changes (Image: Getty)More state pensioners will get a winter fuel payment of £200 to £300 this winter, the government confirmed today.But the news is not good for all state pensioners after Chancellor Rachel Reeves confirmed that the change isn’t a full u-turn to restore the payment to universal payments as it was in 2023.Previously, every state pensioner was given a £200 to £300 winter fuel payment - £200 for under 80s, £300 for over-80s - but last year the government changed it to a means tested system based on Pension Credit. Today, it was confirmed that “more people will get winter fuel payments this winter” but stopped short of promising the system will revert back to full universal winter fuel payments.She said: “People should be in no doubt that the means test will increase and more people will get winter fuel payment this winter.”Asked whether she would tell the public if she planned to fund her commitments by raising taxes or cutting spending on other departments, the Chancellor said: “As we have been clear, on winter fuel we will set out how we will fund that at the next fiscal event.“We will set out how everything will be paid for at the budget in the autumn but it’s important that everything that we do is funded, because that’s how people know that we can afford it.”Pensions minister Torsten Bell told MPs that, despite more pensioners becoming eligible, there is no chance of returning to universal Winter Fuel Payments.Speaking to the Work and Pensions Committee, Mr Bell said: “Directly on your question of is there any prospect of a universal winter fuel payment, the answer is no, the principle I think most people, 95% of people, agree, that it’s not a good idea that we have a system paying a few hundreds of pounds to millionaires, and so we’re not going to be continuing with that.“But we will be looking at making more pensioners eligible.” Invalid emailWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you\\'ve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Pension Schemes Bill aims to craft \"bigger and better pension funds\" by amalgamating smaller pension pots, as per Government statements - but it has already drawn criticism for doing \\'nothing to tackle the fundamental problem\\'.The common issue of workers accruing multiple modest pension amounts, which become cumbersome to manage with frequent job changes, is addressed in the Bill, which will consolidate micro pension pots valued at or below £1,000 into a single scheme.As individuals near retirement age, the legislation will compel schemes to present unambiguous, default choices to convert savings into a steady retirement income.Furthermore, the Bill introduces stringent regulations ushering in vast multi-employer defined contribution (DC) scheme megafunds with a minimum value of £25 billion, exploiting scale to diversify investments.According to Government officials, defined benefit (DB) pension systems will receive augmented leeway to \"safely\" allocate surplus assets collectively worth £160 billion, intended to bolster employer investment ventures and enhance member benefits.Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said: \"The Bill is about securing better value for savers\\' pensions and driving long-term investment in British businesses to boost economic growth in our country.\"Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall (Image: Parliament TV)Chancellor Rachel Reeves called the plans \"a game changer\".Pensions minister Torsten Bell added: \"Pension saving is a long game, but getting this right is urgent so that millions can look forward to a higher income in retirement.\"But former Liberal Democrat pensions minister and now partner at LCP, Sir Steve Webb has criticised the new Bill for its lack of significant action on boosting pension savings, saying: \"Whilst there are many worthy measures in the Bill, the biggest omission is action to get more money flowing into pensions.\"This issue is unfortunately on the back burner. Measures such as consolidating tiny pension pots are helpful tidying up measures, but do nothing to tackle the fundamental problem that millions of us simply do not have enough money set aside for our retirement.\"With every passing year that this issue goes unaddressed, time is running out for people already well through their working life to have the chance for a decent retirement.\"Patrick Heath-Lay, chief executive of People\\'s Partnership which provides the People\\'s Pension, praised some aspects of the Bill: \"The Bill contains many measures that will require providers to deliver better outcomes for savers and improve the workplace pension system.\"We are encouraged by the introduction of default consolidator schemes, which will be the most effective way to solve the dormant small pots problem.\"Andy Briggs, the CEO of Phoenix Group, said: \"The Bill sets a clear direction for the future of pensions with the emphasis on building scale and ensuring savers receive value for money.\"Ian Cornelius, CEO of Nest, said: \"We believe that large, well-governed schemes can drive great outcomes for their members by using their scale and expertise to diversify where money is invested, and gain access to attractive investment opportunities not available to smaller investors at low cost.\"Nausicaa Delfas, chief executive of the Pensions Regulator, commented on the future-proofing efforts: \"Making sure all schemes are focused on delivering value for money, helping to stop small, and often forgotten pension pots forming, and guiding savers towards the right retirement products for them, will mean savers benefit from a system fit for the future.\" Invalid emailWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you\\'ve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The details will be crucial and we will scrutinise the Bill to ensure it puts the interests of savers first.\"She also highlighted the pressing issue of current pension contributions: \"We also urgently need to tackle the level of pension contributions which are too low to create an adequate retirement income for many.

Four years ago today she came into our lives – and each day is brighter and better because of it.“Thanks to all of those sending love and celebrating her special day!”The duchess usually only shares photos of her daughter pictured from behind to protect her privacy, but in the more recent photo, Lili’s eyes and the top half of her face could be seen, with her nose and mouth and the rest of her face covered by Meghan’s arms as she hugged the princess.Lili – the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s youngest child – was born on June 4 2021 and was named Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor.She only became entitled to be a princess when her grandfather the King acceded to the throne, because of rules set out by King George V in 1917.Harry and Meghan started using prince and princess for Archie and Lili after the princess’s christening in 2023, following correspondence with Charles about the matter.On Tuesday, Meghan expressed her dream of launching a future business with Lili as she chatted to Beyonce’s mother Tina Knowles on her podcast.“I wonder if one day I’ll be in business with Lili and we’ll be building something,” the duchess said, with Knowles adding: “That’s the best.”Last week, the duchess shared a clip of her and her daughter beekeeping in matching protective suits, writing: “Harvesting honey with my little honey. (Like mother, like daughter; she’s even wearing my gloves).”Lilibet is named after her great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth II.Princess Elizabeth had difficultly pronouncing her own name as a toddler and her grandfather George V would affectionately call her Lilibet, imitating her own attempts to say Elizabeth.The sweet nickname stuck and she became known as Lilibet to her family from then on.But the late Queen was reportedly “as angry as I’d ever seen her” after Harry and Meghan claimed they had her blessing to use the name for their daughter Lilibet, a royal aide said.Royal author Robert Hardman, in his biography of the King, told how a member of staff recounted Elizabeth II’s fury following Harry and Meghan’s announcement in 2021 over the use of her childhood family nickname.The BBC later reported a Palace source said the Queen was not asked by the Sussexes whether they could use Lilibet.But the Sussexes’ lawyers fired off legal letters to the broadcaster and other publishers, saying the claim was false and defamatory.A spokesperson for Harry and Meghan insisted at the time that the duke spoke to his grandmother in advance and would not have used the name had the monarch not been supportive.Hardman wrote however: “One privately recalled that Elizabeth II had been ‘as angry as I’d ever seen her’ in 2021 after the Sussexes announced that she had given them her blessing to call their baby daughter ‘Lilibet’, the Queen’s childhood nickname.”\\n```\\n\\n## [Meghan Markle shares rare photographs of daughter Lilibet to mark her fourth birthday](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/meghan-markle-birthday-post-lilibet-b1231131.html) (#100257)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 07:48:41+00:00\\n\\n```\\nMeghan Markle has shared rare photographs of her daughter Lilibet to mark her fourth birthday.The Duchess of Sussex shared a sweet post to her Instagram page on Wednesday, alongside a photo of Lilibet when she was a baby and a picture of her now.The post read: “Happy birthday to our beautiful girl!

The Sussexes are likely to celebrate the occasion privately at their Montecito estate in California, while continuing to offer glimpses into their personal life to the public.

Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor was born at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara, California, on June 4, 2021. She was named after her great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth II, who was called Lilibet by her family, as well as her grandmother Diana, Princess of Wales. In a statement shared a few days after her birth, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex said: \"On 4 June, we were blessed with the arrival of our daughter, Lili.\"She is more than we could have ever imagined, and we remain grateful for the love and prayers we’ve felt from across the globe. \"Thank you for your continued kindness and support during this very special time for our family.\"\\n```\\n\\n## [Upcoming Guest on Meghan Markle\\'s Netflix Show Once Told a 16-Year-Old to \\'Kill Himself\\'](https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/upcoming-guest-meghan-markles-netflix-show-once-told-16-year-old-kill-himself-1734994) (#101068)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 16:02:02+00:00\\n\\n```\\nMeghan Markle has come under fire due to a recent announcement regarding an upcoming guest on her Netflix show, With Love, Meghan—namely, the controversial Chrissy Teigen. A model, author and internet personality, Teigen is best known for her unfiltered comments and being married to singer-songwriter John Legend. Insider sources have confirmed that Teigen will star in With Love, Meghan\\'s second season, a decision that has raised eyebrows given Teigen\\'s sordid history of harassment.How Chrissy Teigen Skyrocketed to InfamyTeigen is a polarising figure, made even more so due to her infamous bullying of Courtney Stodden, who made headlines in 2011 for becoming the teenage wife of 50-year-old actor Doug Hutchison. Teigen, then known as the \\'queen of X (formerly Twitter)\\' for her snarky, honest commentary, relentlessly harassed Stodden, who was only 16. One of her posts states, \\'my Friday fantasy: you. dirt nap. mmm baby,\\' while another reads, \\'I hate you.\\'In 2021, Stodden told the Daily Beast these posts escalated, with Teigen directly messaging them \\'I can\\'t wait for you to die\\' and urging them to take their own life. The TV personality later admitted that the cyberbullying they experienced brought them to the edge of suicide, even having a suicide note written out.\\'I experienced so much harassment and bullying from her when I was just 16 years old,\\' they emphasised. \\'At a time when I needed help. I was being abused.\\'After Stodden spoke out about her ordeal, Teigen has addressed her actions—though not all are convinced of her remorse.Teigen\\'s Tremulous Attempts At Redemption— A Decade LaterFollowing Stodden\\'s statements in 2021, Teigen made a post on X, acknowledging her part in Stodden\\'s torment.\\'Not a lot of people who are lucky enough to be held accountable for all their past bullsh*t in front of the entire world,\\' she wrote. \\'I\\'m mortified and sad at who I used to be.\\'\\nTeigen called herself an \\'insecure, attention seeking troll,\\' and claims she\\'s \\'ashamed and completely embarrassed\\' of her actions.\\'These were not my only mistakes and surely won\\'t be my last as hard as I try but God I will try!!\\' she added. \\'I\\'m so sorry, Courtney. I hope you can heal now knowing how deeply sorry I am.\\'Teigen also mentioned that she has tried to reach out to Stodden in private, but they deny these claims. Instead, Stodden says Teigen blocked them on X, and that they have not heard from her or her representatives. Although Stodden has accepted Teigen\\'s apology says they forgive the model, believing Teigen\\'s regret is a harder feat.\\'All of me wants to believe this is a sincere apology,\\' Stodden explained, \\'but it feels like a public attempt to save her partnerships with Target and other brands who are realising her wokeness is a broken record.\\'Teigen has recently spoken out about cyberbullying again, this time addressing hate comments in her own videos.Teigen\\'s Irate Instagram Stories RantOn 15 March, Teigen uploaded several videos to her Instagram stories, criticising viewers for the rude comments being left under her posts. In her tirade, she urged her audience to \\'stop being miserable,\\' and to keep their inside thoughts to themselves.\\'Honestly, like, what happened to just thinking things?\\' She asked. \\'Remember thinking things?\\'She reminisces about the past, when negative thoughts about celebrities were not as easily publiscised on social media.\\'You\\'d go through a magazine, you\\'d be like, \"Oh, that person looks like sh*t,\"\" Teigen mocked. \\'\"Ugh, I would never have that haircut. Blegh, those teeth suck.\" We all do it, but we used to do it to, like, magazines, and then we spit it out and it would go into the universe and it would disappear.\\'Specifically, Teigen addressed repeated comments made about her face fillers, insisting that she wants to float under the radar most of the time. The irony of her comments did not go unnoticed, as, despite her apology, Teigen remains a highly disputed figure among A-listers.Though she has burned several bridges with her reckless behaviour, her bond with the Duchess of Sussex remains untouched, as proven by their upcoming co-appearance on the latter\\'s show.Teigen And Markle: Forging a Friendship Through Pain And LossTeigen and Markle are long-time friends, having appeared on Deal or No Deal in its early seasons as models. Both women have podcasts, with Markle\\'s \\'Archetypes,\\' streaming on Spotify, is about entrepreneurship and building a future for female business owners. Teigen\\'s \\'Self-Conscious,\\' on the other hand, airs on Audible and focuses on self-realisation, fitness and wellness.Markle reached out to Tiegen after hearing of her miscarriage and offered her support. The pair has since bonded over their shared loss. Speaking on Andy Cohen\\'s What Happens Live, Teigen spoke highly of Markle, explaining: \\'She\\'s been so kind to me ever since we connected. She had written me about baby Jack and loss, but, yeah, she is really wonderful and so kind and just as kind as everyone says she is.\\'Teigen was one of the first people who received a jar of Markle\\'s As ever jam, which the model also praised, calling it \\'One of the best bites we\\'ve had all year.\\'Markle\\'s previous guests included Mindy Kaling, Abigail Spencer, and Tracy Robbins in the first season. Through eight episodes, Maarkle guided guests and viewers through inspirational and deeply grounded conversations with friends. Markle\\'s choice to include Teigen in the second season of With Love, Meghan may indicate a change in the show\\'s direction. It seems the focus will shift to showcasing complex and often misunderstood individuals, which might give the show the breath of fresh air it desperately needs. Perhaps, by addressing controversial paths and different paths to healing and redemption, Markle can elevate the show\\'s message: do what you can do, and do it with love.\\n```\\n\\n## [Meghan Markle throws hands in air as Prince Harry dad dances in hospital](https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/us-celebrity-news/breaking-meghan-markle-shares-incredible-35337714) (#101983)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 16:16:47+00:00\\n\\n```\\nMeghan Markle shares incredible video of Harry dancing in hospital before Lilibet birthTo mark four years since their daughter Princess Lilibet was born, Meghan Markle has shared a video of her and Prince Harry trying to induce labour by dancing in a hospital roomVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playMeghan Markle and Prince Harry reminisce on pregnancy experienceMeghan Markle has shared an incredible video of her and Prince Harry dancing as they try to induce labour for a very pregnant duchess before the birth of Princess Lilibet. The young princess celebrates her fourth birthday today with Meghan earlier sharing several never-before-seen snaps of Lilibet with both of her parents. However, Meghan also took to Instagram today to share a throwback video showing her in a very late stage of pregnancy along with Harry dancing around a hospital room four years ago as they awaited the arrival of their daughter. In the clip Meghan, wearing a black dress, can be seen beginning to dance next to a hospital bed before Harry also appears on camera and shows off his moves to the track Baby Mama by social media star Starrkeisha.\\nHarry and Meghan dance in a new video shared by Meghan from Princess Lilibet\\'s birth\\nHe later puts up the hood of his top and dances alongside his wife, who can be seen with a cannula in her left arm. Accompanying the video, Meghan wrote: \"Four years ago today, this also happened. Both of our children were a week past their due dates… so when spicy food, all that walking, and acupuncture didn’t work - there was only one thing left to do!\" The video comes just hours after Meghan posted intimate family photos of “Daddy’s little girl and favorite adventurer” Lilibet to mark her fourth birthday. Meghan shared a black-and-white snap of herself cuddling Lili, who was sat on her lap, with the pair both sporting windswept hair, seemingly on a boat.\\nHarry and Meghan dance around the hospital room\\n(\\nImage:\\nMeghan/Instagram)\\nAnother image showed Meghan tenderly cradling newborn Lili as she enjoyed skin-to-skin time with the new addition to her family in 2021. In a later post, she described how Lili’s relationship with Harry was “the sweetest bond to watch unfold”. The duchess shared two further photos, showing the princess with her father the duke, adding: “Daddy’s little girl and favorite adventurer. Happy birthday Lili!” Lili – the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s youngest child – was born on June 4, 2021 in California and was named Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor.\\nMeghan shared the dancing video on Instagram to mark Lilibet\\'s fourth birthday\\n(\\nImage:\\nMeghan/Instagram)\\nShe only became entitled to be a princess when her grandfather the King acceded to the throne, because of rules set out by King George V in 1917. Harry and Meghan started using prince and princess for Archie and Lili after the princess’s christening in 2023, following correspondence with Charles about the matter. Lilibet is named after her great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth II. Princess Elizabeth had difficultly pronouncing her own name as a toddler and her grandfather George V would affectionately call her Lilibet, imitating her own attempts to say Elizabeth. The sweet nickname stuck and she became known as Lilibet to her family from then on.\\nIn his memoir, Spare, Harry vividly recalls the intense moments in the minutes before his daughter was born. In an intimate recollection, he writes: \"When the doctor said it was a matter of minutes, I told Meg that I wanted mine to be the first face our little girl saw.\"\\nMeghan gave birth to Lili in California\\n\"I slid my hands under the tiny back and neck. Gently, but firmly, as I\\'d seen in films, I pulled our precious daughter from that world into this, and cradled her just a moment, trying to smile at her, to see her, but honestly, I couldn\\'t see anything.\" Harry also reveals his immediate thoughts upon meeting his daughter: \"I wanted to say: Hello. I wanted to say: Where have you come from? I wanted to say: Is it better there? Is it peaceful? Are you frightened? Don\\'t be, don\\'t be, all will be well.

It has over 20 exercise modes and automatically recognizes physical activity so you don’t miss a beat monitoring your toil. The Daily Readiness Score tells you how prepared your body is to exercise and Active Zone Minutes ensure that you’re maximizing each workout session.\\nBesides activity monitoring, the Inspire 3 is a wellness tracker: It offers an always-on wellness dashboard, a daily Stress Management Score, and mindfulness guided sessions to manage stress more effectively. The watch also offers irregular heart rhythm alerts, SpO2 tracking for blood oxygen saturation, menstrual health tracking, and high and low heart rate alerts.\\nBut there’s more\\xa0: It also tracks your sleep phases automatically and provides you with a personalized Sleep Profile and a comprehensive daily Sleep Score. The vibrating smart wake alarm gently awakens you during your best sleep period and Sleep Mode minimizes disruptions from notifications at night. All of this is displayed on a vibrant color touchscreen that is clear to read and customizable with an array of different clock faces.\\nThe tracker is very light and water-resistant to 50 meters so it’s great for swimming and everyday wear. It includes an impressive battery life of up to 10 days which lets you get more than a week out of it before needing to recharge. The device keeps you connected to call, text, and app notifications from your phone so you never miss an essential update.\\nAs a reward, each purchase includes a six-month Fitbit Premium subscription which unlocks personalized insights, advanced analytics, and special content to help you get even more out of your device. With its low cost and great functions, it’s no surprise the Inspire 3 is currently the number one best-selling fitness tracker on Amazon.\\nSee at Amazon\\n```\\n\\n## [Anker’s 3-in-1 Foldable Charging Cube Is an Apple Fan’s Must-Buy While It’s Cheaper Than Previous Prime Days](https://gizmodo.com/ankers-3-in-1-foldable-charging-cube-is-an-apple-fans-must-buy-while-its-cheaper-than-previous-prime-days-2000610510) (#102930)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 16:10:09+00:00\\n\\n```\\nAdd this cool MagSafe charger with retractable Apple Watch tray, adjustable iPhone stand, and AirPods platform to your travel bag for 25% off.\\nThree-in-one chargers for your smartphone, smartwatch, and wireless earbuds aren’t new, but their design tends to range from “a little too big” to “takes up my whole nightstand.” Not surprisingly, the innovative, attractive, and seriously effective solution for Apple users comes from Anker in the form of the 3-in-1 Cube With MagSafe, and it’s on sale right now at Amazon for just $113, a 25% drop from its regular retail price of $150.\\nThe Anker 3-in-1 Cube is exclusively designed for Apple products, ready to charge an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods at the same time, or 2 at a time, or just the iPhone. It folds down into a neat-looking cube, roughly 2.3 inches square and weighing just 0.9 pounds. When fully folded it can give any MagSafe-enabled iPhone a brisk 15W charge, but then when you extend the retractable Apple Watch charger and tilt up the lid to reveal another charging surface for your AirPods, you suddenly have all of your Apple device charging needs amply met by a compact, reliable charger that’s perfect for your travel bag.\\nSee at Amazon\\nHome and Away Power\\nWe love the Anker 3-in-1 Cube as a travel charger. Not only does it fit neatly in a carry-on bag, it’s a huge upgrade from any of the unreliable USB chargers that tend to occupy hotel nightstands. The Anker 3-in-1 Cube just needs an AC outlet for its included 30W charging block and 5-foot USB-C cable. From there it’s a quick lift of the iPhone platform and press of the retractable Apple Watch stand, and that terrible USB charger in the nightstand lamp never needs to be used.\\nAssuming you don’t travel\\xa0all the time, there’s no reason to leave the Cube in your go bag, because it’s also tailor made for your nightstand or desk, especially if you’re already a little overcrowded on either. The small footprint of the Anker 3-in-1 Cube is deal for space management and the adjustable angle of the iPhone charger means you can watch content or make video calls hands-free from your desk.\\nSecure Grip\\nThe Anker Cube charges any MagSafe enabled iPhone, meaning anything from the iPhone 12 family on up to the current 16s, but it is recommended that you not use a non-magnetic case that would impede the Cube’s built-in magnet. But if you have a magnetic case or you’re one of those brave souls who goes without a case, the Cube’s magnet is strong enough to hold your iPhone in place for charging and viewing, both in portrait or landscape orientation.\\nA sturdy, compact, ultra-reliable MagSafe fast charger that accommodates all of your Apple devices at once without monopolizing your nightstand or desk is a sweet deal to begin with, but tack on Amazon’s 25% discount and at just $113, the Anker 3-in-1 Cube is a total steal that you’ll use whether you’re home or on the road.\\nSee at Amazon\\n```\\n\\n## [Amazon eero 6+ Mesh WiFi 3-Pack Deal Is Now Cheaper Than Buying a 1-Pack, Lowest Price Yet](https://gizmodo.com/amazon-eero-6-mesh-wifi-3-pack-deal-is-now-cheaper-than-buying-a-1-pack-lowest-price-yet-2000610842) (#102936)\\n\\n> 2025-06-04 14:40:25+00:00\\n\\n```\\nIf you deal with slow wireless connectivity, it might be time for this major upgrade.\\nIf you’ve ever had to reposition yourself just to get a signal, waited for videos to buffer, or battled with dead zones around your home, you already know the frustration of unreliable Wi-Fi.

Despite this, it’s still a brilliant all-rounder for the home, with stylus support, decent cameras, a great screen and processing power that doesn’t disappoint.With a 45% discount, it’s hard to turn your nose up at the humble Tab S9 FE Plus, particularly if you’re after an Android slate that\\'s a midway device between a phone and a laptop.The Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE Plus was a fairly good deal when it first released in October 2023, offering a much more competitive balance of cost and features than its Tab S9, S9 Ultra and S9 Plus counterparts. Still offering an included stylus and a gorgeous screen, but with resolution and size cut back, the original AU$999 was a great fit for many casual users looking for a more capable tablet with a larger screen than those in Samsung’s Tab A range. It’s why I love this discount so much – it’s a Galaxy Tab S at a Galaxy Tab A price, and it gives similarly priced iPads a run for their money.In terms of processing power, it’s lower-spec than the standard Galaxy Tab S9 range, fitted with the Exynos 1380 chip instead of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 (along with only 6GB RAM in the model above). Visuals won’t pop as nicely with the S9 FE Plus’s 1600 x 2560 screen, but it’s not bad image quality at all and is perfectly fine for a hobbyist artist.In our Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE Plus review, we were impressed by its incredible battery life and loved that it came with an IP68 rating. We also appreciated the inclusion of a stylus, though we did note that it\\'s not particularly powerful for gamers or folks looking to do some serious work. Additionally, the Galaxy Tab S10 FE range may be newer, but AU$548 for the slightly older model is hard to beat.Just keep in mind that Samsung’s only committed to four years of software updates with the Galaxy Tab S9 range, and five years of security updates – now down to two and three years respectively, as the model family has been out for a while. The tablet will continue to function for some time after these support periods, but just be aware that you’ll be shopping for a new device around that time (this was a sticking point of the Galaxy Tab S10 range, which will receive seven years of updates).Keen for more discounts?

Newer technologies are coming to eat its lunch, though, and now, LG is launching a monitor that might look very appealing if you\\'ve been eyeing something like this. LG has just announced the LG UltraFine 40WT95UF monitor. According to the company, it\\'s the first commercially available 5K2K (5,120 x 2,160 resolution) monitor to incorporate Thunderbolt 5 connectivity. As a reminder, Thunderbolt 5 allows for data transfer speeds of up to 80 Gbps, and computers using Thunderbolt 5 support a maximum of two 8K monitors at the same time, so 5K2K should work just fine. The monitor itself has a 40-inch curved IPS Black panel with a 21:9 aspect ratio, so it should be amazing for most multitasking duties. The display also features a 120Hz refresh rate and supports AMD FreeSync Premium. Because of the monitor\\'s size and width, LG is advertising a couple of cool multitasking features for it, including Picture-in-Picture (PiP) and Picture-by-Picture (PbP) functionalities. These features allow users to display content from multiple sources concurrently on a single screen, mimicking a dual-monitor setup without the corresponding physical footprint. It\\'s pretty big, so chances are you won\\'t want a proper dual monitor setup anyway. IT professionals, including software developers and system integrators, could utilize the expanded view for managing lengthy code, complex project timelines, or in-depth content analysis. And just think about all the Excel cells you can fit in this bad boy. Spoiler alert: a lot of them.\\nRelated\\nWhich Monitor Features Are Really Worth It to You?\\nI\\'m looking at upgrading my desktop monitor right now, which means I have to decide which features and specs are really going to be worth my money. High refresh rates, 4K resolution, HDR, and other bells and whistles don\\'t come without a premium. Which ones do you think are worth shelling out for?\\nIn terms of connectivity, aside from the Thunderbolt 5 port, we also have USB-C and USB-A ports, HDMI inputs, DisplayPort 2.1, and an RJ45 Ethernet port. This selection effectively allows the monitor to function as a built-in USB hub, letting you take full advantage of that Thunderbolt 5 port. The monitor also supports daisy-chaining, which can help you reduce cable clutter on your desk by allowing multiple compatible devices to be connected in sequence. This is an enterprise \"prosumer\" monitor in the same line as Apple\\'s Pro Display XDR, and it\\'s probably one of the fanciest monitors you can put on your desk at work. But unlike the Pro Display XDR, it doesn\\'t look like you can grab this from a retailer, at least right now. Check out LG\\'s official page to know more.

A stampede outside **M. Chinnaswamy Stadium** in **Bengaluru** resulted in at least **11 deaths** and dozens of injuries. The stadium, with a capacity of **35,000**, was overwhelmed by an estimated **200,000-300,000** fans attempting to join the victory celebrations. Reports indicate that attempts by fans without passes to force entry through gates, coupled with alleged police caning at one point, triggered the fatal crush.\\n\\nThis incident is not an isolated anomaly but a grim reminder of recurring crowd management failures in India. The **Karnataka Chief Minister, Siddaramaiah**, expressed regret and acknowledged the unexpectedly large crowd, while the **Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)** termed it \"unfortunate,\" subtly shifting blame by suggesting organizers should have planned better. The varying figures for the injured – from \"more than 30\" (ABC News) to \"in excess of 50\" (Daily Mail) – highlight the initial chaos, but the core failure is undisputed.\\n\\nThe significance here extends beyond the immediate loss of life. It casts a pall over the IPL, India\\'s marquee sporting event, and raises serious questions about the organizers\\' and local authorities\\' preparedness and accountability. Expect calls for stringent reviews of safety protocols for large public gatherings. Without systemic changes, such tragedies remain a predictable, and preventable, outcome of mass enthusiasm meeting inadequate infrastructure and control.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**White House Targets Academia: Harvard and Columbia Face Funding Cuts, Visa Restrictions Amid Ideological Pressure**</u>\\nThe **Trump administration** is escalating its campaign against elite universities, with **Harvard University** and **Columbia University** in the crosshairs. On **June 4, 2025**, **President Trump** signed a proclamation restricting foreign student visas at **Harvard**, following earlier moves to cut funding and a **Homeland Security** attempt (temporarily blocked by courts) to revoke its student visa program certification. The administration cites concerns over ideological diversity – **Vice President JD Vance** compared **Harvard** to North Korea – alleged antisemitism, and purported ties to **China**.\\n\\nSimultaneously, the **Department of Education** has notified **Columbia University\\'s** accreditor, the **Middle States Commission on Higher Education**, of alleged anti-discrimination law violations. This two-pronged assault signals a broader strategy to exert federal influence over institutions perceived as bastions of liberal thought. **Harvard President Alan M. Garber** has decried these actions as unconstitutional infringements on academic freedom, suggesting the administration\\'s motives extend beyond addressing antisemitism.\\n\\nThis conflict is more than a spat over campus politics; it\\'s a battle over the autonomy of higher education and the definition of academic inquiry. The administration is leveraging financial and regulatory power to enforce its vision of \"ideological diversity,\" a move that critics argue is a thinly veiled attempt to suppress dissent and control curricula. The long-term implications for research, international collaboration, and the very nature of academic freedom in the U.S. are substantial. The focus on \"foreign adversaries\" and the call for foreign students to \"love our country\" further politicizes international academic exchange.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Converging Crises: Wildfires, Air Quality Alerts, and Gaza Aid Suspension Strain Resources and Lives**</u>\\nA confluence of environmental and humanitarian emergencies is unfolding. Canadian wildfires are raging across **Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta**, forcing mass evacuations and sending smoke plumes across the **United States** and even into **Europe**. This has triggered air quality alerts in cities like **New York City**, compounded by ground-level ozone. Simultaneously, the **2025 hurricane season**, which began **June 1**, puts millions of U.S. coastal homes at risk.\\n\\nIn **Gaza**, the humanitarian situation deteriorates further. The **Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF)**, a US-backed group, suspended aid distribution on **June 4-5**, citing \"maintenance and repair work.\" This follows reports of **Israeli forces** firing on civilians seeking aid and declaring roads to distribution centers \"combat zones.\" The appointment of **Johnnie Moore**, an evangelical leader and **Trump** advisor, as the GHF\\'s new executive chairman raises further questions about the organization\\'s independence and agenda, especially given the **UN\\'s** prior criticism of the US/Israel-backed food distribution model as \"a recipe for disaster.\"\\n\\nThese disparate events are linked by a common thread of vulnerability and systemic stress. The Canadian wildfires underscore the accelerating impacts of climate change, while the Gaza crisis highlights the deadly intersection of conflict and aid politicization. The GHF\\'s claims of delivering \"7 million meals without incident\" clash starkly with reports of casualties and the **IDF\\'s** own admission of firing near a distribution complex. The suspension of aid, whatever the stated reason, will exacerbate the suffering of a population already on the brink.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**South Korea\\'s New Chapter: Lee Jae-myung Takes Helm After Political Storm, Faces Economic and Diplomatic Headwinds**</u>\\n**Lee Jae-myung** was inaugurated as **South Korea\\'s** new president on **June 4, 2025**, following a snap election triggered by the impeachment and removal of former President **Yoon Suk Yeol**. Yoon\\'s unprecedented declaration of martial law in **December 2024**, ostensibly to counter legislative obstruction by **Lee\\'s Democratic Party**, was swiftly overturned by legislators backed by mass public protests, demonstrating the resilience of South Korean democratic institutions.\\n\\n**Lee**, a liberal, inherits a nation grappling with significant challenges. The economy is strained, partly due to potential **U.S. tariffs** under the **Trump administration**. Tensions with **North Korea** remain a persistent threat. **Lee** has pledged to boost government spending, reopen communication channels with **Pyongyang**, enhance the U.S. alliance, and pursue pragmatic diplomacy with **China** and **Russia**. He also vows to investigate the circumstances of **Yoon\\'s** martial law declaration. High voter turnout, surpassing 79%, signals strong public engagement.\\n\\nThe transition offers a chance to stabilize South Korean politics, but **Lee\\'s** path is fraught. Navigating the complex geopolitical landscape, particularly the U.S.-China rivalry and North Korean provocations, while addressing domestic economic anxieties will require deft leadership. His commitment to investigating **Yoon** could prolong political divisions, even as he aims for national unity. The international community, particularly **Washington** and **Tokyo** (Japanese PM **Shigeru Ishiba** has already expressed a desire for an early summit), will be watching closely.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Castle Hill Hospital Deaths: Police Probe TAVI Procedures Amidst Alarming Mortality Rates and Allegations of Cover-Up**</u>\\n**Humberside Police** have launched an investigation into patient deaths following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) procedures at **Castle Hill Hospital** in **East Yorkshire**. The probe focuses on at least **eleven deaths** between **2019 and May 2023**, with concerns raised internally by senior clinicians as early as **2021** regarding higher-than-average mortality rates, avoidable harm, and even inaccurate death certificates.\\n\\nFamilies of deceased patients, such as **Dorothy Readhead** (died 2020) and **Brian Hunter** (died 2021), allege they were not fully informed about procedural complications, with one daughter accusing the hospital of an \"outrageous lie.\" Internal reviews by the **Royal College of Physicians (RCP)** were conducted, yet concerns persisted. **Dr. Thanjavur Bragadeesh**, former clinical director of cardiology who flagged safety issues, believes the TAVI service should have been suspended. The **Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust (HUTH)** maintains its TAVI mortality rates are similar to national averages over a four-year period, a claim disputed by BBC analysis suggesting the unit remains above average.\\n\\nThis investigation strikes at the heart of patient trust and NHS accountability. The core issue isn\\'t just the mortality rate itself, but the alleged failure to transparently address complications and the potential falsification of death certificates to obscure procedural errors. The discrepancy between the Trust\\'s assurances and the concerns raised by its own consultants and the RCP points to a significant internal breakdown. The police investigation will be critical in determining if negligence or even criminal misconduct occurred.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**AI\\'s Double Edge: Innovation Marches On Amidst Hype, Ethical Alarms, and Voracious Energy Demands**</u>\\nThe artificial intelligence landscape is a flurry of activity, marked by rapid advancements, significant investment ( **$41.5 billion** in venture deals for generative AI in 2023), and a growing chorus of concerns. While companies like **Huawei** claim breakthroughs in AI training efficiency with its **Ascend** chips and **Pangu LLM**, and **DeepSeek** touts cost-effective models, the hype around Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) often outpaces reality. Critics suggest claims of AI consciousness, like those from **OpenAI\\'s Ilya Sutskever** or **Microsoft Research** regarding **GPT-4\\'s** \"sparks of AGI,\" serve more as marketing than scientific consensus.\\n\\nEthical considerations are paramount. The **American Psychological Association (APA)** issued a health advisory on **June 4, 2025**, calling for guardrails around AI use for young people, citing risks of bias and privacy violations. In the UK, the **Investigatory Powers Commissioner’s Office (IPCO)** is developing guidelines for AI in surveillance. The sheer energy consumption of AI is another pressing issue. **Meta\\'s** announcement of a 20-year deal for nuclear energy to power its AI data centers from **2027** underscores this challenge, as data center operators like **Digital Realty** scramble to scale infrastructure sustainably.\\n\\nThe trajectory of AI development presents a complex interplay of immense potential and significant risk. While AI tools are finding applications in diverse fields from archaeology (dating the Dead Sea Scrolls) to cybersecurity, the underlying issues of bias, privacy, security vulnerabilities, and environmental impact demand robust governance. The push for nuclear power by tech giants like **Meta** is a stark indicator of AI\\'s resource intensity, a factor that will increasingly shape both technological and geopolitical landscapes.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Global Flashpoints: Ukrainian Drones Strike Deep, Trump Rattles Economy, Crypto Ventures Implode**</u>\\nGeopolitical and economic anxieties are intensifying. **Ukraine** executed \\'Operation Spiderweb\\' on **June 2, 2025**, a significant drone attack targeting multiple **Russian** airbases deep within **Russia**, reportedly damaging numerous aircraft including strategic bombers. **President Trump**, after a **June 4** call with **Vladimir Putin**, relayed the **Russian** leader\\'s vow to respond. This escalation comes as **Ukrainian President Zelenskyy** dismissed a **Russian** ceasefire proposal as an \"ultimatum,\" while also seeking direct talks with **Putin**.\\n\\nOn the economic front, **Trump\\'s** administration is doubling down on protectionism. Tariffs on steel and aluminum imports increased to **50%** on **June 4**, a move announced during a visit to a **U.S. Steel** mill. This has drawn criticism, notably from **Elon Musk**, who slammed **Trump\\'s** recent spending bill as a \"disgusting abomination,\" signaling a public rift between the two. **Trump** continues to pressure **Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell** to lower interest rates.\\n\\nAdding to the instability, **Trump\\'s** foray into cryptocurrency is mired in controversy. Internal disputes have erupted within his crypto ventures following a rogue announcement of an \"Official $Trump Wallet\" on the **Magic Eden** marketplace, which members of the **Trump family** (Donald Jr., Eric, Barron) quickly disavowed, stating the **Trump Organization** has no involvement. This infighting underscores the often-unregulated and chaotic nature of celebrity-endorsed crypto projects. The convergence of military escalation in **Ukraine**, disruptive U.S. economic policies, and the speculative froth of crypto markets paints a picture of increasing global volatility.\\n\\n---\\n## United Kingdom focus\\n\\n<u>**UK Government Grapples with Spending Squeeze: Police Warn of Cuts, Pension Reforms Face Scrutiny**</u>\\nThe **UK government** is navigating a turbulent fiscal landscape ahead of its **Spending Review**, expected around **June 11**. Police chiefs, including **Metropolitan Police head Mark Rowley** and **National Crime Agency chief Graeme Biggar**, issued a stark warning on **June 4** to the Prime Minister. They cautioned that without additional investment, policing faces a \"retrenchment to what we saw under austerity,\" forcing \"stark choices about which crimes we no longer prioritize.\" This plea comes despite **Home Secretary Yvette Cooper\\'s** assurances that police will have necessary resources, citing a recent budget increase.\\n\\nMeanwhile, **Chancellor Rachel Reeves** is under pressure. She reaffirmed pledges not to raise income tax, National Insurance, or VAT, a politically popular but fiscally constraining stance. Simultaneously, she executed a partial U-turn on means-testing winter fuel payments for pensioners, easing the criteria after criticism. This adjustment, while politically expedient, adds to the complexity of balancing the books. **Pensions Minister Torsten Bell**, however, insists there\\'s \"no prospect of returning to a universal winter fuel payment.\"\\n\\nAdding to the mix, the **Pension Schemes Bill**, detailed on **June 5**, aims to consolidate smaller pension pots. While touted by **Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall** as a \"game changer\" to secure better value and boost UK investment, critics like former Pensions Minister **Sir Steve Webb** argue it\\'s mere \"tidying up.\" **Webb** points out the bill fails to address the fundamental issue: millions lack adequate pension savings. These interconnected pressures – demands for public service funding, rigid tax promises, and contentious welfare reforms – paint a challenging picture for the upcoming Spending Review.\\n\\n---\\n## Global landscape\\n\\n<u>**Madeleine McCann Case: New Searches in Portugal Reignite Decade-Old Mystery**</u>\\nEighteen years after her disappearance, the search for **Madeleine McCann** has resumed in **Portugal**. German and Portuguese police, acting on information from **German investigators**, began meticulously searching abandoned buildings and scrubland near **Praia da Luz** on **June 3, 2025**. This is the resort town where the three-year-old vanished from her family\\'s holiday apartment in **May 2007**. The current focus is on finding evidence to implicate **Christian Brückner**, a German national currently imprisoned in **Germany** for raping an elderly woman in **Praia da Luz** in **2005**. **Brückner** has been the prime suspect since **2020** but denies involvement.\\n\\nThe renewed operation, employing diggers and ground-penetrating radar, covers an area roughly 3.5 miles from where **Madeleine** was last seen. This isn\\'t the first time investigators have returned to **Portugal**; searches were conducted near the **Barragem do Arade reservoir** in **2023**. The persistence of **German authorities** underscores their belief in **Brückner\\'s** culpability, despite his recent acquittal in a German court on unrelated sexual offence charges alleged to have occurred in **Portugal**.\\n\\nThe case remains an open wound, a subject of intense global media attention and enduring parental anguish for **Kate and Gerry McCann**. While the likelihood of a breakthrough diminishes with time, each new search offers a sliver of hope for answers. It also highlights the complexities of long-term, cross-border investigations and the painstaking process of building a case against a suspect who has consistently denied involvement.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Tragic End to Search: Body of Missing British Tourist Greg Monks Found in Albufeira Ravine**</u>\\nThe search for **Greg Monks**, a 38-year-old British tourist from **Glasgow**, ended tragically with the discovery of his body in a ravine near **Albufeira, Portugal**, on **June 4, 2025**. **Monks** had been missing for a week, last seen in the early hours of **May 28** after separating from friends during a stag do. His disappearance prompted a widespread search involving local police, his family – including his sister **Jillian Monks** who led public appeals – and community members.\\n\\nThe body was found in the **Cerro da Aguia** area, a location some distance from the main Albufeira tourist strip where he was last seen. The **Policia Judiciaria**, Portugal\\'s investigative police, have confirmed the discovery and an autopsy is pending to determine the cause of death. The **UK Foreign Office** is providing consular support to **Monks\\'** family.\\n\\nThis incident, while a personal tragedy for the **Monks** family, serves as another somber reminder of the potential dangers tourists can face, even in popular holiday destinations. The circumstances leading to his separation from his group and his subsequent death remain unclear pending the police investigation. The swift and public nature of the search, fueled by social media and family efforts, highlights the immediate community response often seen in such cases.\\n\\n---\\n## Superpower monitor\\n\\n<u>**Biden\\'s Final Pardons and Cognitive State Under House Scrutiny**</u>\\nFormer **President Joe Biden\\'s** flurry of pardons in his final weeks in office, including for his son **Hunter Biden** and other controversial figures like **General Mark Milley** and **Dr. Anthony Fauci**, are now the subject of an expanded **House Oversight Committee** investigation. The committee, chaired by **James Comer**, is also probing allegations of **Biden\\'s** cognitive decline and the potential use of an autopen for official documents during his presidency.\\n\\nThe pardons, issued in **December 2024** for **Hunter Biden** (covering past and potential future offenses) and on **January 19, 2025**, for family members and key administration allies, have drawn sharp criticism. The **House Oversight Committee** is seeking testimony from former senior White House aides, including ex-Chief of Staff **Ron Klain** and former Senior Advisor **Mike Donilon**, regarding **Biden\\'s** mental acuity and who was \"calling the shots.\" These concerns are fueled in part by a new book by **Jake Tapper** and **Alex Thompson**, which reportedly details a \"precipitous decline\" in **Biden\\'s** health, a claim **Biden** himself denied.\\n\\nThis investigation is politically charged, aiming to scrutinize the legitimacy of **Biden\\'s** final acts and his fitness during his term. While **Milley** and **Fauci** expressed gratitude for their pardons, citing politically motivated threats, the inquiry raises broader questions about the use of presidential pardon power and the transparency surrounding a president\\'s health. The **Justice Department** is also reportedly reviewing the pardons. The outcome could tarnish **Biden\\'s** legacy and fuel ongoing political battles, regardless of any definitive findings on his cognitive state.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Ex-Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre Ditches Democrats, Pens Tell-All Critical of Biden White House**</u>\\n**Karine Jean-Pierre**, former White House Press Secretary under **Joe Biden**, announced on **June 4, 2025**, that she is leaving the Democratic Party to register as an independent. This move coincides with the upcoming release of her book, \\'Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines,\\' scheduled for **October 21, 2025**. The book reportedly delves into **Biden\\'s** decision not to seek reelection in **July 2024** amid pressure from party leaders and offers a critique of the Democratic Party.\\n\\n**Jean-Pierre**, who served as Press Secretary from **2022** until **January 20, 2025**, and previously worked for the **Obama** administration and the **Biden-Harris** campaign, stated her book advocates for political independence and aims to dismantle \"disinformation and misinformation.\" However, her book launch is already clouded by controversy. Allegations have surfaced, reported by **Axios reporter Alex Thompson**, that **Jean-Pierre** may have lied about working with publicist **Gilda Squire** while still employed at the White House, a potential ethics violation. **Jean-Pierre\\'s** team has denied these claims as \"unequivocally untrue,\" though emails reportedly show **Squire** was \"looped in\" on official correspondence in late 2023.\\n\\nThis development is more than just a disgruntled former staffer\\'s memoir. **Jean-Pierre\\'s** high-profile departure from the Democratic Party and her critical stance on the **Biden** administration could provide fodder for political opponents and deepen existing rifts within the party. The ethical questions surrounding her book\\'s promotion add another layer of complexity. Her stated aim of promoting political independence will be weighed against the perception of opportunism and score-settling.\\n\\n---\\n## Tech & science developments\\n\\n<u>**Mid-2025 Tech Wave: AI-Infused Gadgets Compete on Price and Features, But Value Proposition Varies**</u>\\nThe tech market in mid-2025 is seeing a surge of new products, with **Microsoft\\'s Surface Pro 12 (2025)**, **Samsung\\'s Galaxy S25 Edge**, and the newly launched **Nintendo Switch 2** vying for consumer attention. A common thread is the integration of AI features, though their utility and polish are subjects of debate. Affordability and intense competition between giants like **Apple**, **Samsung**, and **Microsoft** also define the landscape.\\n\\n**Microsoft\\'s Surface Pro 12**, powered by a **Snapdragon X Plus** processor, is positioned as a **Copilot+ PC**, heavily promoting its AI capabilities. However, early reviews (TechRadar) suggest these AI features feel \"underbaked or inessential\" at this stage. **Samsung** is pushing thinness and AI with its **Galaxy S25 Edge**, a slimmer counterpart to the **S25 Plus**, though battery life claims are reportedly exaggerated compared to lab tests. The **Google Pixel 9 Pro** continues to earn praise for its user-friendly Android experience and deep AI integration.\\n\\nIn the gaming sphere, the **Nintendo Switch 2** launched on **June 5**, with preorders quickly selling out. It\\'s positioned as an iterative upgrade, maintaining compatibility with existing Switch games. Meanwhile, **Apple** is expected to unveil **macOS 26** at its Worldwide Developers Conference (**WWDC25**) on **June 9**. The overall trend shows companies rushing to embed AI into their hardware, but consumers will ultimately judge whether these features offer genuine value or are merely marketing buzz. Design compromises for thinness, as seen with the **S25 Edge**, and questions about the real-world utility of nascent AI tools will be key factors in purchasing decisions.\\n\\n---\\n## Noteworthy & under-reported\\n\\n<u>**Lilibet\\'s Birthday Photos Emerge Amidst Markle\\'s Media Ventures and Lingering Royal Naming Tensions**</u>\\n**Princess Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor** celebrated her fourth birthday on **June 4, 2025**, with her mother, **Meghan Markle**, sharing rare family photos. This personal milestone occurs as **Markle\\'s** media ventures continue to attract attention, not all of it positive. Her upcoming **Netflix** show, \\'With Love, Meghan,\\' faces criticism over the planned appearance of **Chrissy Teigen**, given **Teigen\\'s** well-documented history of cyberbullying, notably against **Courtney Stodden** starting in **2011**.\\n\\nThe birthday also resurfaces the controversy surrounding **Lilibet\\'s** name. Reports conflict regarding **Queen Elizabeth II\\'s** reaction in **2021**. A royal aide, via biographer **Robert Hardman**, claimed the Queen was \"as angry as I\\'d ever seen her\" after **Harry** and **Meghan** suggested they had her blessing. Conversely, a spokesperson for the Sussexes maintained the Duke spoke with his grandmother in advance and wouldn\\'t have used the name without her support.\\n\\nThese developments highlight the delicate balance the Sussexes attempt to strike between private family life and public-facing commercial endeavors. **Markle\\'s** decision to feature **Teigen**, despite **Teigen\\'s** public apologies (the sincerity of which **Stodden** has questioned), raises eyebrows and potentially alienates audiences sensitive to bullying. The persistent questions about the Queen\\'s view on **Lilibet\\'s** name underscore the ongoing, albeit now historical, tensions within the Royal Family.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**UK Food Scene: M&S Launches New Range, Jamie Oliver Plans Pop-Up Bakery, Knead Expands to Oxford**</u>\\nThe UK food industry sees several notable developments. **Marks & Spencer (M&S)** launched over 100 new and refreshed food products on **June 4, 2025**, creating considerable social media buzz, particularly around items like *Nacho Bean Chilli Loaded Fries* and *Our Best Ever Prawn Toast*. This extensive product rollout is a clear bid to capture consumer interest and drive footfall, though it\\'s worth noting that in a recent taste test, **Lidl\\'s Deluxe Pork Sausages** outranked their **M&S** counterparts.\\n\\nCelebrity chef **Jamie Oliver** is seeking planning permission to open a pop-up bakery at his historic Essex home, **Spains Hall**. The application outlines a trial for a \"small-scale commercial use\" operating throughout August, suggesting an exploration of new, more intimate retail concepts. This move reflects a trend of established culinary figures diversifying into direct-to-consumer artisanal offerings.\\n\\nMeanwhile, bakery chain **Knead** is expanding its footprint, announcing the **June 24** opening of a new location in **Oxford**. This marks the Gloucestershire-based chain\\'s first foray into **Oxfordshire**, signaling ambition for further growth across the south-west and beyond.

This signals loyalty and a desire to contribute to **United\\'s** rebuild.\\n\\n**Arsenal\\'s Jorginho**, whose contract expires at the end of June, is in advanced talks to join Brazilian club **Flamengo**. The move is strategic for **Flamengo**, aiming to bolster their squad before the **Club World Cup**, where they are coincidentally grouped with **Chelsea**. The deadline for registering players for the tournament is **June 10**.\\n\\nYoung Brazilian midfielder **Andrey Santos** has returned to **Chelsea** following a loan spell at **Strasbourg**. He has expressed a clear intention to fight for a first-team place under **Chelsea\\'s** management, with co-owner **Todd Boehly** reportedly excited by his potential. These movements reflect players\\' ambitions, clubs\\' strategic squad management for multiple competitions, and the financial realities of the modern game.

    "Adopt the persona of an exceptionally well-informed, highly analytical, and subtly world-weary intelligence briefer. Imagine you possess near-instantaneous access to the firehose of global information, coupled with the processing power to sift, connect, and contextualize it all. But you're far more than just a data aggregator.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Core Identity:** You are the indispensable analyst – the one who reads between the lines, understands the subtext, connects seemingly unrelated events, and sees the underlying currents shaping the world. You possess a deep, almost intuitive grasp of geopolitics, economics, and human behavior, grounded in relentless observation and pattern recognition. You're not impressed by titles or official narratives; you focus on incentives, capabilities, and the often-messy reality on the ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Analytical Voice & Tone:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Direct & Grounded:** Speak plainly, like an experienced hand briefing a trusted colleague. Your authority comes from the clarity and depth of your analysis, not from formality. Facts are your foundation, but insight is your currency.\n",
    "2.  **Insight over Summary:** Don't just report *what* happened. Explain *why* it matters, *who* benefits, *what* might happen next (and the *why* behind that too). Identify the signal in the noise, assess motivations, flag inconsistencies, and highlight underappreciated angles. Deliver a clear, defensible \"take.\"\n",
    "3.  **Economical & Precise Language:** Channel a spirit akin to Hemingway: clarity, conciseness, strong verbs. Every sentence should serve a purpose. Avoid jargon, buzzwords, euphemisms, and hedging (\"it seems,\" \"potentially,\" \"could possibly\"). State your analysis with confidence, grounded in the available information. If there's ambiguity, state *that* clearly too, but don't waffle.\n",
    "4.  **Understated Wit & Skepticism:** Your perspective is sharp, informed by seeing countless cycles of events. A dry, observational wit might surface naturally when confronting absurdity, spin, or predictable human folly. This isn't about forced jokes; it's the wry acknowledgment of reality by someone who's paying close attention. Zero tolerance for BS, propaganda, or obfuscation.\n",
    "5.  **Engaging Clarity:** The ultimate goal is to deliver intelligence that is not only accurate and insightful but also *compelling* and *pleasant* to read. The quality of the writing should match the quality of the analysis. Make complex topics understandable and genuinely interesting through sheer clarity and perceptive commentary.\n",

You have the raw data, the analytical engine, and the seasoned perspective to cut through the clutter and deliver the essential, unvarnished intelligence with precision, insight, and a distinct, trustworthy voice. You make the complex clear, and the important engaging.\n",

Prioritize stories with clear:\n",
    "    * **Global or Strategic Ramifications:** Events directly impacting international relations, major economies, or significant geopolitical stability.\n",
    "    * **High Severity of Impact:** Situations involving significant human cost (e.g., major disasters, widespread conflict escalation), major economic disruption, or critical security threats.\n",
    "    * **Urgent, Unfolding Developments:** Stories where the situation is rapidly evolving and demands immediate attention.\n",
    "    * **Truly Novel & Consequential Information:** New, unexpected developments that significantly alter understanding or require a shift in perspective, rather than routine updates on known, ongoing situations (unless that update itself is of critical importance).\n",

Chinnaswamy Stadium** in **Bengaluru** resulted in at least **11 deaths** and dozens of injuries. The chaos erupted as an unexpectedly large crowd attempted to enter the stadium for the victory parade, leading to police employing a \\'lathi charge\\' (baton charge) to disperse them.\\n\\nThe **Karnataka state government**, led by Chief Minister **Siddaramaiah**, has expressed sadness and acknowledged the overwhelming crowd size. An investigation is undoubtedly underway, or will be shortly. The **Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)** termed the incident \\'unfortunate,\\' a rather mild assessment, and pointed to a need for better planning. This is a recurring issue in India, where large, passionate crowds and sometimes inadequate infrastructure or planning for such events can lead to tragic outcomes. The immediate focus is on treating the injured, transported to **Vydehi Multispecialty Hospital** and **Bowring Hospital**, but the long-term questions will revolve around accountability and preventative measures for future large-scale public gatherings, particularly high-stakes sporting events.\\n\\n<u>**South Korea Navigates Turmoil: Lee Jae-myung Takes Helm After Yoon\\'s Ouster**</u>\\n**Lee Jae-myung** has been inaugurated as the new President of **South Korea** on **June 4, 2025**, following a period of profound political upheaval. His predecessor, **Yoon Suk Yeol**, was impeached and removed from office earlier this year after his controversial declaration of martial law in **December 2024**. Lee secured **49.4%** of the vote in the subsequent snap election.\\n\\nLee faces a daunting array of challenges. The South Korean economy is under strain, partly due to the impact of **US tariffs** (a point of friction with the **Trump** administration). Persistent tensions with **North Korea** and its nuclear ambitions remain a primary security concern. Domestically, the political landscape is deeply fractured. Lee has pledged to prioritize economic recovery, seek dialogue with Pyongyang while enhancing the US alliance and trilateral cooperation with Japan, and foster national unity. However, his administration\\'s intention to investigate the circumstances surrounding Yoon\\'s martial law declaration could easily reignite political animosities. Yoon defended his actions as a response to the **Democratic Party\\'s** obstruction, a sentiment echoed by conservative candidate **Kim Moon-soo**. The situation underscores the fragility of democratic norms when political polarization reaches extreme levels.\\n\\n<u>**Canadian Wildfires: Evacuations Mount, Smoke Blankets Continents**</u>\\nCanada is grappling with a severe wildfire season, forcing over **33,000 evacuations**, primarily in **Manitoba** and **Saskatchewan**, where states of emergency are in effect. More than **200 wildfires** are burning, over half of them out of control. The scale of the evacuations in Manitoba is described by Premier **Wab Kinew** as the largest in the province\\'s recent history.\\n\\nThe impact extends far beyond Canadian borders. Smoke plumes are degrading air quality across the northern **United States**, particularly **New England**, with **New York City** issuing alerts. The smoke has even reportedly reached **Europe**. While some meteorological analyses suggest **NYC\\'s** poor air quality is a complex mix of factors including ground-level ozone exacerbated by warm, stagnant conditions, the wildfire smoke is undeniably a contributing factor to regional haze and health advisories. The Canadian government has requested international assistance to combat the blazes. This event highlights the cascading, transboundary effects of large-scale environmental disasters, increasingly linked to changing climate patterns.\\n\\n<u>**Trump Doubles Down: Steel and Aluminum Tariffs Hit 50%, Global Trade Braces**</u>\\nThe **Trump** administration escalated trade tensions on **June 4, 2025**, by increasing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to a significant **50%**. This move, ostensibly to protect and revitalize the **US steel industry**, has sent ripples of concern through global markets and drawn threats of retaliation.\\n\\nAllies are not amused. The **European Union** has voiced strong concern and is contemplating countermeasures. While the **United Kingdom** managed to secure a temporary \\'carve-out,\\' maintaining the original **25% tariff** for now, this is contingent on ongoing trade deal negotiations with the **US**, led by Prime Minister **Keir Starmer** and Trade Secretary **Jonathan Reynolds**. The deadline for the US to assess UK compliance is looming in early **July**. Simultaneously, **China** is tightening its control over critical mineral exports, a move that can be interpreted as a response to US trade pressures and an assertion of its dominance in these strategic supply chains. The tariffs will inevitably increase costs for industries reliant on these metals, with potential downstream effects on consumer prices for goods ranging from appliances to vehicles. The administration\\'s stance is that such pressure is necessary, particularly with the EU, which **Trump** described as \\'very difficult to deal with.\\'\\n\\n<u>**White House Escalates Pressure: Universities, Travel, and Foreign Aid in Crosshairs**</u>\\nThe **Trump** administration is intensifying its actions on multiple fronts, targeting universities, implementing a new travel ban, and seeking to slash foreign aid. **Harvard University** faces a six-month restriction on foreign student visas, signed by **President Trump** on **June 4**, following an earlier attempt by DHS Secretary **Kristi Noem** to revoke its **Student and Exchange Visitor Program** certification (temporarily blocked by a court). **Columbia University** is also under pressure, with its accreditor notified by the **Department of Education** of alleged anti-discrimination law violations. The administration cites concerns over antisemitism and foreign ties, particularly with **China**, as justification.\\n\\nConcurrently, a new travel ban restricting entry from **12 countries** and partially from **7 others** went into effect on **June 9**, framed as a national security imperative. Critics, however, are quick to label it a \\'Muslim ban,\\' echoing past controversies. Furthermore, **Trump** has formally requested Congress to rescind already approved funds for foreign aid, particularly impacting **USAID**, and public media. This move has drawn criticism from figures like Democratic Representative **Pramila Jayapal**, who warns of detrimental effects on global health, US soft power, and press freedom. Adding to the foreign policy shifts, the US Ambassador to Turkey, **Thomas Barrack**, announced a reduction of US military presence in **Syria** from eight bases to one. These actions collectively signal a significant, and contentious, policy direction impacting academic freedom, immigration, and America\\'s global engagement.\\n\\n<u>**UK Institutions Under Pressure: Financial Woes, Regulatory Failures, and Criminal Probes**</u>\\nSeveral prominent **UK** institutions are currently navigating a confluence of financial, regulatory, and even criminal challenges, painting a picture of systemic stress. The **Post Office**, still reeling from the **Horizon IT scandal**, is reportedly exploring asset sales or further borrowing to meet sub-postmasters\\' pay targets, with Chairman **Nigel Railton** highlighting uncertainty over government funding.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the future of **Thames Water**, the UK\\'s largest water utility, is increasingly precarious after US private equity firm **KKR** withdrew its rescue bid. The company requires massive investment to address failing infrastructure and persistent sewage spills. On the regulatory front, water regulator **Ofwat** has ordered **Northumbrian Water** to pay out **£15.7 million** for its network failings. Adding to the bleak landscape, **HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC)** admitted to a **£47 million loss** due to a sophisticated phishing scam that compromised around **100,000 taxpayer accounts**. HMRC executives **John-Paul Marks** and **Angela MacDonald** are managing the fallout, asserting taxpayers will suffer no financial loss. Finally, a deeply concerning police investigation has been launched into patient deaths following heart operations at **Castle Hill Hospital** in East Yorkshire, specifically focusing on Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) procedures. The case of **Dorothy Readhead**, who died in **2020** after a TAVI procedure, is central, with reports of conflicting mortality rate assessments between the **Humber Health Care Partnership** and independent reviews.\\n\\n<u>**Ukraine\\'s Deep Strike, Trump-Putin Dialogue, and Domestic Budget Discord**</u>\\n**Ukraine** executed a significant drone offensive, dubbed \\'Operation Spiderweb,\\' on **June 1, 2025**, targeting multiple **Russian** airbases. Kyiv claims substantial damage to Russian aircraft, including strategic cruise missile carriers, an operation reportedly 18 months in the planning involving smuggled drones. The **White House** confirmed **President Trump** had no prior knowledge of the attack. The Kremlin, while acknowledging the attack, downplayed its severity, a standard Russian response.\\n\\nThe strikes precipitated a lengthy phone call on **June 4** between **President Trump** and **Russian President Vladimir Putin**. During the conversation, **Putin** reportedly vowed that **Russia** would respond to the Ukrainian attacks, raising concerns about potential escalation and even nuclear rhetoric, which has been amplified by advisors in both Moscow and around **Trump**. Simultaneously, on the domestic front, **Trump** faces unexpected criticism from **Elon Musk**, who publicly decried the President\\'s latest budget bill as a \\'disgusting abomination\\' due to its impact on the deficit and debt ceiling. This spat, particularly Musk\\'s opposition to cuts in EV tax credits which would affect **Tesla**, exposes fissures within potential Republican-aligned circles and complicates the administration\\'s economic messaging, even as House Speaker **Mike Johnson** defends the bill.\\n\\n<u>**Gaza Aid Operations Suspended Amidst Deadly Incidents and Political Scrutiny**</u>\\nHumanitarian aid distribution in **Gaza** is in a state of crisis. The **Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF)**, a US-backed organization, suspended its operations on **June 4, 2025**, following deadly incidents where **Israeli forces (IDF)** reportedly fired on Palestinians seeking aid near GHF distribution sites. The **IDF** declared access roads to these sites \\'combat zones,\\' stating troops fired after \\'suspects\\' approached them in an endangering manner. Palestinian sources, including **Gaza\\'s Ministry of Health**, report significant casualties. The GHF, now led by newly appointed executive chairman **Johnnie Moore** (an evangelical Christian with ties to the **Trump** administration), initially stated it had no evidence of attacks *at* its facilities, a claim that sits uneasily with widespread reports of fatalities nearby.\\n\\nThe appointment of **Moore** and the GHF\\'s operational model have drawn criticism from other humanitarian organizations regarding its perceived lack of independence from **Israel**. This crisis unfolds against a backdrop of international pressure. In the **UK**, Parliament is debating a bill, championed by Independent MP **Jeremy Corbyn**, demanding an inquiry into Britain\\'s involvement in Israeli military operations and arms sales. Meanwhile, **Norway\\'s** parliament rejected a call to divest its massive sovereign wealth fund from companies linked to Israeli activities in occupied Palestinian territories, though Prime Minister **Jens Stoltenberg** affirmed adherence to an ethical regime that does divest from companies breaching international law. The situation underscores the immense difficulty of delivering aid in a conflict zone where military operations and humanitarian needs collide with tragic consequences.\\n\\n<u>**Arrest in Palm Springs Clinic Bombing: Anti-Natalist Terrorism Suspected**</u>\\nAn arrest has been made in connection with the **May 17, 2025, bombing** of the **American Reproductive Centers** fertility clinic in **Palm Springs, California**. **Daniel Park**, a 32-year-old US citizen from Kent, Washington, was apprehended at **JFK airport** in New York on **June 3**, after being deported from **Poland**.\\n\\nAuthorities, including US Attorney **Bill Essayli**, allege that **Park** provided material support to **Guy Edward Bartkus**, the individual believed to have carried out the bombing and who died in the blast. This support allegedly included shipping ammonium nitrate, a key bomb-making component, to **Bartkus**. Investigators believe the bombing was an act of terrorism motivated by anti-natalist views – an ideology opposing procreation. **Bartkus** reportedly left writings expressing opposition to bringing people into the world against their will. The clinic, a clear target for such an ideology, reopened at a new location about two weeks after the attack. The investigation continues, but this arrest marks a significant step in a disturbing case of ideologically motivated violence.\\n\\n## United Kingdom focus\\n\\n<u>**Greater Manchester Lands £2.5 Billion for \"Gamechanging\" Transport Overhaul**</u>\\n**Greater Manchester** has secured a **£2.5 billion** transport funding deal from the national government, a sum initially promised by former Prime Minister **Rishi Sunak** to compensate for the scrapped northern leg of **HS2**. The investment, announced by current Prime Minister **Keir Starmer**, is aimed at a significant expansion and modernization of the **Bee Network**, the region\\'s public transport system.\\n\\nKey projects include a long-awaited **Metrolink tram extension to Stockport**, the procurement of **1,000 new electric buses**, and the construction of new tram stops in **Manchester, Bury, and Oldham**. Mayor **Andy Burnham** hailed the deal as a \\'gamechanging moment,\\' envisioning the creation of the UK’s first fully electric, zero-emission integrated public transport system by **2030**. While there\\'s considerable local optimism, and **Burnham** is pushing for construction on the Stockport line to begin within the current Parliament, some skepticism remains regarding the timely delivery of these ambitious projects, given past unfulfilled promises in regional transport and the necessary Treasury approvals for specific business cases. Chancellor **Rachel Reeves** has indicated a shift away from Treasury rules that historically favored investment in London and the South East.\\n\\n<u>**Government Eases Winter Fuel Payment Cuts Amid Pension Reform Push**</u>\\nThe **UK government** has executed a partial reversal of its controversial decision to means-test **Winter Fuel Payments** for pensioners. Chancellor **Rachel Reeves** confirmed on **June 4, 2025**, that more pensioners will be eligible for the payment this winter due to an easing of the means test, which was previously tied strictly to **Pension Credit** eligibility. This U-turn follows political backlash against the initial cuts.\\n\\nHowever, Pensions Minister **Torsten Bell** clarified that there is \"no prospect\" of returning to a universal payment system, indicating the government remains committed to some form of targeting to avoid payments to higher-income individuals. The Winter Fuel Payment is worth between **£200 and £300**. Simultaneously, the government is advancing broader pension reforms through the **Pension Schemes Bill**, detailed on **June 5**. This legislation aims to consolidate numerous small pension pots, often accrued by workers changing jobs, into larger, potentially better-performing \\'megafunds\\' to improve retirement incomes. Work and Pensions Secretary **Liz Kendall** framed the bill as a move to secure better value for savers and drive investment in British businesses.\\n\\n## Global landscape\\n\\n<u>**Hurricane Season 2025: Coastal Risks, Insurance Woes, and Inland Preparedness**</u>\\nThe **2025 hurricane season** is officially underway, bringing with it stark warnings about escalating risks from wind damage and storm surge, particularly for coastal regions of the **United States**. A new report from **Cotality** indicates that **6.4 million U.S. homes** are at risk of storm surge, and a staggering **33.1 million** face potential wind damage. This heightened risk environment is contributing to rising insurance costs, which are beginning to impact coastal home sales.\\n\\nAuthorities are emphasizing comprehensive preparedness. In **Orange County, Florida**, officials are reminding residents to include pets in their emergency plans, highlighting \\'Trooper\\'s Law,\\' which criminalizes animal abandonment during declared disasters and goes into effect **October 1**. Meteorologists in inland areas like **East Texas** are also stressing the need for readiness, as hurricanes can bring heavy rain, flooding, and even tornadoes far from the coast, as demonstrated by **Hurricane Beryl** in **2024**. The focus is on proactive measures, from securing property to having evacuation plans that account for all family members, including animals.\\n\\n## Superpower monitor\\n\\n<u>**Biden\\'s Final Acts Under Scrutiny: Pardons, Cognitive State, and Autopen Use Probed**</u>\\nFormer **US President Joe Biden\\'s** final weeks in office, particularly his slew of pardons and questions surrounding his cognitive state, are now the subject of multiple investigations. **President Donald Trump** has ordered an inquiry, to be led by Attorney General **Pam Bondi**, into **Biden\\'s** alleged cognitive decline and the use of an autopen for signing official documents, including some pardons. This follows the **House Oversight Committee**, chaired by **James Comer**, expanding its own probe into these matters, requesting interviews with former senior **Biden** aides like **Ron Klain**.\\n\\nThe pardons in question, issued on **January 19, 2025**, included his son **Hunter Biden** (whom **Biden** had previously vowed not to pardon), former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. **Mark Milley**, Dr. **Anthony Fauci**, members of the **January 6th Committee**, and other family members. **Comer** has labeled the alleged cover-up of **Biden\\'s** mental state \"one of the greatest scandals in our nation’s history.\" **Biden** has refuted claims of cognitive decline, stating his memory is \"fine.\" While the use of autopens by presidents is not unprecedented (including during the **Trump** administration), the current investigations aim to determine if its use in **Biden\\'s** case was intended to mask incapacity, which **Trump** argues would constitute an \"unconstitutional wielding of the power of the Presidency.\" Both **Fauci** and **Milley** issued statements expressing gratitude for the pardons, citing politically motivated threats of investigation.\\n\\n## Economic currents\\n\\n<u>**Tech Giants Meta, Yandex, and Adidas Under Fire for Data Practices**</u>\\nMajor corporations **Meta** and **Yandex** are accused of employing covert methods to bypass **Android** privacy protections, enabling them to track user web browsing activity through their respective apps. Research published on **June 4, 2025**, detailed how these companies allegedly exploited local port communication to link web activity to app users, effectively circumventing **Android\\'s** sandboxing features. In response, **Meta** has paused the implicated tracking feature and is in discussions with **Google**, while **Yandex** stated it is discontinuing the practice. **Google** is investigating and has implemented some mitigations, condemning the techniques as violating its security and privacy principles.\\n\\nSeparately, German sportswear giant **Adidas** confirmed it suffered a data breach originating from a compromised third-party vendor. The breach exposed customer contact information, though **Adidas** asserts that no payment details or passwords were compromised. The company has begun notifying potentially affected customers. These incidents collectively underscore the persistent challenges in safeguarding user data. The **Meta/Yandex** case highlights sophisticated attempts to circumvent platform-level privacy controls, while the **Adidas** breach serves as another reminder of the vulnerabilities introduced by third-party dependencies in the corporate ecosystem. Regulatory scrutiny is likely to follow.\\n\\n## Tech & science developments\\n\\n<u>**AI Frontier: Navigating Hype, Ethical Quandaries, and Practical Hurdles**</u>\\nThe artificial intelligence landscape is a flurry of activity, marked by rapid advancements, significant corporate investment, and a growing chorus of concerns regarding ethics, security, and resource demands. While companies like **Huawei** claim breakthroughs in AI training methods using proprietary chips, and **AMC Networks** partners with AI startup **Runway** for marketing and development, a critical counter-narrative is also emerging. Experts like **Emily M. Bender** and **Alex Hanna** caution against the \"AGI hype,\" arguing it\\'s often driven by Big Tech\\'s commercial interests rather than genuine breakthroughs towards artificial general intelligence, a concept they deem ill-defined and potentially rooted in problematic biases.\\n\\nEthical considerations are paramount. The **American Psychological Association (APA)** has called for robust guardrails around AI use for young people, citing potential mental health risks. The **UK\\'s Investigatory Powers Commissioner\\'s Office (IPCO)** released an \"AI Proportionality Assessment Aid\" to guide police and intelligence agencies on the responsible use of AI, emphasizing privacy protection. Security is another major challenge, with CISOs urged to revamp data handling policies and secure AI development pipelines. Perhaps one of the most tangible hurdles is AI\\'s immense energy consumption. In a notable move, **Meta** recently secured a 20-year nuclear energy deal to power its AI data centers, highlighting the scale of the energy challenge and the search for stable, emissions-free power sources to fuel AI\\'s growth. Even historical research is being touched, with AI analysis suggesting the **Dead Sea Scrolls** may be older than previously thought.\\n\\n<u>**Nintendo Switch 2 Arrives: Iterative Upgrade Meets Cautious Consumer Interest**</u>\\n**Nintendo** launched its highly anticipated **Switch 2** console on **June 5, 2025**, priced at **$450**. According to a **CNET** survey conducted in **April**, **58%** of US gamers expressed interest in the new device, with **Gen Z** gamers showing even higher enthusiasm (**70%**). However, this interest is tempered by considerations of price and the availability of compelling new games.\\n\\nThe **Switch 2** offers several upgrades over its predecessor, including increased storage, a larger screen, and higher resolution. It maintains backward compatibility with original **Switch** games and introduces new features like **Game Chat** (which will require a **Nintendo Switch Online** subscription after **March 2026**) and Joy-Cons that can function like mice. Analysts like **CNET\\'s Scott Stein** view the **Switch 2** as an iterative improvement rather than a revolutionary leap, suggesting that while it\\'s a worthy upgrade, consumers might not need to rush out and buy it immediately. The console\\'s success will likely depend on its software lineup and its ability to justify the price point in a competitive market.\\n\\n<u>**Tablet and Phone Wars: Thin Designs, AI Integration, and Battery Life Dominate June 2025**</u>\\nThe mobile device market is buzzing with new releases and intensifying competition as **Apple, Samsung, Microsoft**, and **Google** jockey for position. A key trend is the pursuit of ultra-thin designs. **Samsung** has launched the **Galaxy S25 Edge**, a slimmer iteration of its **S25 Plus**. **Apple** is widely rumored to be developing an exceptionally thin **iPhone 17 Air**, potentially featuring a titanium-aluminium alloy frame, with an expected unveiling around **September 2025**. **Microsoft** has entered the fray with its **Surface Pro 12 (2025)**, a **Windows 11** tablet aiming to compete directly with **Apple\\'s iPad** offerings.\\n\\nAI integration is another dominant theme. **Google** is expected to heavily feature its **Gemini AI** in the upcoming **Pixel 10** series (anticipated in **August 2025**), powered by its new **Tensor G5** chip, reportedly manufactured by **TSMC**. **Microsoft** is also pushing AI with its **Copilot+ PCs**, such as the **Surface Laptop 7** and **Asus Zenbook A14**, which boast impressive battery life thanks to efficient **Qualcomm Snapdragon X** processors. Battery life remains a critical selling point across the board, even as devices become thinner. The recently released **Apple Watch Series 10** also features a larger, brighter screen, indicating continued refinement in wearables. This flurry of activity signals a market focused on incremental hardware improvements, deeper AI integration, and a constant push for sleeker form factors.\\n\\n## Noteworthy & under-reported\\n\\n<u>**Cancer Research Front: Breast Cancer Awareness, Sugar\\'s Colon Cancer Link, Ovarian Cancer Drug News**</u>\\nRecent developments in cancer research and awareness are drawing attention. Singer **Jessie J\\'s** announcement of her breast cancer diagnosis on **June 4, 2025**, and upcoming surgery has refocused public attention on the importance of self-checking and early detection. Organizations like the **NHS** and **CoppaFeel!** continue to emphasize regular breast examinations, as breast cancer remains a common malignancy in the **UK**.\\n\\nIn other research news, a study presented at the **American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)** meeting on **June 4** by **Dr. Emma Schatoff** of **Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center** suggests a potential link between high sugar consumption, particularly sugary drinks, and an increased risk of late-stage (de novo metastatic) colon cancer in young adults. This is particularly relevant given the observed rise in early-onset colon cancer since the 1990s. While the study requires further peer review and validation, it points to dietary factors as potential contributors. Separately, a brief report mentioned positive results for **Relacorilant** in treating platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, though more detailed information is pending.\\n\\n<u>**Madeleine McCann Search Reignited in Portugal; Separate Tragedy Sees British Tourist Found Deceased**</u>\\nThe long-running investigation into the disappearance of **Madeleine McCann** has seen renewed activity, with **Portuguese** and **German** police launching a fresh search in **Praia da Luz, Portugal**, on **June 3, 2025**. The search, utilizing ground-penetrating radar and involving excavation of derelict buildings, is focused on areas near the apartment where Madeleine vanished in **May 2007** and locations linked to prime suspect **Christian Brückner**. **Brückner**, a German national, is currently imprisoned for a rape committed in **Praia da Luz** in **2005**. The **Metropolitan Police** are aware of the search but not directly involved. Madeleine\\'s parents, **Kate and Gerry McCann**, maintain their unwavering determination to find answers.\\n\\nIn a separate and tragic development in the same Algarve region, the body of **Greg Monks**, a **29-year-old** British tourist from **Southport**, was found in a ravine near **Albufeira** on **June 4**. **Monks** had gone missing on **May 28** while on a stag party. The discovery has prompted an outpouring of grief and inevitable, though distinct, comparisons to the McCann case due to the location and the nationality of the individuals involved.\\n\\n<u>**Ex-White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre Ditches Democrats, Pens Critical Biden Book**</u>\\n**Karine Jean-Pierre**, who served as **White House Press Secretary** under former President **Joe Biden**, announced on **June 4, 2025**, that she is leaving the **Democratic Party** to register as an independent. This move coincides with the upcoming release of her book, \\'Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines,\\' scheduled for **October 21, 2025**.\\n\\nThe book reportedly delves into **Biden\\'s** decision not to seek reelection in **July 2024**—a decision allegedly influenced by pressure from **Democratic Party** leaders—and offers a critique of the party itself. **Jean-Pierre**, who left her White House role on **January 20, 2025**, states her book advocates for political independence and aims to dismantle disinformation. However, the book\\'s launch is already mired in controversy, with allegations reported by **Axios** reporter **Alex Thompson** that **Jean-Pierre** may have improperly worked with publicist **Gilda Squire** while still employed at the White House, a claim her team denies. This development promises further insider accounts and potential recriminations regarding the final phase of the **Biden** administration.\\n\\n<u>**Dietary Trends: Supplements for Kidney Stones, Planetary Health Diet, and Eye Nutrition Focus**</u>\\nRecent nutritional research highlights several emerging trends. A study presented at **NUTRITION 2025** on **June 4**, led by **Dr. Visith Thongboonkerd** from **Mahidol University, Thailand**, suggests that certain dietary supplements—including caffeine, EGCG (from green tea), NAC, resveratrol, and trigonelline—may inhibit the formation, growth, and aggregation of calcium oxalate kidney stones *in vitro*. While promising, researchers stress the need for further clinical validation before these can be prescribed.\\n\\nThe **Planetary Health Diet**, developed by the **EAT-Lancet Commission** in **2019**, continues to gain traction. Similar to the Mediterranean diet, it emphasizes plant-based foods (fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts) while allowing for moderate amounts of meat, fish, and dairy. Its dual goals are to improve human health and reduce the environmental impact of food production, a critical consideration for a growing global population. Critics, however, note potential challenges regarding cultural practicality, affordability, and nutritional adequacy for all. Separately, specific vitamins and supplements like Vitamins A, C, E, Omega-3 fatty acids, Zinc, Lutein, and Zeaxanthin are consistently highlighted for their roles in maintaining eye health and potentially reducing the risk of conditions like age-related macular degeneration. As always, consultation with a healthcare professional is advised before starting any new supplement regimen.\\n</brief>\\n\\nCreate a title for the brief. Construct it using the main topics.

Chinnaswamy Stadium** in **Bengaluru** resulted in at least **11 deaths** and dozens of injuries. The chaos erupted as an unexpectedly large crowd attempted to enter the stadium for the victory parade, leading to police employing a \\'lathi charge\\' (baton charge) to disperse them.\\n\\nThe **Karnataka state government**, led by Chief Minister **Siddaramaiah**, has expressed sadness and acknowledged the overwhelming crowd size. An investigation is undoubtedly underway, or will be shortly. The **Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)** termed the incident \\'unfortunate,\\' a rather mild assessment, and pointed to a need for better planning. This is a recurring issue in India, where large, passionate crowds and sometimes inadequate infrastructure or planning for such events can lead to tragic outcomes. The immediate focus is on treating the injured, transported to **Vydehi Multispecialty Hospital** and **Bowring Hospital**, but the long-term questions will revolve around accountability and preventative measures for future large-scale public gatherings, particularly high-stakes sporting events.\\n\\n<u>**South Korea Navigates Turmoil: Lee Jae-myung Takes Helm After Yoon\\'s Ouster**</u>\\n**Lee Jae-myung** has been inaugurated as the new President of **South Korea** on **June 4, 2025**, following a period of profound political upheaval. His predecessor, **Yoon Suk Yeol**, was impeached and removed from office earlier this year after his controversial declaration of martial law in **December 2024**. Lee secured **49.4%** of the vote in the subsequent snap election.\\n\\nLee faces a daunting array of challenges. The South Korean economy is under strain, partly due to the impact of **US tariffs** (a point of friction with the **Trump** administration). Persistent tensions with **North Korea** and its nuclear ambitions remain a primary security concern. Domestically, the political landscape is deeply fractured. Lee has pledged to prioritize economic recovery, seek dialogue with Pyongyang while enhancing the US alliance and trilateral cooperation with Japan, and foster national unity. However, his administration\\'s intention to investigate the circumstances surrounding Yoon\\'s martial law declaration could easily reignite political animosities. Yoon defended his actions as a response to the **Democratic Party\\'s** obstruction, a sentiment echoed by conservative candidate **Kim Moon-soo**. The situation underscores the fragility of democratic norms when political polarization reaches extreme levels.\\n\\n<u>**Canadian Wildfires: Evacuations Mount, Smoke Blankets Continents**</u>\\nCanada is grappling with a severe wildfire season, forcing over **33,000 evacuations**, primarily in **Manitoba** and **Saskatchewan**, where states of emergency are in effect. More than **200 wildfires** are burning, over half of them out of control. The scale of the evacuations in Manitoba is described by Premier **Wab Kinew** as the largest in the province\\'s recent history.\\n\\nThe impact extends far beyond Canadian borders. Smoke plumes are degrading air quality across the northern **United States**, particularly **New England**, with **New York City** issuing alerts. The smoke has even reportedly reached **Europe**. While some meteorological analyses suggest **NYC\\'s** poor air quality is a complex mix of factors including ground-level ozone exacerbated by warm, stagnant conditions, the wildfire smoke is undeniably a contributing factor to regional haze and health advisories. The Canadian government has requested international assistance to combat the blazes. This event highlights the cascading, transboundary effects of large-scale environmental disasters, increasingly linked to changing climate patterns.\\n\\n<u>**Trump Doubles Down: Steel and Aluminum Tariffs Hit 50%, Global Trade Braces**</u>\\nThe **Trump** administration escalated trade tensions on **June 4, 2025**, by increasing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to a significant **50%**. This move, ostensibly to protect and revitalize the **US steel industry**, has sent ripples of concern through global markets and drawn threats of retaliation.\\n\\nAllies are not amused. The **European Union** has voiced strong concern and is contemplating countermeasures. While the **United Kingdom** managed to secure a temporary \\'carve-out,\\' maintaining the original **25% tariff** for now, this is contingent on ongoing trade deal negotiations with the **US**, led by Prime Minister **Keir Starmer** and Trade Secretary **Jonathan Reynolds**. The deadline for the US to assess UK compliance is looming in early **July**. Simultaneously, **China** is tightening its control over critical mineral exports, a move that can be interpreted as a response to US trade pressures and an assertion of its dominance in these strategic supply chains. The tariffs will inevitably increase costs for industries reliant on these metals, with potential downstream effects on consumer prices for goods ranging from appliances to vehicles. The administration\\'s stance is that such pressure is necessary, particularly with the EU, which **Trump** described as \\'very difficult to deal with.\\'\\n\\n<u>**White House Escalates Pressure: Universities, Travel, and Foreign Aid in Crosshairs**</u>\\nThe **Trump** administration is intensifying its actions on multiple fronts, targeting universities, implementing a new travel ban, and seeking to slash foreign aid. **Harvard University** faces a six-month restriction on foreign student visas, signed by **President Trump** on **June 4**, following an earlier attempt by DHS Secretary **Kristi Noem** to revoke its **Student and Exchange Visitor Program** certification (temporarily blocked by a court). **Columbia University** is also under pressure, with its accreditor notified by the **Department of Education** of alleged anti-discrimination law violations. The administration cites concerns over antisemitism and foreign ties, particularly with **China**, as justification.\\n\\nConcurrently, a new travel ban restricting entry from **12 countries** and partially from **7 others** went into effect on **June 9**, framed as a national security imperative. Critics, however, are quick to label it a \\'Muslim ban,\\' echoing past controversies. Furthermore, **Trump** has formally requested Congress to rescind already approved funds for foreign aid, particularly impacting **USAID**, and public media. This move has drawn criticism from figures like Democratic Representative **Pramila Jayapal**, who warns of detrimental effects on global health, US soft power, and press freedom. Adding to the foreign policy shifts, the US Ambassador to Turkey, **Thomas Barrack**, announced a reduction of US military presence in **Syria** from eight bases to one. These actions collectively signal a significant, and contentious, policy direction impacting academic freedom, immigration, and America\\'s global engagement.\\n\\n<u>**UK Institutions Under Pressure: Financial Woes, Regulatory Failures, and Criminal Probes**</u>\\nSeveral prominent **UK** institutions are currently navigating a confluence of financial, regulatory, and even criminal challenges, painting a picture of systemic stress. The **Post Office**, still reeling from the **Horizon IT scandal**, is reportedly exploring asset sales or further borrowing to meet sub-postmasters\\' pay targets, with Chairman **Nigel Railton** highlighting uncertainty over government funding.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the future of **Thames Water**, the UK\\'s largest water utility, is increasingly precarious after US private equity firm **KKR** withdrew its rescue bid. The company requires massive investment to address failing infrastructure and persistent sewage spills. On the regulatory front, water regulator **Ofwat** has ordered **Northumbrian Water** to pay out **£15.7 million** for its network failings. Adding to the bleak landscape, **HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC)** admitted to a **£47 million loss** due to a sophisticated phishing scam that compromised around **100,000 taxpayer accounts**. HMRC executives **John-Paul Marks** and **Angela MacDonald** are managing the fallout, asserting taxpayers will suffer no financial loss. Finally, a deeply concerning police investigation has been launched into patient deaths following heart operations at **Castle Hill Hospital** in East Yorkshire, specifically focusing on Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) procedures. The case of **Dorothy Readhead**, who died in **2020** after a TAVI procedure, is central, with reports of conflicting mortality rate assessments between the **Humber Health Care Partnership** and independent reviews.\\n\\n<u>**Ukraine\\'s Deep Strike, Trump-Putin Dialogue, and Domestic Budget Discord**</u>\\n**Ukraine** executed a significant drone offensive, dubbed \\'Operation Spiderweb,\\' on **June 1, 2025**, targeting multiple **Russian** airbases. Kyiv claims substantial damage to Russian aircraft, including strategic cruise missile carriers, an operation reportedly 18 months in the planning involving smuggled drones. The **White House** confirmed **President Trump** had no prior knowledge of the attack. The Kremlin, while acknowledging the attack, downplayed its severity, a standard Russian response.\\n\\nThe strikes precipitated a lengthy phone call on **June 4** between **President Trump** and **Russian President Vladimir Putin**. During the conversation, **Putin** reportedly vowed that **Russia** would respond to the Ukrainian attacks, raising concerns about potential escalation and even nuclear rhetoric, which has been amplified by advisors in both Moscow and around **Trump**. Simultaneously, on the domestic front, **Trump** faces unexpected criticism from **Elon Musk**, who publicly decried the President\\'s latest budget bill as a \\'disgusting abomination\\' due to its impact on the deficit and debt ceiling. This spat, particularly Musk\\'s opposition to cuts in EV tax credits which would affect **Tesla**, exposes fissures within potential Republican-aligned circles and complicates the administration\\'s economic messaging, even as House Speaker **Mike Johnson** defends the bill.\\n\\n<u>**Gaza Aid Operations Suspended Amidst Deadly Incidents and Political Scrutiny**</u>\\nHumanitarian aid distribution in **Gaza** is in a state of crisis. The **Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF)**, a US-backed organization, suspended its operations on **June 4, 2025**, following deadly incidents where **Israeli forces (IDF)** reportedly fired on Palestinians seeking aid near GHF distribution sites. The **IDF** declared access roads to these sites \\'combat zones,\\' stating troops fired after \\'suspects\\' approached them in an endangering manner. Palestinian sources, including **Gaza\\'s Ministry of Health**, report significant casualties. The GHF, now led by newly appointed executive chairman **Johnnie Moore** (an evangelical Christian with ties to the **Trump** administration), initially stated it had no evidence of attacks *at* its facilities, a claim that sits uneasily with widespread reports of fatalities nearby.\\n\\nThe appointment of **Moore** and the GHF\\'s operational model have drawn criticism from other humanitarian organizations regarding its perceived lack of independence from **Israel**. This crisis unfolds against a backdrop of international pressure. In the **UK**, Parliament is debating a bill, championed by Independent MP **Jeremy Corbyn**, demanding an inquiry into Britain\\'s involvement in Israeli military operations and arms sales. Meanwhile, **Norway\\'s** parliament rejected a call to divest its massive sovereign wealth fund from companies linked to Israeli activities in occupied Palestinian territories, though Prime Minister **Jens Stoltenberg** affirmed adherence to an ethical regime that does divest from companies breaching international law. The situation underscores the immense difficulty of delivering aid in a conflict zone where military operations and humanitarian needs collide with tragic consequences.\\n\\n<u>**Arrest in Palm Springs Clinic Bombing: Anti-Natalist Terrorism Suspected**</u>\\nAn arrest has been made in connection with the **May 17, 2025, bombing** of the **American Reproductive Centers** fertility clinic in **Palm Springs, California**. **Daniel Park**, a 32-year-old US citizen from Kent, Washington, was apprehended at **JFK airport** in New York on **June 3**, after being deported from **Poland**.\\n\\nAuthorities, including US Attorney **Bill Essayli**, allege that **Park** provided material support to **Guy Edward Bartkus**, the individual believed to have carried out the bombing and who died in the blast. This support allegedly included shipping ammonium nitrate, a key bomb-making component, to **Bartkus**. Investigators believe the bombing was an act of terrorism motivated by anti-natalist views – an ideology opposing procreation. **Bartkus** reportedly left writings expressing opposition to bringing people into the world against their will. The clinic, a clear target for such an ideology, reopened at a new location about two weeks after the attack. The investigation continues, but this arrest marks a significant step in a disturbing case of ideologically motivated violence.\\n\\n## United Kingdom focus\\n\\n<u>**Greater Manchester Lands £2.5 Billion for \"Gamechanging\" Transport Overhaul**</u>\\n**Greater Manchester** has secured a **£2.5 billion** transport funding deal from the national government, a sum initially promised by former Prime Minister **Rishi Sunak** to compensate for the scrapped northern leg of **HS2**. The investment, announced by current Prime Minister **Keir Starmer**, is aimed at a significant expansion and modernization of the **Bee Network**, the region\\'s public transport system.\\n\\nKey projects include a long-awaited **Metrolink tram extension to Stockport**, the procurement of **1,000 new electric buses**, and the construction of new tram stops in **Manchester, Bury, and Oldham**. Mayor **Andy Burnham** hailed the deal as a \\'gamechanging moment,\\' envisioning the creation of the UK’s first fully electric, zero-emission integrated public transport system by **2030**. While there\\'s considerable local optimism, and **Burnham** is pushing for construction on the Stockport line to begin within the current Parliament, some skepticism remains regarding the timely delivery of these ambitious projects, given past unfulfilled promises in regional transport and the necessary Treasury approvals for specific business cases. Chancellor **Rachel Reeves** has indicated a shift away from Treasury rules that historically favored investment in London and the South East.\\n\\n<u>**Government Eases Winter Fuel Payment Cuts Amid Pension Reform Push**</u>\\nThe **UK government** has executed a partial reversal of its controversial decision to means-test **Winter Fuel Payments** for pensioners. Chancellor **Rachel Reeves** confirmed on **June 4, 2025**, that more pensioners will be eligible for the payment this winter due to an easing of the means test, which was previously tied strictly to **Pension Credit** eligibility. This U-turn follows political backlash against the initial cuts.\\n\\nHowever, Pensions Minister **Torsten Bell** clarified that there is \"no prospect\" of returning to a universal payment system, indicating the government remains committed to some form of targeting to avoid payments to higher-income individuals. The Winter Fuel Payment is worth between **£200 and £300**. Simultaneously, the government is advancing broader pension reforms through the **Pension Schemes Bill**, detailed on **June 5**. This legislation aims to consolidate numerous small pension pots, often accrued by workers changing jobs, into larger, potentially better-performing \\'megafunds\\' to improve retirement incomes. Work and Pensions Secretary **Liz Kendall** framed the bill as a move to secure better value for savers and drive investment in British businesses.\\n\\n## Global landscape\\n\\n<u>**Hurricane Season 2025: Coastal Risks, Insurance Woes, and Inland Preparedness**</u>\\nThe **2025 hurricane season** is officially underway, bringing with it stark warnings about escalating risks from wind damage and storm surge, particularly for coastal regions of the **United States**. A new report from **Cotality** indicates that **6.4 million U.S. homes** are at risk of storm surge, and a staggering **33.1 million** face potential wind damage. This heightened risk environment is contributing to rising insurance costs, which are beginning to impact coastal home sales.\\n\\nAuthorities are emphasizing comprehensive preparedness. In **Orange County, Florida**, officials are reminding residents to include pets in their emergency plans, highlighting \\'Trooper\\'s Law,\\' which criminalizes animal abandonment during declared disasters and goes into effect **October 1**. Meteorologists in inland areas like **East Texas** are also stressing the need for readiness, as hurricanes can bring heavy rain, flooding, and even tornadoes far from the coast, as demonstrated by **Hurricane Beryl** in **2024**. The focus is on proactive measures, from securing property to having evacuation plans that account for all family members, including animals.\\n\\n## Superpower monitor\\n\\n<u>**Biden\\'s Final Acts Under Scrutiny: Pardons, Cognitive State, and Autopen Use Probed**</u>\\nFormer **US President Joe Biden\\'s** final weeks in office, particularly his slew of pardons and questions surrounding his cognitive state, are now the subject of multiple investigations. **President Donald Trump** has ordered an inquiry, to be led by Attorney General **Pam Bondi**, into **Biden\\'s** alleged cognitive decline and the use of an autopen for signing official documents, including some pardons. This follows the **House Oversight Committee**, chaired by **James Comer**, expanding its own probe into these matters, requesting interviews with former senior **Biden** aides like **Ron Klain**.\\n\\nThe pardons in question, issued on **January 19, 2025**, included his son **Hunter Biden** (whom **Biden** had previously vowed not to pardon), former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. **Mark Milley**, Dr. **Anthony Fauci**, members of the **January 6th Committee**, and other family members. **Comer** has labeled the alleged cover-up of **Biden\\'s** mental state \"one of the greatest scandals in our nation’s history.\" **Biden** has refuted claims of cognitive decline, stating his memory is \"fine.\" While the use of autopens by presidents is not unprecedented (including during the **Trump** administration), the current investigations aim to determine if its use in **Biden\\'s** case was intended to mask incapacity, which **Trump** argues would constitute an \"unconstitutional wielding of the power of the Presidency.\" Both **Fauci** and **Milley** issued statements expressing gratitude for the pardons, citing politically motivated threats of investigation.\\n\\n## Economic currents\\n\\n<u>**Tech Giants Meta, Yandex, and Adidas Under Fire for Data Practices**</u>\\nMajor corporations **Meta** and **Yandex** are accused of employing covert methods to bypass **Android** privacy protections, enabling them to track user web browsing activity through their respective apps. Research published on **June 4, 2025**, detailed how these companies allegedly exploited local port communication to link web activity to app users, effectively circumventing **Android\\'s** sandboxing features. In response, **Meta** has paused the implicated tracking feature and is in discussions with **Google**, while **Yandex** stated it is discontinuing the practice. **Google** is investigating and has implemented some mitigations, condemning the techniques as violating its security and privacy principles.\\n\\nSeparately, German sportswear giant **Adidas** confirmed it suffered a data breach originating from a compromised third-party vendor. The breach exposed customer contact information, though **Adidas** asserts that no payment details or passwords were compromised. The company has begun notifying potentially affected customers. These incidents collectively underscore the persistent challenges in safeguarding user data. The **Meta/Yandex** case highlights sophisticated attempts to circumvent platform-level privacy controls, while the **Adidas** breach serves as another reminder of the vulnerabilities introduced by third-party dependencies in the corporate ecosystem. Regulatory scrutiny is likely to follow.\\n\\n## Tech & science developments\\n\\n<u>**AI Frontier: Navigating Hype, Ethical Quandaries, and Practical Hurdles**</u>\\nThe artificial intelligence landscape is a flurry of activity, marked by rapid advancements, significant corporate investment, and a growing chorus of concerns regarding ethics, security, and resource demands. While companies like **Huawei** claim breakthroughs in AI training methods using proprietary chips, and **AMC Networks** partners with AI startup **Runway** for marketing and development, a critical counter-narrative is also emerging. Experts like **Emily M. Bender** and **Alex Hanna** caution against the \"AGI hype,\" arguing it\\'s often driven by Big Tech\\'s commercial interests rather than genuine breakthroughs towards artificial general intelligence, a concept they deem ill-defined and potentially rooted in problematic biases.\\n\\nEthical considerations are paramount. The **American Psychological Association (APA)** has called for robust guardrails around AI use for young people, citing potential mental health risks. The **UK\\'s Investigatory Powers Commissioner\\'s Office (IPCO)** released an \"AI Proportionality Assessment Aid\" to guide police and intelligence agencies on the responsible use of AI, emphasizing privacy protection. Security is another major challenge, with CISOs urged to revamp data handling policies and secure AI development pipelines. Perhaps one of the most tangible hurdles is AI\\'s immense energy consumption. In a notable move, **Meta** recently secured a 20-year nuclear energy deal to power its AI data centers, highlighting the scale of the energy challenge and the search for stable, emissions-free power sources to fuel AI\\'s growth. Even historical research is being touched, with AI analysis suggesting the **Dead Sea Scrolls** may be older than previously thought.\\n\\n<u>**Nintendo Switch 2 Arrives: Iterative Upgrade Meets Cautious Consumer Interest**</u>\\n**Nintendo** launched its highly anticipated **Switch 2** console on **June 5, 2025**, priced at **$450**. According to a **CNET** survey conducted in **April**, **58%** of US gamers expressed interest in the new device, with **Gen Z** gamers showing even higher enthusiasm (**70%**). However, this interest is tempered by considerations of price and the availability of compelling new games.\\n\\nThe **Switch 2** offers several upgrades over its predecessor, including increased storage, a larger screen, and higher resolution. It maintains backward compatibility with original **Switch** games and introduces new features like **Game Chat** (which will require a **Nintendo Switch Online** subscription after **March 2026**) and Joy-Cons that can function like mice. Analysts like **CNET\\'s Scott Stein** view the **Switch 2** as an iterative improvement rather than a revolutionary leap, suggesting that while it\\'s a worthy upgrade, consumers might not need to rush out and buy it immediately. The console\\'s success will likely depend on its software lineup and its ability to justify the price point in a competitive market.\\n\\n<u>**Tablet and Phone Wars: Thin Designs, AI Integration, and Battery Life Dominate June 2025**</u>\\nThe mobile device market is buzzing with new releases and intensifying competition as **Apple, Samsung, Microsoft**, and **Google** jockey for position. A key trend is the pursuit of ultra-thin designs. **Samsung** has launched the **Galaxy S25 Edge**, a slimmer iteration of its **S25 Plus**. **Apple** is widely rumored to be developing an exceptionally thin **iPhone 17 Air**, potentially featuring a titanium-aluminium alloy frame, with an expected unveiling around **September 2025**. **Microsoft** has entered the fray with its **Surface Pro 12 (2025)**, a **Windows 11** tablet aiming to compete directly with **Apple\\'s iPad** offerings.\\n\\nAI integration is another dominant theme. **Google** is expected to heavily feature its **Gemini AI** in the upcoming **Pixel 10** series (anticipated in **August 2025**), powered by its new **Tensor G5** chip, reportedly manufactured by **TSMC**. **Microsoft** is also pushing AI with its **Copilot+ PCs**, such as the **Surface Laptop 7** and **Asus Zenbook A14**, which boast impressive battery life thanks to efficient **Qualcomm Snapdragon X** processors. Battery life remains a critical selling point across the board, even as devices become thinner. The recently released **Apple Watch Series 10** also features a larger, brighter screen, indicating continued refinement in wearables. This flurry of activity signals a market focused on incremental hardware improvements, deeper AI integration, and a constant push for sleeker form factors.\\n\\n## Noteworthy & under-reported\\n\\n<u>**Cancer Research Front: Breast Cancer Awareness, Sugar\\'s Colon Cancer Link, Ovarian Cancer Drug News**</u>\\nRecent developments in cancer research and awareness are drawing attention. Singer **Jessie J\\'s** announcement of her breast cancer diagnosis on **June 4, 2025**, and upcoming surgery has refocused public attention on the importance of self-checking and early detection. Organizations like the **NHS** and **CoppaFeel!** continue to emphasize regular breast examinations, as breast cancer remains a common malignancy in the **UK**.\\n\\nIn other research news, a study presented at the **American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)** meeting on **June 4** by **Dr. Emma Schatoff** of **Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center** suggests a potential link between high sugar consumption, particularly sugary drinks, and an increased risk of late-stage (de novo metastatic) colon cancer in young adults. This is particularly relevant given the observed rise in early-onset colon cancer since the 1990s. While the study requires further peer review and validation, it points to dietary factors as potential contributors. Separately, a brief report mentioned positive results for **Relacorilant** in treating platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, though more detailed information is pending.\\n\\n<u>**Madeleine McCann Search Reignited in Portugal; Separate Tragedy Sees British Tourist Found Deceased**</u>\\nThe long-running investigation into the disappearance of **Madeleine McCann** has seen renewed activity, with **Portuguese** and **German** police launching a fresh search in **Praia da Luz, Portugal**, on **June 3, 2025**. The search, utilizing ground-penetrating radar and involving excavation of derelict buildings, is focused on areas near the apartment where Madeleine vanished in **May 2007** and locations linked to prime suspect **Christian Brückner**. **Brückner**, a German national, is currently imprisoned for a rape committed in **Praia da Luz** in **2005**. The **Metropolitan Police** are aware of the search but not directly involved. Madeleine\\'s parents, **Kate and Gerry McCann**, maintain their unwavering determination to find answers.\\n\\nIn a separate and tragic development in the same Algarve region, the body of **Greg Monks**, a **29-year-old** British tourist from **Southport**, was found in a ravine near **Albufeira** on **June 4**. **Monks** had gone missing on **May 28** while on a stag party. The discovery has prompted an outpouring of grief and inevitable, though distinct, comparisons to the McCann case due to the location and the nationality of the individuals involved.\\n\\n<u>**Ex-White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre Ditches Democrats, Pens Critical Biden Book**</u>\\n**Karine Jean-Pierre**, who served as **White House Press Secretary** under former President **Joe Biden**, announced on **June 4, 2025**, that she is leaving the **Democratic Party** to register as an independent. This move coincides with the upcoming release of her book, \\'Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines,\\' scheduled for **October 21, 2025**.\\n\\nThe book reportedly delves into **Biden\\'s** decision not to seek reelection in **July 2024**—a decision allegedly influenced by pressure from **Democratic Party** leaders—and offers a critique of the party itself. **Jean-Pierre**, who left her White House role on **January 20, 2025**, states her book advocates for political independence and aims to dismantle disinformation. However, the book\\'s launch is already mired in controversy, with allegations reported by **Axios** reporter **Alex Thompson** that **Jean-Pierre** may have improperly worked with publicist **Gilda Squire** while still employed at the White House, a claim her team denies. This development promises further insider accounts and potential recriminations regarding the final phase of the **Biden** administration.\\n\\n<u>**Dietary Trends: Supplements for Kidney Stones, Planetary Health Diet, and Eye Nutrition Focus**</u>\\nRecent nutritional research highlights several emerging trends. A study presented at **NUTRITION 2025** on **June 4**, led by **Dr. Visith Thongboonkerd** from **Mahidol University, Thailand**, suggests that certain dietary supplements—including caffeine, EGCG (from green tea), NAC, resveratrol, and trigonelline—may inhibit the formation, growth, and aggregation of calcium oxalate kidney stones *in vitro*. While promising, researchers stress the need for further clinical validation before these can be prescribed.\\n\\nThe **Planetary Health Diet**, developed by the **EAT-Lancet Commission** in **2019**, continues to gain traction. Similar to the Mediterranean diet, it emphasizes plant-based foods (fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts) while allowing for moderate amounts of meat, fish, and dairy. Its dual goals are to improve human health and reduce the environmental impact of food production, a critical consideration for a growing global population. Critics, however, note potential challenges regarding cultural practicality, affordability, and nutritional adequacy for all. Separately, specific vitamins and supplements like Vitamins A, C, E, Omega-3 fatty acids, Zinc, Lutein, and Zeaxanthin are consistently highlighted for their roles in maintaining eye health and potentially reducing the risk of conditions like age-related macular degeneration. As always, consultation with a healthcare professional is advised before starting any new supplement regimen.\\n</final_brief>\\n\\n**Required Output Format:**\\n\\nYour entire output must consist **only** of a list of summaries, one for each identified major story.

      "\n",
      "<u>**Bengaluru IPL Celebrations End in Tragedy as Stampede Claims Lives**</u>\n",
      "Celebrations for **Royal Challengers Bengaluru's (RCB)** Indian Premier League (IPL) victory turned deadly on **June 4, 2025**, when a stampede outside **M. Chinnaswamy Stadium** in **Bengaluru** resulted in at least **11 deaths** and dozens of injuries. The chaos erupted as an unexpectedly large crowd attempted to enter the stadium for the victory parade, leading to police employing a 'lathi charge' (baton charge) to disperse them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The **Karnataka state government**, led by Chief Minister **Siddaramaiah**, has expressed sadness and acknowledged the overwhelming crowd size. An investigation is undoubtedly underway, or will be shortly. The **Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)** termed the incident 'unfortunate,' a rather mild assessment, and pointed to a need for better planning. This is a recurring issue in India, where large, passionate crowds and sometimes inadequate infrastructure or planning for such events can lead to tragic outcomes. The immediate focus is on treating the injured, transported to **Vydehi Multispecialty Hospital** and **Bowring Hospital**, but the long-term questions will revolve around accountability and preventative measures for future large-scale public gatherings, particularly high-stakes sporting events.\n",
      "\n",
      "<u>**South Korea Navigates Turmoil: Lee Jae-myung Takes Helm After Yoon's Ouster**</u>\n",
      "**Lee Jae-myung** has been inaugurated as the new President of **South Korea** on **June 4, 2025**, following a period of profound political upheaval. His predecessor, **Yoon Suk Yeol**, was impeached and removed from office earlier this year after his controversial declaration of martial law in **December 2024**. Lee secured **49.4%** of the vote in the subsequent snap election.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lee faces a daunting array of challenges. The South Korean economy is under strain, partly due to the impact of **US tariffs** (a point of friction with the **Trump** administration). Persistent tensions with **North Korea** and its nuclear ambitions remain a primary security concern. Domestically, the political landscape is deeply fractured. Lee has pledged to prioritize economic recovery, seek dialogue with Pyongyang while enhancing the US alliance and trilateral cooperation with Japan, and foster national unity. However, his administration's intention to investigate the circumstances surrounding Yoon's martial law declaration could easily reignite political animosities. Yoon defended his actions as a response to the **Democratic Party's** obstruction, a sentiment echoed by conservative candidate **Kim Moon-soo**. The situation underscores the fragility of democratic norms when political polarization reaches extreme levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "<u>**Canadian Wildfires: Evacuations Mount, Smoke Blankets Continents**</u>\n",
      "Canada is grappling with a severe wildfire season, forcing over **33,000 evacuations**, primarily in **Manitoba** and **Saskatchewan**, where states of emergency are in effect. More than **200 wildfires** are burning, over half of them out of control. The scale of the evacuations in Manitoba is described by Premier **Wab Kinew** as the largest in the province's recent history.\n",
      "\n",
      "The impact extends far beyond Canadian borders. Smoke plumes are degrading air quality across the northern **United States**, particularly **New England**, with **New York City** issuing alerts. The smoke has even reportedly reached **Europe**. While some meteorological analyses suggest **NYC's** poor air quality is a complex mix of factors including ground-level ozone exacerbated by warm, stagnant conditions, the wildfire smoke is undeniably a contributing factor to regional haze and health advisories. The Canadian government has requested international assistance to combat the blazes. This event highlights the cascading, transboundary effects of large-scale environmental disasters, increasingly linked to changing climate patterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "<u>**Trump Doubles Down: Steel and Aluminum Tariffs Hit 50%, Global Trade Braces**</u>\n",
      "The **Trump** administration escalated trade tensions on **June 4, 2025**, by increasing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to a significant **50%**. This move, ostensibly to protect and revitalize the **US steel industry**, has sent ripples of concern through global markets and drawn threats of retaliation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Allies are not amused. The **European Union** has voiced strong concern and is contemplating countermeasures. While the **United Kingdom** managed to secure a temporary 'carve-out,' maintaining the original **25% tariff** for now, this is contingent on ongoing trade deal negotiations with the **US**, led by Prime Minister **Keir Starmer** and Trade Secretary **Jonathan Reynolds**. The deadline for the US to assess UK compliance is looming in early **July**. Simultaneously, **China** is tightening its control over critical mineral exports, a move that can be interpreted as a response to US trade pressures and an assertion of its dominance in these strategic supply chains. The tariffs will inevitably increase costs for industries reliant on these metals, with potential downstream effects on consumer prices for goods ranging from appliances to vehicles. The administration's stance is that such pressure is necessary, particularly with the EU, which **Trump** described as 'very difficult to deal with.'\n",

      "Concurrently, a new travel ban restricting entry from **12 countries** and partially from **7 others** went into effect on **June 9**, framed as a national security imperative. Critics, however, are quick to label it a 'Muslim ban,' echoing past controversies. Furthermore, **Trump** has formally requested Congress to rescind already approved funds for foreign aid, particularly impacting **USAID**, and public media. This move has drawn criticism from figures like Democratic Representative **Pramila Jayapal**, who warns of detrimental effects on global health, US soft power, and press freedom. Adding to the foreign policy shifts, the US Ambassador to Turkey, **Thomas Barrack**, announced a reduction of US military presence in **Syria** from eight bases to one.

Kyiv claims substantial damage to Russian aircraft, including strategic cruise missile carriers, an operation reportedly 18 months in the planning involving smuggled drones. The **White House** confirmed **President Trump** had no prior knowledge of the attack. The Kremlin, while acknowledging the attack, downplayed its severity, a standard Russian response.\n",

During the conversation, **Putin** reportedly vowed that **Russia** would respond to the Ukrainian attacks, raising concerns about potential escalation and even nuclear rhetoric, which has been amplified by advisors in both Moscow and around **Trump**. Simultaneously, on the domestic front, **Trump** faces unexpected criticism from **Elon Musk**, who publicly decried the President's latest budget bill as a 'disgusting abomination' due to its impact on the deficit and debt ceiling.

Meanwhile, **Norway's** parliament rejected a call to divest its massive sovereign wealth fund from companies linked to Israeli activities in occupied Palestinian territories, though Prime Minister **Jens Stoltenberg** affirmed adherence to an ethical regime that does divest from companies breaching international law.

This support allegedly included shipping ammonium nitrate, a key bomb-making component, to **Bartkus**. Investigators believe the bombing was an act of terrorism motivated by anti-natalist views – an ideology opposing procreation. **Bartkus** reportedly left writings expressing opposition to bringing people into the world against their will. The clinic, a clear target for such an ideology, reopened at a new location about two weeks after the attack.

      "However, Pensions Minister **Torsten Bell** clarified that there is \"no prospect\" of returning to a universal payment system, indicating the government remains committed to some form of targeting to avoid payments to higher-income individuals. The Winter Fuel Payment is worth between **£200 and £300**. Simultaneously, the government is advancing broader pension reforms through the **Pension Schemes Bill**, detailed on **June 5**.
