They also cited a confession they say he penned “To the feds,” in which he wrote that “it had to be done.”Mangione’s lawyers want the state case thrown out, arguing in court papers that those charges and a parallel federal death penalty case amount to double jeopardy.They also want state terrorism charges dismissed, have asked for the federal case to go first and say prosecutors should be barred from using evidence collected during Mangione’s arrest, including a 9mm handgun, statements to police and the diary.Manhattan prosecutors contend that there are no double jeopardy issues because neither case has gone to trial and because the state and federal prosecutions involve different legal theories. His lawyers say that has created a “legal quagmire” that makes it “legally and logistically impossible to defend against them simultaneously.”The state charges, which carry a maximum of life in prison, allege that Mangione wanted to “intimidate or coerce a civilian population,” that is, insurance employees and investors. The federal charges allege that Mangione stalked an individual, Thompson, and do not involve terror allegations.Mangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty in both cases. No trial dates have been set.Mangione’s “intentions were obvious from his acts, but his writings serve to make those intentions explicit,” prosecutors said in Wednesday’s filing. The writings, which they sometimes described as a manifesto, “convey one clear message: that the murder of Brian Thompson was intended to bring about revolutionary change to the healthcare industry.”They quoted excerpts in which Mangione discussed options for the attack, such as bombing UnitedHealthcare’s headquarters, before deciding to target the company's investor conference in Manhattan. He wrote about plans to “wack the CEO at the annual parasitic bean-counter convention” because it was “targeted, precise and doesn’t risk innocents.”UnitedHealthcare, the largest U.S. health insurer, “literally extracts human life force for money,” Mangione wrote, envisioning the news headline, “Insurance CEO killed at annual investors conference.” The company has said he was never a client.Mangione is due back in state court June 26, when Judge Gregory Carro is expected to rule on his request for dismissal. His lawyers asked Tuesday for his handcuffs and bulletproof vest to be removed during the hearing. They called him a “a model prisoner, a model defendant” and said the security measures would suggest to potential jurors that he is dangerous. Carro has not ruled on that.Mangione’s next federal court date is Dec. 5, a day after the one-year anniversary of Thompson’s death. Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting Thompson from behind as he arrived for the conference Dec. 4 at the New York Hilton Midtown. Police say “delay,” “deny” and “depose” were scrawled on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase commonly used to describe how insurers avoid paying claims.Mangione was arrested Dec. 9 at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, 230 miles (about 370 kilometers) to the west, and he is being held in a federal jail in Brooklyn.Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has called the ambush “a killing that was intended to evoke terror.”U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced in April that she was directing federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty for “an act of political violence” and a “premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America.”The killing and ensuing search for Mangione rattled the business community while galvanizing health insurance critics who rallied around him as a stand-in for frustrations over coverage denials and hefty bills. Supporters have flocked to his court appearances and flooded him with mail.Mangione “demonstrated in his manifesto that he was a revolutionary anarchist who would usher in a better healthcare system by killing the CEO” of one of the biggest U.S. companies, prosecutors wrote. “This brutal, cowardly murder was the mechanism that defendant chose to bring on that revolution.”\", 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: UnitedHealthcare CEO Killing: Suspect's Motive Revealed\\nENTITIES: Luigi Mangione, Brian Thompson, UnitedHealthcare, Alvin Bragg, Pam Bondi\\nEVENT: Luigi Mangione is accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

He was 76. Members of Parliament rose for a moment of silence in the House of Commons Wednesday evening at the request of government lawmaker Mark Gerretsen.An electrical engineer and former Royal Canadian Navy officer, he became the first Canadian in space when he flew aboard the U.S. space shuttle in 1984. Garneau made two other trips to space. “It is with deep sadness that I share the news of my husband Marc Garneau’s passing. Marc faced his final days with the same strength, clarity, and grace that defined his life. He passed away peacefully, surrounded by the love of his family,” Pam Garneau said in a statement. “We wish to express our heartfelt thanks for the outpouring of support, concern, and kind words received over the past few days. We are especially grateful to the medical team who provided such dedicated and compassionate care during his short illness.\"A cause of death was not provided. Garneau served in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\\'s government as minister of foreign affairs and transport minister. He was a Liberal member of Parliament for a Montreal-area riding between 2008 and 2023.“I join all Canadians in mourning the passing of Marc Garneau,” Carney said in a statement. “A naval officer, a history-making astronaut, and a public servant of exceptional distinction ... May we all remember him for the national pride and possibility he represented to all of us.”Former prime minister Trudeau said on social media that it was with “much sadness” that he had learned about Garneau’s passing.“I first met Marc as a schoolboy in the early 1980s,” Trudeau said. “I was in awe of his service and his courage then, and continued to be as I had the privilege to serve alongside him in Parliament and in government. Marc truly embodied and exemplified Canadian greatness throughout his whole life.”Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield said Garneau was his role model, mentor, longtime friend and “a brave and exemplary Canadian for us all.”Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne said Garneau “exceeded every expectation.”Garneau said in a recent interview that his three flights changed the way he saw Earth.“When you see that thin atmosphere and realize we’re filling it with greenhouse gases and pollutants ...when you see these things, you realize, ‘What are we doing?’” he said in 2024. “If we don’t take care of this planet, there is nowhere else to go.”Garneau said that, after flying in space, life was “not as intimidating.”“It gave me a sense of confidence and it gave me confidence to move forward in life instead of playing it safe,” he said.Garneau was born in Quebec City and earned a bachelor of science degree in engineering physics at the Royal Military College in Kingston, Ontario.There are a number of schools named after him in Canada.

She is anxious and worried after her immigration lawyer advised against leaving the country for the summer due to the recent border control policies for international students.\\nOn 27 May, the State Department instructed United States embassies around the world to temporarily pause scheduling new student visa appointments, as the Trump administration seeks to expand social media screenings for applicants, the latest in a string of restrictions targeting international students.\\n“It’s been very turbulent, and equally terrifying with each development that comes,” Mahmoud told Al Jazeera, speaking from her college dormitory in Washington, DC.\\nMahmoud isn’t alone in feeling this way. Many other international students say they feel they need to stay under the radar, afraid that even a small issue could get them deported.\\n1.1 million international students\\nAccording to NAFSA, a US nonprofit organisation that focuses on international education and student exchange, over the 2023/2024 academic year there were just more than 1.1 million international students studying in the US.\\nThese international students made up 5.6 percent of the nearly 19 million total higher education students across the US.\\nTogether, students from India and China made up 54 percent of the total, with India leading at 331,602 (29 percent) and China at 277,398 (25 percent).\\n‘Major loss for the United States’\\nFanta Aw, executive director and CEO of NAFSA, who is herself a former international student, says she knows on a personal and professional level how important the cultural exchange between international students and local communities is, especially in today’s hyper connected world.\\n“I think this is a major loss for the United States; other countries will open their doors and they are already welcoming students,” Aw told Al Jazeera.\\n“Students want certainty. They want consistency. And they want to know that the system works. And if they continue to see action after action, they’re already losing trust,” she adds.\\n“Once you continue down this road, you will have years to recover from this, and you may never recover from it. Because by then, more other countries are competing for these same students.”\\n“We’re seeing Germany. We’re seeing Japan. We’re seeing South Korea. Malaysia has always been a destination for students. The Middle East, with all of the American-style universities – this is what the US is competing with.”\\nWhere are international students studying?\\nAlthough many international students are concentrated at major universities on the East and West coasts, a sizeable number also study at prominent universities in the Midwest and other parts of the US.\\nAccording to data compiled by Open Doors, during the 2023/2024 academic year, New York City hosted the largest number of international students, with 27,247 at New York University and 20,321 at Columbia University. Northeastern University in Boston follows, with 21,023 international students.\\nOne such student headed to the Midwest is Noor Ali*, a 23-year-old from Karachi, Pakistan, who is embarking on her masters in journalism on a full scholarship from the university.\\nAli has requested her identity be concealed and her institution not be named for her security. Despite having already received her student visa, she’s still concerned about entering the US.\\n“I got my visa the day that India attacked Pakistan and Pakistan retaliated against India,” she laughs as she explains how she ventured out that day when both nuclear neighbours were engaged in an aerial face-off, far above in the skies.\\n“Miraculously, the appointment did not get cancelled. And I ended up going there for my interview. And I ended up getting the visa, which was like, insane. I didn’t really know how I got it. But I mean, I’ve gotten it now!” Ali beams, her excitement undeniable at her luck.\\nAlthough she had the option to study in Europe, she chose the US because of her familiarity with the country through movies and TV shows. Even without having visited, she feels like she understands American life and culture.\\n“These values of American democracy are about American freedom. And, you know, just a lot of focus on ethics and morality, and it used to be known for its academic freedom, and a lot of focus on diversity.”\\nAli’s ideals are not without scepticism or worry. She admits being very scared and has reconsidered her decision several times. Still, she feels encouraged by the pushback the Trump administration’s policies have received lately.\\n“The core of American democracy or ideals of freedom are getting reinforced,” says Ali.\\xa0 She feels strongly that the cultural experience will be worth it for her.\\nCrackdown on pro-Palestine students and staff\\nThe Trump administration’s latest step in its crackdown on US universities has particularly focused on international students who have shown support for Palestinians in Gaza over the past year.\\n“Georgetown has a pretty large international student population compared to other schools in the US, so you’d think that would translate into a lot more advocacy and more grassroots work going on on campus,” Mahmoud goes on to say.\\nStudents march during an on-campus protest in support of Palestine at Georgetown University on September 4, 2024, in Washington, DC [Andrew Harnik/Getty Images]\\nMahmoud feels her college hasn’t been a very vocal campus when it comes to the rights of students, nor in providing a proper safety net for freedom of speech.\\n“I think a massive inflection point on campus was the detention of Dr Badar Suri.

Suri, whose wife Mapheze Saleh is a US citizen of Palestinian descent, has spoken out against Israel’s war in Gaza.\\nThat particular case became a real turning point on the campus, she says, where a lot of international students had spoken up and taken to social media.\\nHow much money is at stake?\\nAccording to NAFSA, the 1.1 million international students studying in the US contributed $43.8bn to the US economy during the 2023–2024 academic year, creating 378,175 jobs nationwide.\\nThat means that for every three international students enrolled, one US job was created or supported.\\nCalifornia hosted the highest number of international students, with 140,858 contributing $6.4bn to the state’s economy and supporting 55,114 jobs. New York followed with 135,813 students, generating $6.3bn and creating 51,719 jobs. Texas came third, with 89,546 international students contributing $2.5bn and supporting 22,112 jobs.\\nIn total, 12 states gained more than $1bn each from the economic contributions of international students. According to NAFSA, international student spending in these 12 states combined to generate 57 percent of the total dollar contribution to the US economy.\\n“When your enrolment declines, then you’re going to have some economic challenges and that’s going to force institutions to have to make some very difficult decisions and choices,” NAFSA executive director Fanta Aw explains.\\n“The number of high schoolers that are graduating is on the decline in most parts of the country. So it’s not like they can make that up with American domestic students because that’s already on the decline.”\\n“So when you cannot have the level of enrollment at the undergraduate level here in the US and that is then compounded with the decline in international students, that’s a perfect storm.”\\nAw says many international students who return home contribute to their countries, while those who stay in the US contribute through taxes and help boost the overall economy.\\nWhat do international students study?\\nIn the 2023-2024 academic year, among the 1.1 million students, the most popular majors were Math and Computer Science, Engineering, and Business and Management.\\nInternational students enrolled in English language programs contributed $371.3m and supported 2,691 jobs.\\n(Al Jazeera)\\nIn terms of degrees, nearly half (502,000) of all international students were registered for postgraduate programmes, 343,000 in undergraduate programmes, 243,000 in Optional Practical Training (OPT), and 39,000 in non-degree programmes.\\n*Name has been changed to protect anonymity', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: US risks losing international students, billions\\nENTITIES: US State Department, NAFSA, Trump administration, Georgetown University, China, India\\nEVENT: The US is experiencing a decline in international student enrollment due to restrictive immigration policies and concerns about freedom of speech, impacting university finances and the US economy.\\nCONTEXT: US universities face economic challenges due to declining international student enrollment and domestic high school graduates.', 'createdAt': '2025-06-05T08:04:47.658Z'}, {'id': 103639, 'sourceId': 6, 'url': 'https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2025/6/5/pilgrims-gather-in-saudi-arabia-for-hajj?traffic_source=rss', 'title': 'Pilgrims gather in Saudi Arabia for Hajj', 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T06:30:46.000Z', 'content': 'Hajj, one of the Five Pillars of Islam, is a religious obligation involving rituals and acts of worship that every Muslim must fulfil if they have the financial means and are physically able to do so.\\nMore than 1.5 million foreign pilgrims have arrived in Saudi Arabia for this year’s Hajj, according to a government spokesperson on Wednesday.

Nearly all respondents – 97% – said they supported the immediate recognition of the state of Palestine.The results are based on an online questionnaire circulated by the LMN between 2 April and 16 May. There were 221 respondents out of 477 eligible Labour Muslim MPs, councillors and elected mayors.The findings lay bare the political difficulties the government faces over its response to the war between Israel and Hamas and the continuing humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza.Starmer told the Commons on Wednesday that Gaza was facing “dark days” and he vowed to consider “further action”. Last month the government suspended free trade talks with Israel and hit West Bank settlers with sanctions.Ministers have come under pressure to recognise Palestine as a state jointly with France this month. More than 140 UN countries including Spain, Ireland and Norway recognise the Palestinian state, but the UK doing so would be of major significance given that the region was under British control until 1948.Labour committed in its manifesto to recognising a Palestinian state as part of a peace process resulting in a two-state solution. The government has also been considering imposing sanctions against two hard-right Israeli ministers, Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir.The third lever that ministers have at their disposal is the export of arms to Israel, although according to government figures less than 1% of Israel’s defence imports come from the UK. In the autumn, David Lammy, the foreign secretary, suspended 30 arms export licenses, from a total of 350.Campaigners and charities have launched a judicial review over allegations that the government acted unlawfully in continuing to sell F-35 parts and components to a global pool, when some of those components might be used by Israel in Gaza in a way that the government regards as a breach of international law.Labour MPs on the left of the party called for stronger action in the Commons on Wednesday. Hamish Falconer, the minister for the Middle East, said Israel’s newly introduced measures for aid delivery in Gaza were “inhumane, foster desperation and endanger civilians”.He said: “We are appalled by repeated reports of mass casualty incidents in which Palestinians have been killed when trying to access aid sites in Gaza. Desperate civilians who have endured 20 months of war should never face the risk of death or injury to simply feed themselves and their families. We call for an immediate and independent investigation into these events for the perpetrators to be held to account.”In March, Lammy told the Commons he believed Israel had broken international law by blocking aid to Gaza, but a day later he was contradicted by Downing Street.The war in Gaza cost Labour votes in areas with large Muslim communities in the election last summer, particularly after an LBC interview in which Starmer appeared to say Israel had the right to withhold water and electricity in Gaza.Pro-Gaza independents defeated Labour candidates in Dewsbury and Batley, Blackburn, Birmingham Perry Barr and Leicester South and came close in several other constituencies, including Wes Streeting’s Ilford North.The LMN survey found that 58% of Labour Muslim representatives thought the government had represented British Muslims badly so far.The results also recorded dissatisfaction with the Labour party, with 66% of those surveyed saying they did not believe Muslim representatives were treated equally compared with others in the party. A third of Muslim Labour representatives said they had directly experienced Islamophobia and more than half said they did not believe the party took Islamophobia seriously.A spokesperson for the LMN said its report was a “call to action” for “a renewed commitment to Muslim representation, rooted in equality and justice”. “Our Labour party cannot credibly claim to be an anti-racist movement while ignoring the testimonies and experiences of its own Muslim elected officials,” they said.A Labour party spokesperson said: “The Labour party is proud of the diversity of our party, including the increase in the number of Muslim MPs in the parliamentary Labour party and having the first Muslim lord chancellor in Shabana Mahmood, and the first Muslim mayor of London in Sadiq Khan.“We are the party of equality and we take any complaints of discrimination, including Islamophobia, seriously.

It is absurd and misleading to call any part of the ocean that allows these activities protected.”Campaigners have been calling for years for a ban, but public outcry has intensified since a film by Sir David Attenborough was released last month, to coincide with his 99th birthday.The film, Ocean – which was released in cinemas and will be available on streaming services in June – showed in detail some of the vital habitats raked by the massive nets that in effect plough up the seabed, leaving deep scars where it can take many years for marine life to recover.Toby Perkins, the chair of the Commons committee, said: “Ministers must ensure that marine protected areas live up to their name. [They] have all the information they need to press ahead with banning bottom trawling in the offshore protected areas where it presents the most risk. Why the delay? Our oceans cannot afford any more prevarication. It is time to act.”The UK will send representatives to a UN oceans conference later this month. Ministers have previously indicated they could take action, and there are protections in place against damaging fishing practices in about 60% of the current marine protected areas but no full ban has yet been brought in.A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “Our precious marine animals and habitats have been under threat for too long.

Art Fund has provided £750,000 but another £2.9m needs to be found before the deadline of 27 August.Eleanor Clayton, senior curator at the Hepworth Wakefield and a Barbara Hepworth specialist, said the sculpture by the Wakefield-born artist must be kept in the UK so future generations could see it on display.Barbara Hepworth circa 1950. Photograph: Fox Photos/GettyShe said: “Hepworth is obviously one of the most important British sculptors and really set the standard for what we think of as modern sculpture today. The piece is one of the earliest and best examples of the wooden, string-carved sculptures that she became really well known for.”Clayton added: “It’s an incredible opportunity. If we’re successful, it would be pretty much on permanent display to the public, either in Wakefield or we would lend it to important exhibitions around the country.”Sculpture with Colour (Oval Form) Pale Blue and Red was made in 1943 after Hepworth had moved her family to St Ives in Cornwall with her then husband, Ben Nicholson, to escape the blitz during the second world war.Hepworth had to obtain a special permit to use wood for her sculptures and the piece was crafted using string, one of the first times she had worked in such a way.“They required a government permanent permit to carve into wood,” said Clayton. “She wrote a lot about the difficulties of actually obtaining seasoned wood that wouldn’t split immediately when she started carving. There’s only a handful of these that are still in existence.”Hepworth once said the strings represented the tension she felt between “myself and the sea, the wind or the hills” in Cornwall. She worked in St Ives up to her death in a fire in 1975.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionSculpture with Colour (Oval Form) Pale Blue and Red was initially bought by the “patron, socialite and connoisseur” Helen Sutherland and has always remained in private ownership. The work was cherished by Hepworth and the plaster prototype of the sculpture was the only piece she brought with her to Cornwall.Clayton said that the making of the piece was remarkable, not just because of the difficulties related to the war but also the time constraints Hepworth faced due to her domestic workload.“She was juggling childcare and domestic chores,” Clayton said. “She wrote in a letter to a friend and critic how she had to work for 30 minutes, and then she had to cook for the children, and then she’d go back to the studio and carve for another 20 minutes. Then she’d have to go and do some washing. It’s sort of astonishing that it was made within these circumstances and with the threat of war in the background.”The piece was last shown in the UK as part of the Hepworth retrospective at Tate Britain in 2015 – one of the rare times it’s been seen in public.That exhibition was the first big UK staging of her work since the late 1960s. For much of her lifetime Hepworth lived in the shadow of Henry Moore – the other great British 20th-century sculptor.”Clayton said Hepworth had expressly wanted her work to be seen in the flesh. “She said you have to see the sculpture in three dimensions – you have to walk around it.

Yellow stripes on the wheat leaves are typical of an infestation. Credit: Katharina Jung, University of Zurich\\nWheat production is threatened by a major fungal disease: yellow rust. Researchers at the University of Zurich have found traditional wheat varieties from Asia that harbor several resistance-conferring genes. They may serve as a durable source of yellow rust resistance in commercial varieties in the future, highlighting the importance of genetic diversity for food security.\\nYellow rust, also known as stripe rust, is caused by a fungal pathogen named Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici. The plant disease affects around 88% of global bread wheat production and is one of the most devastating threats to wheat yields. New strategies against the fungus are therefore urgently needed.\\nAn international team headed by researchers at the University of Zurich (UZH) has now discovered two genomic regions in traditional wheat varieties from Asia which confer resistance to the disease.\\n\"If such genes can be transferred to commercial wheat varieties, they could be important in combating yellow rust,\" says Kentaro Shimizu, professor at the UZH Department of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies, who is responsible for a new study on the subject.\\nThe study has been published in Theoretical and Applied Genetics.\\nGenetic diversity of local wheat varieties\\nFor decades, targeted breeding of wheat focused on developing high-yielding varieties. While these modern varieties helped feed the world, their limited genetic diversity led to increased vulnerability to threats such as pests, diseases and extreme climates.\\nIn contrast to modern varieties, traditional wheat varieties have been maintained by local farmers in different regions of the world and are therefore less impacted by the loss of genetic diversity. Traditional varieties from Asia appeared particularly promising, for they have been underexplored despite being a potential reservoir of genetic diversity with higher disease resistance.\\nDuring her Ph.D. in Shimizu\\'s team, Katharina Jung conducted research on wheat yellow rust resistance in collaboration with the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) in Mexico and the Kyoto University in Japan. Jung screened both traditional and modern varieties from Japan, China, Nepal and Pakistan.\\nFirst, she identified yellow rust-resistant wheat plants in large-scale field experiments in Reckenholz, Switzerland, and at CIMMYT, Mexico. Then, she located genomic regions that contribute to yellow rust resistance, so-called quantitative trait loci.\\nIf it were possible to utilize the resistance genes from local Asian varieties in breeding modern wheat varieties, crop losses could be reduced in the future.

Taken together with our findings, we hypothesize that traditional varieties from this area might harbor unique and stable resistances to yellow rust,\" says Jung.\\nA more targeted search for novel yellow rust resistances from this area could potentially provide long-lasting protection against a wide range of pathogen strains.\\nSeveral wheat varieties with differently shaped ears.

Ask most business analysts, and you'll hear about innovation, financial acumen, or strategic pivots. But new research suggests another key to organizational survival: environmental sustainability.\\nIn a study recently published in Frontiers in Organizational Psychology, an international team of researchers reveals a robust link between organizations' longevity and their commitment to environmentally sustainable business practices.\\nThe findings challenge the assumption that younger, more agile companies are best positioned to lead on climate and environmental issues.\\nThe study explores whether firms that have stood the test of time—some over a century old—are also those most committed to preserving the planet. It's a timely question. As climate change accelerates and the call for corporate accountability grows louder, understanding the organizational characteristics associated with environmental responsibility is more critical than ever.\\nThe study analyzed data from hundreds of firms, including industry leaders in tech, manufacturing, and finance, in the United States, Europe, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), and Asia. The goal was simple yet ambitious: determine whether older organizations exhibit stronger environmental sustainability performance than younger ones.\\nTo answer this, the team analyzed environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings drawn from multiple independent sources, including CSRHub, S&P Global, and Thomson Reuters, that evaluate companies on the dimensions of climate strategy, eco-efficiency, and environmental reporting.\\nStanding the test of time\\nThe results were striking. In every region examined, older organizations outperformed their younger counterparts on environmental metrics.\\nThese effects held even when accounting for company size and wealth, suggesting that longevity itself—not just financial clout—correlates with environmental stewardship.\\nIn the United States, for example, companies established more than a century ago showed markedly higher sustainability scores than those formed in the last two decades. The same pattern emerged in MENA and Asian markets.\\nThe effect was slightly less pronounced in Europe, likely due to limited availability of incorporation dates of companies in that region, rather than reflecting a substantive difference in sustainability performance.\\nBeyond establishing this link, the team say their paper takes a deeper dive into why older organizations might be greener, building on evolutionary theories of organizations, resource dependence theory, and psychological frameworks like Cybernetic Trait Complexes Theory.\\nThe central thesis: surviving over time requires adaptation—not just to markets, but to environmental and societal demands. Organizations that endure are those that have learned to navigate resource scarcity, respond to public scrutiny, and build sustainable systems into their operations. In this light, sustainability is not an add-on; it is a survival strategy.\\nThe implications of this work extend beyond theory. One key takeaway is that sustainability is not just the domain of startups or mission-driven newcomers. Older firms, often seen as sluggish or resistant to change, may in fact be the most effective stewards of sustainability, thanks to decades of institutional knowledge, established systems, and embedded norms.\\nThese organizations are not only capable of setting long-term goals; they often have the operational discipline and stakeholder networks to see those goals through.\\nGreen shoots of growth\\nThese findings also carry weight for policy and practice. Policymakers might consider designing incentives that recognize the sustainability strengths of mature organizations, while also supporting younger companies in building long-term environmental strategies. For investors, the message is equally compelling. ESG scores are increasingly used to evaluate corporate risk and resilience.\\nIf sustainability performance is a signal of adaptability and thus of long-term viability, then green credentials may offer a glimpse into a company's staying power.\\nStill, one must be careful not to paint a one-sided picture. Of course, some legacy firms emerged from eras of industrial pollution and ecological harm. Nonetheless, what matters is not where these companies started but how they have evolved. Data show that many older firms have adapted meaningfully, outperforming younger peers even in innovation-related sustainability metrics.\\nPerhaps most powerfully, the team believes these data call for a new narrative about sustainability in business. Sustainability is not a generational rivalry. It is not a race between new and old, small and large, or East and West; it is a test of adaptation, a shared evolutionary journey where the most enduring organizations are often those that embrace sustainability as central to who they are.\\nThe climate crisis is rewriting what it means to lead in business, and in this new chapter, the champions will be not only the boldest or the strongest, but the greenest.\\nMore information:\\nSurvival of the Greenest: Environmental Sustainability and Longevity of Organizations, Frontiers in Organizational Psychology (2025).

It means there is a reservoir of the HIV in the body, capable of reactivation, that neither the immune system nor drugs can tackle.Now researchers from the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne, have demonstrated a way to make the virus visible, paving the way to fully clear it from the body.It is based on mRNA technology, which came to prominence during the Covid-19 pandemic when it was used in vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech.In a paper published in Nature Communications, the researchers have shown for the first time that mRNA can be delivered into the cells where HIV is hiding, by encasing it in a tiny, specially formulated fat bubble. The mRNA then instructs the cells to reveal the virus.Globally, there are almost 40 million people living with HIV, who must take medication for the rest of their lives in order to suppress the virus and ensure they do not develop symptoms or transmit it. For many it remains deadly, with UNAids figures suggesting one person died of HIV every minute in 2023.It was “previously thought impossible” to deliver mRNA to the type of white blood cell that is home to HIV, said Dr Paula Cevaal, research fellow at the Doherty Institute and co-first author of the study, because those cells did not take up the fat bubbles, or lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), used to carry it.The team have developed a new type of LNP that those cells will accept, known as LNP X. She said: “Our hope is that this new nanoparticle design could be a new pathway to an HIV cure.”When a colleague first presented test results at the lab’s weekly meeting, Cevaal said, they seemed too good to be true.“We sent her back into the lab to repeat it, and she came back the next week with results that were equally good. So we had to believe it. And of course, since then, we’ve repeated it many, many, many more times.“We were overwhelmed by how [much of a] night and day difference it was – from not working before, and then all of a sudden it was working. And all of us were just sitting gasping like, ‘wow’.”Further research will be needed to determine whether revealing the virus is enough to allow the body’s immune system to deal with it, or whether the technology will need to be combined with other therapies to eliminate HIV from the body.The study is laboratory based and was carried out in cells donated by HIV patients. The path to using the technology as part of a cure for patients is long, and would require successful tests in animals followed by safety trials in humans, likely to take years, before efficacy trials could even begin.“In the field of biomedicine, many things eventually don’t make it into the clinic – that is the unfortunate truth; I don’t want to paint a prettier picture than what is the reality,” stressed Cevaal. “But in terms of specifically the field of HIV cure, we have never seen anything close to as good as what we are seeing, in terms of how well we are able to reveal this virus.“So from that point of view, we’re very hopeful that we are also able to see this type of response in an animal, and that we could eventually do this in humans.”Dr Michael Roche of the University of Melbourne and co-senior author of the research, said the discovery could have broader implications beyond HIV, with the relevant white blood cells also involved in other diseases including cancers.Dr Jonathan Stoye, a retrovirologist and emeritus scientist at the Francis Crick Institute, who was not involved in the study, said the approach taken by the Melbourne team appeared be a major advance on existing strategies to force the virus out of hiding, but further studies would be needed to determine how best to kill it after that.He added: “Ultimately, one big unknown remains. Do you need to eliminate the entire reservoir for success or just the major part? If just 10% of the latent reservoir survives will that be sufficient to seed new infection? Only time will tell.“However, that does not detract from the significance of the current study, which represents a major potential advance in delivery of mRNA for therapeutic purposes to blood cells.”Prof Tomáš Hanke of the Jenner Institute, University of Oxford, disputed the idea that getting RNA into white blood cells had been a significant challenge. He said the hope that all cells in the body where HIV was hiding could be reached in this way was “merely a dream”.', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: New mRNA tech reveals hidden HIV virus\\nENTITIES: Peter Doherty Institute, Paula Cevaal, Michael Roche, Jonathan Stoye, Tomáš Hanke, University of Melbourne, Francis Crick Institute, Jenner Institute, University of Oxford\\nEVENT: Researchers developed LNP X, a new lipid nanoparticle, to deliver mRNA into white blood cells hiding HIV, forcing the virus to become visible.

Earlier in the day, Pochin had asked Prime Minister Keir Starmer during PMQs, whether he believed that the burqa should be banned.She said: “Given the prime minister\\'s desire to strengthen strategic alignment with our European neighbours, will he, in the interests of public safety, follow the lead of France, Denmark, Belgium and others and ban the burqa?\" Starmer refused to answer the question, instead focusing on Reform’s policies and pointing to the fact that Pochin had been a Conservative MP during Liz Truss’s mini-budget. Reform UK later distanced itself from the question, insisting that a burqa ban was not “party policy\".A political commentator labelled Pochin as \"racist\" on GB News (Image: GB News) Get the latest politics news straight to your phone Join us on WhatsAppOur community members are treated to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners.

It\\'s against other women too.\" Several countries across Europe have banned the wearing of face-coverings in public to various degrees, a point made by Daubney to counter the idea that Pochin’s suggestion was plucked from the far-right.

ArchiveHis son Dr Jack Mosley, a GP registrar, who researched GLP-1 drug brands including Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound with his father, has also written a book titled Food Noise: How Weight Loss Medication And Smart Nutrition Can Silence Your Cravings.In December, a coroner said Mosley’s death was “indeterminate” and “unascertainable”, adding that it “was most likely attributable either to heatstroke (accidental) or non-identified pathological cause”.Mosley had presented BBC Radio 4’s Just One Thing, and the BBC series Trust Me, I’m A Doctor, which looked at healthcare in Britain.He would regularly push his body during various programmes, and in a 2014 documentary he ingested tapeworms for six weeks.In a 2015 programme he made two black puddings out of his own blood to showcase its nutritional value.The BBC honoured the doctor-turned-science broadcaster with a day dedicated to him in July 2024, when presenters and audiences where encouraged to do “just one thing” to improve their wellbeing.His wife Clare accepted the Hall of Fame Award at the British Podcast Awards on his behalf in September 2024.', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance':

pair also planned to blow up a restaurant and wine shop owned by the man, who has been a vocal critic of Vladimir Putin.The pair were livestreamed as they set fire to a business supplying StarLink satellite equipment to Ukraine after being recruited by agents for the terrorist Wagner Group, the court heard.Around £1 million of damage was caused by the blaze at an industrial unit in Leyton, east London, last March 20, the court was told.The attack was orchestrated by Dylan Earl, 20, and Jake Reeves, 23, who have admitted aggravated arson on behalf of the Wagner Group and an offence under the National Security Act, jurors heard.Jakeem Rose, 23, Ugnius Asmena, 20, Nii Mensah, 23 and Paul English, 61, were allegedly recruited to set fire to the warehouse.Opening their trial on Wednesday, Duncan Penny KC said the evidence against them was \"overwhelming\".He said that CCTV, traffic cameras and phone evidence tracked their journey in English\\'s Kia Picanto through south London to the scene of the fire.More footage captured Rose and Mensah getting out of the vehicle, climbing over a wall and approaching the warehouses, jurors heard.Having filled a jerry can en route at a petrol station, Rose poured the contents onto warehouse unit doors and set them alight, it was alleged.Meanwhile, Mensah filmed the arson attack on his mobile phone and livestreamed it on FaceTime, jurors were told.From left: Nii Mensah, Dmirjus Paulauskas, Paul English, Ashton Evans, Jakeem Rose and Ugnius Asmena appearing at the Old BaileyPA/PA WireJurors were told that a lorry driver parked nearby was bedding down for the night at the time.He bravely but unsuccessfully tried to put out the fire, putting himself in significant danger, Mr Penny said.Rose dropped a very large knife with his DNA on it, with Mensah later messaging Reeves to say \"L9 (Rose\\'s nickname) left his Rambo at the scene\", the court heard.Eight fire crews tackled the \"significant\" fire on the Cromwell Industrial Estate after it broke out shortly before midnight.It caused \"extensive damage\" to the property and risked the lives of those nearby, he said.About 20 minutes after the attack, Mensah allegedly messaged Earl: \"Bro there was bare smoke ... You saw it on Face Time.\"A few hours later, he allegedly added: \"Bro lol it\\'s on the news ... we dun damagees (sic).\"Mr Penny told jurors: \"This was deliberate and calculated criminality - at the behest of foreign influence.\"In the case of these defendants at the time of the fire they may have been ignorant of that influence and the motive may have been financial - good old-fashioned greed.\"For others, however, it appears to have been both political and ideological.\"The prosecutor said the warehouse was targeted for its connection to Ukraine and the fact that the business there was concerned in logistics.The firm frequently delivered goods to Ukraine, including StarLink satellite equipment, and was involved in organising humanitarian aid, the court was told.Earl was said to be the \"architect\" of the warehouse attack.He had come into contact with the Wagner Group via a channel on Telegram, the court was told.Mr Penny said: \"It appears that Dylan Earl expressed a willingness to undertake \\'missions\\' of which the Leyton arson attack was the first.\"It is apparent that Dylan Earl knew he was acting against Ukrainian, and for Russian, interests.\"Once Reeves discovered the motivation behind it, he was prepared to agree to accept money from a foreign intelligence service to target an individual and businesses in the capital, the jury was told.Earl, of Elmesthorpe, Leicestershire, and Reeves, of Croydon, have admitted plots to set fire to the Hide Restaurant and Hedonism Wines in Mayfair, west London, and kidnapping their owner on behalf of the Wagner Group, the court heard.The court was told the two Mayfair businesses targeted by the Wagner Group collectively employed 200 people and were valued at more than £30 million.The owner was described as a \"high-profile Russian dissident and refugee\" who has been vocal in his criticism of President Vladimir Putin and the war in Ukraine. He had even driven aid trucks from the UK to Ukraine personally.Earl explained to Reeves the Wagner Group had been interested in burning down warehouses as they sent \"100+\" lorries to Ukraine.In apparent reference to the explosion and kidnap plots, they discussed \"5K\" for \"boom\" and \"50k\" for \"napping\", jurors were told.Earl said the payment was coming from Russia and the target should be brought to him so he could be \"exiled to Russia to face prison\", the court was told.On 5 April 2024, Reeves sent an unknown contact the full name of the Russian dissident commenting that he would be an \"amazing target\" for them, the court was told.Mr Penny said: \"You might think that it is self-evident that these actions were designed to influence the government and to intimidate at least a section of the public and furthermore were made for the purpose of advancing a political and ideological cause.\"It is also relevant that at least one method of attack on the Mayfair premises discussed between Earl and Evans was by way of explosion.\"Rose, of Croydon, Asmena, of no fixed address, Mensah, of Thornton Heath and English, of Roehampton, have denied aggravated arson.Two other defendants, Ashton Evans, 20, from Newport, Gwent, and Dmirjus Paulauskas, 23, from Croydon, are each charged with two counts of failing to disclose information about terrorist acts, which they deny.The Old Bailey trial continues.', 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Wagner spies plotted kidnapping, arson in London\\nENTITIES: Wagner Group, Vladimir Putin, Dylan Earl, Jake Reeves, Ukraine, Russia\\nEVENT: Wagner spies plotted to kidnap a Russian dissident, blow up his restaurant, and set fire to a warehouse supplying Ukraine with Starlink equipment.

He said the list could be revised and new countries could be added.The proclamation is effective on June 9, 2025, at 12.01am EDT (4.01am GMT). Visas issued before that date will not be revoked, the order said.During his first term in office, Trump announced a ban on travellers from seven Muslim-majority nations, a policy that went through several iterations before it was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018.Former President Joe Biden, a Democrat who succeeded Trump, repealed that ban on nationals from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen in 2021, calling it “a stain on our national conscience.”Trump said the countries subject to the most severe restrictions were determined to harbour a “large-scale presence of terrorists,” fail to cooperate on visa security and have an inability to verify travelers’ identities, inadequate record-keeping of criminal histories and high rates of visa overstays in the United States.Trump claimed there were “millions and millions of these illegals who should not be in our country”.“We will not let what happened in Europe happen to America,” he said, adding, “very simply, we cannot have open migration from any country where we cannot safely and reliably vet and screen those who seek to enter the United States”.“We will not allow people to enter our country who wish to do us harm.”An Egyptian national, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, has been charged in the attack. Federal officials said Soliman had overstayed his tourist visa and had an expired work permit - although Egypt is not on the list of countries facing travel limits.Somalia immediately pledged to work with the US to address security issues.“Somalia values its longstanding relationship with the United States and stands ready to engage in dialogue to address the concerns raised,” Dahir Hassan Abdi, the Somali ambassador to the United States, said in a statement.Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, a close ally of President Nicolas Maduro, responded on Wednesday evening by describing the US government as fascist and warning Venezuelans of being in the US“The truth is being in the United States is a big risk for anybody, not just for Venezuelans ... They persecute our countrymen, our people for no reason.”A spokesperson for the Taliban-led Afghan foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Pakistan’s foreign ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment on how it would handle the thousands of Afghans waiting in Islamabad who had been in the pipeline for US resettlement.Calls early on Thursday to the spokesperson of Myanmar’s military government were not answered. The foreign ministry of Laos did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump campaigned on a tough border strategy and previewed his plan in an October 2023 speech, pledging to restrict people from the Gaza Strip, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen and “anywhere else that threatens our security”.Trump issued an executive order on January 20 requiring intensified security vetting of any foreigners seeking admission to the US to detect national security threats. That order directed several cabinet members to submit a list of countries from which travel should be partly or fully suspended because their “vetting and screening information is so deficient.”The latest travel restrictions were first reported by CBS News.In March, Reuters reported that the Trump administration was considering travel restrictions on dozens of countries.', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Trump bans travel from 12 countries\\nENTITIES: Donald Trump, Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, Venezuela, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, Egypt, Somalia, Dahir Hassan Abdi, Nicolas Maduro, Diosdado Cabello, Pakistan\\nEVENT: Donald Trump signed a proclamation banning nationals from 12 countries from entering the US, citing security concerns and potential terrorist threats; the ban is set to take effect on June 9, 2025, with some countries facing partial restrictions.\\nCONTEXT: This is part of Trump's broader immigration crackdown during his second term, sparking international reactions and concerns.\", 'createdAt': '2025-06-05T08:04:47.658Z'}, {'id': 104727, 'sourceId': 12314, 'url': 'https://www.foxnews.com/us/karen-read-defense-gets-boost-plow-driver-testifies-he-saw-no-body-snow-during-boston-cop-death-case', 'title': 'Karen Read defense gets boost as plow driver testifies he saw no body in snow during Boston cop death case', 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T04:00:27.000Z', 'content': 'Join Fox News for access to this content Plus special access to select articles and other premium content with your account - free of charge.

Of these, six to 10 are forecast to become hurricanes with winds of 74 miles per hour (mph) or higher, including three to five major hurricanes with winds of 111mph or higher.\\nHurricane Beryl, a Category 4 storm, pummelled Jamaica in early July last year, causing extensive damage to properties and infrastructure, especially in the southwestern section of the island.\\nIt damaged crops, lifted roofs, and left hundreds of citizens without power for weeks.\\nSpeaking at a National Disaster Risk Management Council (NDRMC) meeting yesterday, Holness highlighted the impact of Hurricane Beryl and stated that it is imperative that the country further strengthen its institutions to mitigate the effect of any future storms.\\n“Our approach includes strengthening national institutions and legislations; investing in science, technology and early warning systems; building capacity at community level; aligning the national framework with climate resilience; and ensuring that disaster risk reduction is cross-cutting – touching education, housing, health, infrastructure, energy and the environment,” he said.\\nRESILIENT UTILITIES\\nHe emphasised the importance of improving the resilience of the country’s utilities, and noted that the Jamaica Public Service Company had already started a comprehensive review of its distribution network to replace broken or damaged poles.\\nHe stated that this work should be ongoing throughout the year and be done “with great speed and alacrity”.\\nThe Government has also commenced work to provide an independent source of energy for key National Water Commission pumping stations, in the event of power outage during a hurricane, Holness disclosed.\\nHe noted that the long-term plan is to ensure that those pumping stations that are critical areas for supply and distribution have backup generators or are powered by solar energy.\\nThe damage caused to roofs underscored the need for hurricane straps, Holness contended. To this end, he said the municipalities have some work to do.\\n“The parish councils (municipal corporations), the approval entities and the Ministry of Local Government, through a national public campaign, must reinforce the building codes as it relates to roofs, and the need to build according to code, and use in particular hurricane straps to secure roofs,” he said.\\nMinister of Local Government Desmond McKenzie declared that the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM) would continue the distribution of hurricane straps this year.\\n“The ODPEM initiated, last year, a hurricane strap programme, and we are expecting this year to do the same by providing, through the municipal corporations, a couple thousand hurricane straps,” he said.\\nMcKenzie added: “As we prepare for this hurricane season, more than 900 shelters are being inspected and are ready.”\\nHolness also stated that the Government has been investing in the expansion of early warning systems, and collaborating with other regional entities. He shared that, with the help of the Japanese government, Jamaica now has a robust national disaster emergency telecommunication system and public safety network.\\n“These allow us to disseminate real-time alerts, mobilise response teams, and reach even our most remote communities in times of crisis,” he said.\\nAnd although he lauded the recovery of farmers from the impact of Hurricane Beryl, Holness, who chairs the NDRMC, acknowledged that the Government must strengthen its support, especially for those who utilise greenhouses.\\nHe also stressed the need for greater investment in coastal protection, as the threat of sea level rising intensifies.\\nCENTRALISED DATABASE\\nHe added that there was a need for a centralised database of citizens affected by the disaster, to prevent the duplication of aid distribution.\\nHolness outlined proactive steps taken by the Government to fortify Jamaica’s ability to respond to and recover from disasters. These include establishing a disaster recovery fund and a contingency fund.\\nThe Government is also participating in, and has embarked on, other initiatives, such as the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility and the Catastrophe Bond.\\nMinister of Finance and the Public Service Fayval Williams noted that this National Natural Disaster Risk Financing Policy, which ensures financial flexibility to meet natural disasters, now stands at approximately $130.6 billion. The amount the Government can access will depend on the severity of the disaster, she said.\\n“An advantage of the catastrophe coverage we have in place is that it is parametric, meaning there are predefined thresholds, and predefined payouts,” she said.\\nThe prime minister, in the meantime, urged citizens to safeguard their identification documents, so that in the event of a hurricane, they would be able to access aid.\\n“Preparedness is not just being able to conduct humanitarian exercises when a disaster hits. You have to now be prepared to deal with the energy crisis that could come, the trade crisis that could come, the impact on the economy in terms of inflation when goods get scarce, the citizen safety and security issues that could happen; all elements of any consideration as to the stability of the society.”\\nsashana.small@gleanerjm.com', 'location': 'JAM', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Jamaica Enhances Hurricane Preparedness After Beryl\\nENTITIES: Andrew Holness, Hurricane Beryl, Jamaica Public Service Company, National Water Commission, Desmond McKenzie, Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, Fayval Williams\\nEVENT: Jamaica is improving its storm response plans, infrastructure resilience, and early warning systems following damage from Hurricane Beryl, including independent energy sources for water pumping stations and distribution of hurricane straps.\\nCONTEXT: Jamaica strengthens disaster preparedness after Hurricane Beryl.', 'createdAt': '2025-06-05T08:04:47.658Z'}, {'id': 105140, 'sourceId': 12850, 'url': 'https://naturaldisasters.einnews.com/article/819256337/3vcoCAwEtauKatVh?ref=rss&ecode=5DCHg6ojdayQpKlr', 'title': 'Cambodia and Japan Strengthen Collaboration on Flood Risk Management at Sangke Dam', 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T07:50:03.000Z', 'content': '5 June 2025 Local News 158 ViewsIn a significant move to enhance flood risk management, Cambodia and Japan have pledged to work together on the operations and management of dams and watersheds along the Sangke River.

Pure abuse of power and provoking behaviour! Bullying 10 year olds!'You wouldn't see them doing this to anyone other community!

The fair, which attracts crowds of up to 10,000, will feature horse riding, horse trading, traditional music, dance performances and shopping stalls People ride their horses and traps through Appleby ahead of the annual Appleby Horse Fair Locals said they have never seen so many Gypsy, Roma and Traveller (GRT) people descend on the town so early In one video he says: 'We are gypsy people stopping at Fell End and hurting no one. Other vehicles are parked on common land and they are not going to check them out, they are just checking gypsy vehicles. Is this racism?'Locals said they have never seen so many Gypsy, Roma and Traveller (GRT) people descend on the town so early.For years the town was the focus of the pre-fair gathering but in the recent past locals have fought back, closing down services and pubs and shutting off the places where travellers would usually set up camp.\\xa0One Kirkby Lonsdale local told MailOnline: 'They seem to have descended on us this year and have come earlier and in bigger numbers than we have seen before.'There have been problems caused by gypsy children in the town centre and closer to the camp they have set up in a layby.'One of the biggest concerns for locals - apart from the disruption, criminal damage, littering and occasional assault - is the welfare of the thousands of horses driven to Appleby to be traded in the streets.\\xa0Last year two horses died at Appleby, one a three-year-old stallion and the other a Shetland pony, both deaths due to exhaustion and overworking. The RSPCA intervened in 438 cases in total.\\xa0Local campaigners say stricter regulations need to be placed on the event with spot checks on animal passports.The Appleby Fair Communities Group said: 'There are no checks on horse passports, we know horses are traded but the authorities never spot check passports. We know horses are moved, but with no check on passports ever.

That's pretty tragic really.' Travellers are also accused of digging up or sawing down stakes hammered into roadside verges with the aim of keeping horses and caravans from parking up.\\xa0Pictures show a road into Appleby with traveller vehicles parked all the way along a grassy verge.\\xa0Locals claim the posts hammered in by the local authority with signs nailed on making it clear parking was banned, have been uprooted.\\xa0 A traditional horse drawn caravan makes its way to the annuall fair Cumbria Police has warned motorists to expect slow-moving traffic in the next two weeks because of the Appleby Fair A local business park in Kirkby Lonsdale tried in vain to stop gypsies useing their car parks by blocking entrances with containers Cumbria Police has warned motorists to expect slow-moving traffic in the next two weeks because of the Appleby Fair.\\xa0Detective Superintendent Dan St Quintin of Cumbria Police – Police Gold Commander for Appleby Horse Fair – said: 'Public safety is our number one priority for Appleby Horse Fair which is why we are encouraging all road users to be cautious and vigilant on the roads.'Drivers need to be aware that the likelihood that they encounter slow-moving traffic is high so please pay extra attention when travelling around the county.'I ask people to pay particular attention when driving on the A66, where there is the potential for fast-moving traffic to encounter slow-moving, potentially horse-drawn, vehicles.'Please take extra care, be patient and plan ahead and set off early.\\xa0'Let's make sure everyone reaches their destination safely.'The fair is held outside the town of Appleby, at the point where the old Roman Road crosses Long Marton Road, on Gallows Hill, which was named after the public hangings that were once carried out there.It was once thought the fair originated from a royal charter to the borough of Appleby from King James II of England in 1685, although more recent research has found the charter was cancelled before it was ever enacted. Caravans have also taken over a farmers field en route to Appleby 'There have been problems caused by gypsy children in the town centre and closer to the camp they have set up in a layby,' a local said The gathering is sometimes known as 'the New Fair' because Appleby's medieval borough fair, held at Whitsuntide, ceased in 1885.The 'New Fair' began in 1775 for sheep and cattle drovers and horse dealers to sell their stock.By the 1900s it had evolved into a major Gypsy/Traveller event which brought families from across the UK and Europe.In its 250 year history the fair has only been cancelled twice, the first in 2001 during the foot and mouth outbreak and the second in 2020 due to the COVID pandemic.\", 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Appleby Horse Fair: Travellers Arrive, Tensions Rise\\nENTITIES: Appleby, Travellers, Gypsies, Cumbria Police, Kirkby Lonsdale\\nEVENT: Thousands of travellers descend on Appleby for the annual horse fair, leading to increased police presence and local anxiety due to reported crime and disruption.

Please email tom.cotterill@mailonline.co.uk\\nHorrified villagers in a sleepy rural hamlet have accused a 'land-grabbing' group of travellers of 'devastating' their home by tearing up a field and paving it in 24 hours.\\xa0'Powerless' locals in the isolated farming community of Charles have lashed out at the alleged 'eco-vandalism' after industrial diggers ripped into a field and levelled it.Diggers bulldozed through a large grass bank to gain access to the secluded field in the picturesque north Devon hamlet - which is home to just a few dozen homes.The work, which is believed to be part of an unauthorised project to build a new traveller site, started at about 5pm on Monday evening, locals said.\\xa0Within 24 hours, the tranquil patch of grassland had been transformed into a grey eyesore, standing out against the rolling green hills of the surrounding countryside.\\xa0Devastating aerial pictures can today reveal how the former pony field in the rural oasis has been ruined and turned into a gravel car park, with caravans pitched around it and fence posts installed.\\xa0The works have been carried out without planning permission - and is feared to be part of a new trend of brazen landgrabs carried out by travellers.'This is an atrocity... it's devastated the countryside with absolutely no thought for the harm it will cause,' one furious 47-year-old woman, who lives locally, told MailOnline. A field in a rural patch of north Devon countryside has been ripped apart by bulldozers and turned into a suspected traveller camp (pictured on Wednesday) Pictured is an image showing what the field looked like before it was developed Diggers started working on the isolated plot, north of the village of Charles, without permission on Monday evening, sparking outrage from locals. Within 48 hours, it had been ruined A JCB is pictured on the field on Tuesday afternoon, with caravans parked at the end of the site 'A massive JCB has ripped out the bank, which is protected because of nesting birds.\\xa0They have flattened the field and it looks like they're concreting there already.'We feel absolutely powerless right now... It's one rule for one part of society and another rule for the other.'When MailOnline visited the countryside location on Wednesday afternoon, a number of men could be seen working at it, using an industrial excavator to carve away ground and roller to flatten it.\\xa0The incident appears to be the latest in a trend sweeping the country which has seen fields unlawfully developed into traveller sites.\\xa0Groups across the UK have been accused of carrying out brazen bank holiday 'land seizures' to rapidly build camps under the noses of council chiefs while their offices are closed.Allegedly weaponising the national breaks, industrial diggers, excavators and lorries carrying gravel, are mobilised to rip up and pave over fields in protected green belts during 'deliberate and meticulously planned' operations.Cynically, the 'illegal' conversions are done without any planning permission, flouting development rules - with 'retrospective' applications later submitted to councils to allow the newly-constructed sites to remain.Since April, locations across the country have seen a sudden surge of developments - with the bulk taking place on the Easter, VE Day and late May bank holidays. The unauthorised development is in the heart of Devon's picturesque rolling countryside When MailOnline visited the location on Wednesday afternoon, a number of men could be seen working at it, using an industrial excavator to carve away ground and roller to flatten it An investigation by MailOnline has revealed similar unauthorised 'landgrabs' blighting villages and towns across Buckinghamshire, West Sussex, Nottinghamshire, Bedfordshire, Gloucester, Worcestershire and Cheshire.It comes after this paper revealed how the quaint village of Burtonwood, near Warrington, in Cheshire, had been the latest to be hit.It was targeted during last week's May bank holiday, with travellers taking less than 72 hours to convert the six-acre field into a gravel car park.\\xa0They covered half the open space in hardcore and also built a 10ft-high wooden fence around the boundary, with groups allegedly working through the night - much to the fury of dismayed locals.\\xa0'I have never felt so impotent as a councillor in not being able to do something,' local politician Stuart Mann said. 'The neighbours suffered for 36 hours solid that went through the night.

Treasurer Jim Chalmers has strongly hinted that Labor won't compromise with the Opposition to increase taxes on super balances above $3million 'We do not have a majority in the Senate; we obviously work with different parties,' the Prime Minister said.While Labor has a landslide majority in the House of Representatives, it needs the support of 10 other senators to get any legislation passed through the upper house.The Greens are enthusiastic about the proposed tax, and in fact want it to kick it on balances of $2million and above, not $3million.\\xa0Crossbencher senators David Pocock and Jacqui Lambie last year refused to support Labor's plan to tax unrealised gains, meaning the government could only rely on the Greens in the Senate.\\xa0Shadow treasurer Ted O'Brien this week said the Coalition would be open to negotiating with the government on super provided it dropped plans to tax unrealised gains and indexed the $3million threshold.'When it comes to all policies, including this one, the Coalition will always be open however that doesn't mean a blank cheque,' he told Sky News.'If indeed, Jim Chalmers wants to come and have a discussion with the Coalition about his super tax, he would have to firstly walk away from the unrealised capital gains component, at least.'He should be compromising on indexation. Now, if he caves in on all of those things and wants to talk about super reform, let's have a chat about super reform.'\\xa0 The Coalition has confirmed it would consider passing Labor's superannuation policy provided it dropped a plan to slap a new 15 per cent tax on unrealised gains on balances above $3million But Chalmers argued his Coalition counterpart had kept on changing his position.'I've seen the comments that they've been making publicly, including, I think my opposite number said today that they weren't interested in negotiating,' he said.'He's disagreed with himself. He had a different view yesterday or the day before.'While Parliament is unlikely to sit again until next month, Labor is hoping to pass the Treasury Laws Amendment (Better Targeted Superannuation Concessions and Other Measures) Bill and have it backdated to July 1.\\xa0Accountants argue taxing unrealised gains would stop self-managed super funds from investing in assets that can quickly appreciate in value, such as technology start-ups; starving that sector of funds.\\xa0AMP calculated that refusing to index the $3million threshold for inflation would see the average 22-year-old worker today subject to the tax in four decades' time, even if compulsory employer super contributions stayed constant.They are rising to 12 per cent on July 1, up from 11.5 per cent.\", 'location': 'AUS', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Chalmers rejects Coalition talks on super tax\\nENTITIES: Jim Chalmers, Anthony Albanese, Coalition, Labor, Greens, Ted O'Brien, David Pocock, Jacqui Lambie\\nEVENT: Treasurer Chalmers indicated Labor will not negotiate with the Coalition on superannuation tax plans, preferring to work with the Greens.

Mbeumo has indicated that he would like to join United over the likes of Arsenal and Newcastle United, with the winger set to cost around £60million.So, if United were able to add Mbeumo to their ranks, how could the 25-year-old and Cunha perform under Amorim next season? Let's take a look...Man United's 2025/26 season simulated with Cunha and MbeumoTo set up this simulation, we used Football Manager 2024 to sign both Cunha and Mbeumo before simulating the 2025/26 season, and this is how the two attackers performed in their debut season at Old Trafford.Article continues belowUnited started the season with Cunha and Mbeumo in a front three with either Joshua Zirkzee or Rasmus Hojlund, but Amorim wasn't impressed by his strikers, with Zirkzee being loaned out in January while Hojlund was dropped. Mbeumo spent the second half of the season as a striker, and it paid off, with the Cameroon international ending the campaign as United's top goalscorer.Manchester United's top scorers from the 2025/26 season(Image: Football Manager 24)In 35 appearances across all competitions, Mbeumo scored 19 goals and grabbed three assists, with the 25-year-old impressing in his first season at the club. Cunha also performed to the level expected of him, with the Brazilian scoring 10 and assisting 10 in 36 games.\\u200cFernandes was United's best player in the simulation though, with the midfielder grabbing 21 goal contributions while averaging a rating of 7.53 per game, the highest in the United squad and the third highest in the Premier League. At the end of the 2025/26 season, Football Manager 2024 put together an overall best Man United XI, based on performances, statistics, and other metrics. This is what it looked like:Manchester United's best XI from the 2025/26 season(Image: Football Manager 24)Full United best XI: (3-4-2-1): Onana; Yoro, De Ligt, Shaw; Amad, Mainoo, Fernandes, Mazraoui; Mbeumo, Cunha; Zirkzee.\\u200cFernandes joined Cunha and Mbeumo in the front three of United's best XI, with Amorim deploying his captain as a right winger in the second half of the season. Amad played most of the season as a wing-back, while Lisandro Martinez stayed fit all season long to join Matthijs de Ligt and Lenny Yoro at the back.With their new-look attack, United were a better team in the 2025/26 campaign, and that was proved in the Premier League as Amorim's side finished seventh, eight places higher than last season.Man United finshed seventh in the Premier League during the 2025/26 season(Image: Football Manager 24)Article continues below15 wins, 13 draws and 10 losses saw United pick up 58 points in the simulation, four points fewer than Aston Villa in sixth and 12 points off the Champions League places.But, United did thrive in the FA Cup though, with both Cunha and Mbeumo getting on the scoresheet as Amorim's side beat Man City 2-1 in the FA Cup final to secure a spot in the Europa League.

Once again, Nintendo has solidified itself as the king of co-operative gaming with the latest console technically including two controllers in the box with it possible to use the Joy-Cons individually.However, if you want to play local co-op games with up to four people, or maybe want to give your guests a more comfortable gaming experience on full-sized pads, you'll need to invest in a spare set of controllers. While the options of new Switch 2 controllers are a little hard to come by at launch, there are a few great choices still available to you.I've rounded up all the best Nintendo Switch 2 controllers you can currently pick up on launch day. I'll also walk you through how third party controllers work, as well as backwards compatibility with any old devices you might have lying around.Joy-Con 2's - £74.95The new Joy-Con 2's have a C button for Chat functionality.(Image: Nintendo)The Nintendo Switch 2 comes equipped with two of its larger, magnetic Joy-Cons in the box, but you can pick up a spare set for an additional £74.95 if you so choose. These are a great option if you want to quickly boost your controller count to four, as turning them on their side means they can be used individually for a quick game of Mario Kart World.While the original Switch's Joy-Cons were a little fiddly to use in this way, the newer model is much more ergonomic in the hand thanks to the increased size of the new console. The ZL and ZR buttons are also more prominent thanks to their metal construction, so they feel much more premium in the hand than before.The only downside to these controllers is that you'll need to regularly swap them in and out of your Switch 2 console to keep them charged up as they can't be powered by a cable like most traditional pads. Alternatively, you could opt to pick up a charging dock for the Joy-Cons, like this one from Amazon for £19.79.Here are all the best links to purchase a spare set of Joy-Con 2's right now:My Nintendo Store - £74.95Amazon - £74.95The Game Collection - £74.95Very - £74.95HMV - £74.95Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller - £74.95The new Switch 2 Pro Controller has back paddle buttons.(Image: Nintendo)If you're looking for a more premium gaming experience while playing the Nintendo Switch 2, your best option is the latest Switch 2 Pro Controller. This pad ditches the portable features of the Joy-Con's in favour of a more traditional build and layout, with proper handle grips to make for a comfortable play session.The big new addition with this latest version of the controller is the inclusion of some remappable paddle buttons on the rear of the controller. These can be set to any of the other controller inputs, like the face buttons for example, letting you perform actions without ever having to take your thumbs off the sticks.It's a feature that players of competitive games like Splatoon will surely enjoy, but it's also great for some of us more laid-back single-player gamers who always find ourselves opening up the map or inventory menus. Mapping things like start and select to the back mean you can access these menu's much more quickly, making for a more enjoyable gaming experience as a whole.Of course, picking up this controller only adds one additional option to your arsenal, which might not be ideal if you're keen on playing four player Mario Kart. But it is the most premium option available right now, and ideal if you're someone who intends to play a lot of Nintendo Switch 2 in docked mode.Here are the best links to pick up a Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller right now:Amazon - £74.95TheGameCollection- £74.95Nintendo Switch Pro Controller - £49.20The original Switch Pro Controller works on the Nintendo Switch 2.(Image: Nintendo)Looking to save a bit of cash? The original Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller is also compatible with the Switch 2 hardware.That's great news for those who already have one lying around, but it's also great if £74.99 sounds like an extortionate price to shell out for a controller. You can still pick up the original Switch Pro Controller for £49.20 at Amazon, saving you a bit of cash.The main downside is that this version of the controller doesn't have the remappable paddle buttons that the newer version has, and it's also missing that new C button to open the Game Chat menu. However, it does still retain that traditional design that docked players will surely appreciate on longer gaming sessions.I'm also particularly a fan of the translucent design this controller has with the inner workings semi-visible through the outer casing. If nothing else, it looks great on a shelf.Here are all the best links to pick up a Nintendo Switch Pro Controller right now:Amazon - £49.20My Nintendo Store - £59.99Argos - £49.99Original Switch Joy-Cons - £58.99Original Joy-Cons work on the Nintendo Switch 2.(Image: Nintendo)Just like the original Pro Controller, Nintendo has confirmed that the original Joy-Con controllers will be compatible with the Switch 2. This is fantastic news if you have a few controllers left over from the last generation, as you can keep these around as fall-back options for when player's two, three and four come round.New versions of the original Joy-Cons are also available for slightly less than the newer models, setting gamers back £58.99 instead of £74.99. However, bear in mind that these controllers are a lot smaller than the new models and a little cramped to use for extended play sessions.You're also missing out on the new C button to open the Chat menu that's included on the new controllers. Additionally, some Nintendo Switch 2 games might not be playable with the old controllers if it requires use of exclusive features like the Mouse Controls.You could opt to pick up a set of pre-owned models for even cheaper, but this carries a pretty big risk of Joy-Con drift, an issue that plagued these controllers for years following the Switch's initial release. If you want the best chance of having these controllers last you a while, it's best to pick up a new set.The good news is that there are several funky colour schemes to choose from since the controllers have been out for almost a decade now. Here are the best links to pick up a set of new Joy-Cons:Amazon - £58.99My Nintendo Store - £69.99Argos - £59.99Currys - £59.99Some third-party controllers may work, but your mileage may varySome third-party controllers may work, but your mileage may vary.(Image: PowerA)Nintendo hasn't yet clarified whether third party controllers that work with the original Nintendo Switch will work with the Switch 2. However, if the original Joy-Cons and Pro Controller are compatible, it's likely that third party devices may also work without too much of a hitch.Again, it's worth considering the sort of games you're going to be playing on Switch 2 before picking up a third party controller. Games that use Mouse Controls won't be compatible with anything other than Joy-Cons 2, and older controllers wont have the C button for Game Chat.Your mileage may vary here, so it could be worth waiting a little while until we get full confirmation that existing third party controllers will work on the new hardware. If you're willing to take the risk though, here are some of the most popular third party Switch controllers from the last few years:PowerA Enhanced Wireless Gamepad - was £37.65, now £28.20ECHTPower Switch Controller - was £19.99, now £16.14VOYEE Wireless Switch Controllers - was £21.99, now £19.998Bitdo Ultimate 2C Bluetooth Controller - £28.87More third-party controllers are coming soonMore third-party controllers are coming soon for the Nintendo Switch 2.(Image: Smyths)As the Nintendo Switch 2 has only just launched, official third party controller options are a little thin on the ground.

Mr Stride will attempt to win back the trust of voters on the economy as the Tories fight to escape their third-place position in many polls.He will acknowledge the damage to the economy and the party’s reputation, saying: “For a few weeks, we put at risk the very stability which Conservatives had always said must be carefully protected. The credibility of the UK’s economic framework was undermined by spending billions on subsidising energy bills, and tax cuts, with no proper plan for how this would be paid for.”Mr Stride will acknowledge “damage to our credibility” is not “easily undone,” adding: “That will take time. And it also requires contrition.”Insisting that the upheavals of the past will not return, he will say: “So let me be clear: Never again will the Conservative Party undermine fiscal credibility by making promises we cannot afford.”Mr Stride will argue the 2022 crisis was “in part born of exasperation with the failure of successive governments to put us on a path back to sustained growth and rising living standards”.“Many feel that the system only works for the benefit of others, for large corporations, or people from other countries, but not for them and their families,” he will say. “We must accept that for too long governments of both colours have failed to free us from this malaise.“For our party to find a path back to regaining trust, we must show that we are serious about listening to people and creating a better future underpinned by a credible plan.”The Shadow Chancellor will also use his speech to fire a shot at Nigel Farage’s Reform UK, declaring: “Their economic prescription is pure populism. It doubles down on the ‘magic money tree’ we thought had been banished with Jeremy Corbyn.“They would plough ahead with huge additional welfare spending, as well as tax cuts, with no plan for how to pay for any of it. We must be radical in our prospectus, but that must be grounded in the principles of stability and responsibility.”Looking ahead to next week’s spending review, he state: “By borrowing hundreds of billions more than the plans she inherited and pushing up the rates we pay on that borrowing, Rachel Reeves has added nearly £80bn to our expected debt interest bill over the course of this parliament. At the spending review next week, we can expect her to trumpet all of the additional projects and programmes she is funding – without mentioning the fact it is all being paid for from borrowing.”Adamant there is still a role for the Tories, he will say: “When other parties are descending into a race to the bottom on economic credibility and responsibility, the Conservative Party is needed now perhaps more than ever. But to win that fight we will need thoughtfulness.“We will need to take our time if we are to forge a credible plan that delivers for the people of our country. Over the next four years our party will do just that.”Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice rejected Mr Stride's criticism, saying: “We’ll take no lectures on economics from a party that more than doubled the national debt, raised taxes and government spending to 70-year highs and shrank economic growth to 70-year lows... They can never be trusted again.”\", 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Tories seek to banish Truss-era economic turmoil\\nENTITIES: Mel Stride, Liz Truss, Keir Starmer, Nigel Farage, Reform UK, Jeremy Corbyn, Rachel Reeves, Conservatives\\nEVENT: Mel Stride will deliver a speech acknowledging the damage caused by Liz Truss's mini-Budget and outline the Conservative Party's plan to regain economic credibility, while also criticizing Reform UK's economic policies.\\nCONTEXT: Stride attempts to regain economic trust after Truss's turmoil.\", 'createdAt': '2025-06-05T08:04:47.658Z'}, {'id': 105560, 'sourceId': 12619, 'url': 'https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/oscar-bobb-stance-man-city-31789765', 'title': 'Oscar Bobb stance on Man City future ahead of busy transfer window', 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T07:00:00.000Z', 'content': 'Manchester City forward Oscar Bobb was asked about a loan move away from the Etihad after a difficult year with injuries08:00, 05 Jun 2025Oscar Bobb at WembleyOscar Bobb is determined to stay at Manchester City next season to fight for his place in Pep Guardiola\\'s team. The forward saw the makings of an excellent season ruined by injury, and was left out of the final matchday squad of the campaign at Fulham with others preferred.Pep Guardiola was not happy about having a bigger squad inflated by arrivals in the January transfer window that meant he had to leave players out, although that did not mean that those who were left out were happy. The City manager was asked about Jack Grealish not playing in the final week of the season but extended it to the rest of his squad.\\u200c\"There is not one player in my locker room, and I think all the locker rooms in and around the world, that they are happy or they are not happy, or have bad faces, because players don\\'t play.

That is a normal position in all the clubs.\"With Bobb failing to make much of an impact on the team after recovering from a number of injury issues that wiped out most of the season, he faces increased competition for a place.

Despite this, it’s still a brilliant all-rounder for the home, with stylus support, decent cameras, a great screen and processing power that doesn’t disappoint.With a 45% discount, it’s hard to turn your nose up at the humble Tab S9 FE Plus, particularly if you’re after an Android slate that's a midway device between a phone and a laptop.The Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE Plus was a fairly good deal when it first released in October 2023, offering a much more competitive balance of cost and features than its Tab S9, S9 Ultra and S9 Plus counterparts. Still offering an included stylus and a gorgeous screen, but with resolution and size cut back, the original AU$999 was a great fit for many casual users looking for a more capable tablet with a larger screen than those in Samsung’s Tab A range. It’s why I love this discount so much – it’s a Galaxy Tab S at a Galaxy Tab A price, and it gives similarly priced iPads a run for their money.In terms of processing power, it’s lower-spec than the standard Galaxy Tab S9 range, fitted with the Exynos 1380 chip instead of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 (along with only 6GB RAM in the model above). Visuals won’t pop as nicely with the S9 FE Plus’s 1600 x 2560 screen, but it’s not bad image quality at all and is perfectly fine for a hobbyist artist.In our Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE Plus review, we were impressed by its incredible battery life and loved that it came with an IP68 rating. We also appreciated the inclusion of a stylus, though we did note that it's not particularly powerful for gamers or folks looking to do some serious work. Additionally, the Galaxy Tab S10 FE range may be newer, but AU$548 for the slightly older model is hard to beat.Just keep in mind that Samsung’s only committed to four years of software updates with the Galaxy Tab S9 range, and five years of security updates – now down to two and three years respectively, as the model family has been out for a while. The tablet will continue to function for some time after these support periods, but just be aware that you’ll be shopping for a new device around that time (this was a sticking point of the Galaxy Tab S10 range, which will receive seven years of updates).Keen for more discounts?

They first overcame the Tampa Bay Lightning in five games before recovering from 2-0 down to secure a 4-3 victory over the table-topping Toronto Maple Leafs. In the Eastern Conference finals, Paul Maurice’s side eased to a 4-1 series victory over the Carolina Hurricanes to reach their third straight Stanley Cup Final. Seeking their second straight title, they’ll be looking for big performances from in-form goalie Sergei Bobrovsky and center Sam Bennett.Just like the Panthers, the Edmonton Oilers also finished third in their division before knocking out both of the sides that finished above them. In the first round, they dispatched the Los Angeles Kings in six games before overcoming the Vegas Golden Knights in five games. In the Western Conference final, they again needed just five games to advance as they dominated the Dallas Stars. Now presented with a chance to avenge last year’s Finals defeat, they’ll need Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl to be at their very best throughout the series.How to watch Stanley Cup Finals 2025 with a free trialThough there are no free live streams for the Stanley Cup Finals, there is a free trial available for new subscribers.

I felt that they don’t see me as a person, a mum, a nanna, they just see the uniform, the black vest.\\u200c“But this is just an excuse and should not give people the right to hurt and assault us.

A call no family wants to receive.“What he did to me is permanently in the back of my mind, every call I go to, I feel the apprehension, the fear that any incident no matter how innocuous it appears, can end with being assaulted or hurt.

That would lower its deposit facility rate to 2%, and would be the eighth cut in a year.A cut looks nailed on, after inflation across the eurozone fell to 1.9% last month, below the ECB’s 2% target for the first time since last September.Markets are pricing almost a 100% probability of a quarter-point cut, reports Ronald Temple, chief market strategist at Lazard Asset Management, adding:\\nWith ongoing declines in inflation and consistently dovish language from ECB members, a rate cut appears to be a done deal. The ECB has previously described 1.75%–2.25% as the range that would be considered neutral monetary policy. Any signals of a change in this view would be surprising.\\nI continue to expect rates to be reduced to 1.5% by year end given a more aggressive US trade posture against the European Union. Markets suggest a slightly less dovish outlook with rates ending the year just below 1.6%.”\\nToday, investors will also be interested to hear the ECB’s latest forecasts – economists expect cuts to its growth and inflation projections for next year.The ECB may also signal that it could pause its rate cutting cycle over the summer, before reassessing the situation in September.Christine Lagarde can also expect questions about her claim last month that the euro could take on a more global role, as the dollar loses influence amid the current trade turmoil.Lagarde’s future could also come up, following claims that she has discussed cutting short her term as European Central Bank president to become chair of the World Economic Forum.The agenda\\n7am: German factory orders for April\\n9am BST: UK new car sales report for May\\n9.30am BST: UK construction PMI report\\n1.15pm BST: European Central Bank interest rate decision\\n1.30pm BST: US trade data for April\\n1.30pm BST: US weekly jobless claims data\\n1.45pm BST: European Central Bank press conference\\nKey events20m agoUK car sales: What the experts say43m agoPhoto: Reynolds and Šefčovič in Brussels45m agoUK construction firms cut jobs at fastest pace since August 20201h agoŠefčovič calls for WTO reform following Trump attacks1h agoUK car sales rise, but Tesla sales slide2h agoMitie Group in takeover bid for Lord Ashcroft-founded Marlowe2h agoCar tax error overstated UK inflation, ONS admits2h agoWizz Air shares tumble after plane groundings hit profits3h agoUK fintech Wise to switch main stock market listing to New York3h agoGerman factory orders rise unexpectedly3h agoIntroduction: ECB expected to cut interest rates todayShow key events onlyPlease turn on JavaScript to use this featureUK car sales: What the experts sayHere’s some reaction to this morning’s data showing that UK car sales rose in May, but Tesla registrations slumped by a third.Ian Plummer, commercial director at Auto Trader:\\n“Despite recent geopolitical volatility, the fundamentals of the car market remain sound and the sharp rise in electric vehicle sales against last year demonstrates real momentum. Electric demand is being driven by new affordable models like the Renault 5 and the Hyundai Inster, along with fast growing Chinese brands like BYD and OMODA-JAECOO, which will be key to mass market adoption.\\nAround one in four of all new cars viewed on our website is electric and we know that when the price is right, drivers are keen to make the switch.”\\nJohn Cassidy, managing director of sales at Close Brothers Motor Finance:\\n“A slight uptick in new registrations could provide manufacturers with some optimism following a tough 6 months.\\n“Electric vehicle (EV) registrations continue to grow at a strong pace; though fleet registrations still skew the numbers, which still fall short of the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate targets. However, despite increased taxes and the removal of incentives, consumer appetite for EVs does appear to be increasing, boosted by an influx of new models coming to the market as Chinese manufacturers gain a larger market share. If the Government is to achieve its targets, it needs to ensure it doesn’t introduce any further measures which could deter potential EV buyers.”\\nJames Hosking, managing director of AA Cars:\\n“The UK’s new car market delivered a solid performance in May, with registrations climbing as the industry begins to find its feet following a challenging start to the year. This growth suggests that buyers are slowly regaining confidence, aided by lower interest rates and attractive new car offers.\\n“The May uplift likely reflects a combination of pent-up demand from earlier in the year, strong fleet appetite, and the pull of the new 25-plate registration. These factors often combine to lift sales around this time of year, particularly for company cars and business fleets looking to take advantage of tax efficiencies.\\n“Private buyers remain more cautious, but the gradual improvement in borrowing conditions is helping to reduce monthly finance costs, making new models more accessible to a broader audience. It’s a fragile recovery, but a recovery nonetheless.\\nSue Robinson, chief executive of the National Franchised Dealers Association (NFDA):\\n“The impact of pressures such as Employers’ National Insurance, the extension of Vehicle Exercise Duty and the Expensive Car Supplement to electric vehicles will be closely monitored moving forward as well as the uncertainty regarding the blocking/unblocking of US tariffs.\\n“Looking ahead, we are likely to see pressure on the new vehicle market, due to weak economic growth. We expect electric vehicles sales to continue to increase, however they still remain someway off the ZEV Mandate targets for 2025. Over many years franchised dealers have proven their resilience and this current period of economic turbulence is no difference.\\n“NFDA is looking ahead to the Government’s Spending Review next week and it provides a prime opportunity to clarify its objectives to reach the ZEV Mandate and wider net zero targets.”\\nPhoto: Reynolds and Šefčovič in BrusselsBritish trade secretary Jonathan Reynolds (left) and European Commission vice president Maros Šefčovič chatting at the European Policy Centre conference in Brussels today Photograph: Lisa O'CarrollUK construction firms cut jobs at fastest pace since August 2020Ouch. UK construction companies are cutting jobs at the fastest rate since the first Covid-19 lockdowns.Employment numbers across UK construction firms fell at the fastest pace since August 2020 last month, as builders shed workers following a slowdown in activity.The use of subcontractors fell by the most since May 2020.The latest S&P Global UK Construction PMI, just released, also shows that activity fell at a slower rate last month, as output and new orders both continued to decline.House building was the weakest-performing segment, indicating that the government’s efforts to drive a surge of new homes is struggling.The construction PMI has risen to 47.9 in May, up from 46.6 in April, showing that the sector shrank again, but at a slower rate (50 points signals stagnation).Tim Moore, economics director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, says:\\n“The construction sector continued to adjust to weaker order books in May, which led to sustained reductions in output, staff hiring and purchasing. However, the worst phase of spending cutbacks may have passed as total new work fell at a much slower pace than the near five-year record in February.\\nHousing activity was the weakest-performing segment in May as demand remained constrained by elevated borrowing costs and subdued confidence. Commercial work was close to stabilisation after a marked decline in April, suggesting that fears about domestic economic prospects have abated after the initial shock of US tariff announcements.\\nConstruction output continues to trudge along, last month at a slightly less dismal pace than previous months, largely due to commercial work picking up its workload. Meanwhile, new housing sped up its output descent in response to weak demand. As a result the construction sector… pic.twitter.com/qLYOTPEd54— Emma Fildes (@emmafildes) June 5, 2025Lisa O'CarrollUK trade secretary Jonathan Reynolds has also called for reforms of the WTO, including changes to the much criticised dispute resolutions system which can also take years to settle disputes between trading nations.Reynolds told the European Policy Centre security conference in Brussels:\\n“We do recognise that reforming and repositioning the WTO so that it can respond more effectively to the challenges of today is the only way to safeguard long term stability and growth tomorrow.\\n“Our eyes are fixed on greater flexibility in decision making, greater openness in the east of plurilaterals and building a fully functioning dispute settlement system,”\\n“Whilst the world has changed, it is changing, and it’s going to change more quickly in future, and that climate is uncertain and volatile.”\\nArguing stronger ties with the EU and other allies were now more vital than ever, Reynolds added:\\n“the trees that survive the storms aren’t the tallest. They’re the ones whose roots are intertwined with their lives.\\nŠefčovič calls for WTO reform following Trump attacksLisa O'CarrollThe EU’s trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič has called for deep reform of World Trade Organisation rules in the face of the continuing assault on the global rules based system by Donald Trump.Just days after a series of meetings with the US, India, Australia and others, he said many developed economies were agreed that it was long overdue, my colleague Lisa O’Carroll reports from Brussels.While the US trashes the rules based system, the rest of the world is pushing ahead with strengthening, but changing trade rules, was his message.Šefčovič says:\\n“Just in the past two days, during the OECD trade ministerial [summit] the message was clear and unequivocal – deep reform of the World Trade Organisation is long overdue and urgently needed to match today’s realities.”\\nSpeaking at the European Police Centre conference in Brussels, Šefčovič said the EU was “doubling down on the rules-based approach to trade” rather than joining Trump’s attack on decades old trading systems.While the US seeks to coerce trading partners into deals, the EU was keeping an orderly position with the aim to improving prosperity, Šefčovič insisted, saying “We are here to improve the system, not to bend it to the point of breaking and certainly not to abandon it.”He added the EU’s approach was this:\\n“We negotiate. We do not isolate. We do not leave the table… trade agreements are more than transactions. They are upgrades that empower our partners, helping them grow with us and creating a cycle of shared prosperity.”\\nHe also warned that “China’s impressive rise must not come at the expense of the European economy” and that the EU was “rebalancing this relationship and establishing a level playing field in trade and investment, with symmetrical market opening.”Earlier this week, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey warned MPs that “the rules-based system is sort of dead”, which would have very serious consequences for the global economy unless policymakers can rebuild it.UK car sales rise, but Tesla sales slideThe UK car market has returned to growth, new data shows, but sales of Teslas have fallen by a third.Overall car registrations rose by 1.6% in May, to 150,070 units, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). That’s the strongest May for new car sales since 2021, but 18% below pre-Covid levels.The SMMT points out that this is only the second month of growth this year, “reflecting brittle consumer confidence and economic turbulence”.May was another difficult month for Tesla. Registrations fell by 36% year-on-year, the SMMT reports, with just 2,016 cars sold, down from 3,152 in May 2024.That’s despite rising demand for battery-powered cars, with BEV registrations up by a quarter year-on-year, to 32,738, up from 26,031 in May 2024.Chinese electric carmaker BYD grew its UK registrations by 400% year-on-year, up from 596 last May to 3,025 this year.Tesla has faced a consumer backlash this year due to Elon Musk’s support for Donald Trump – although Musk has been savaging Trump’s tax and spending bill this week – and for Germany’s far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party.But demand for Teslas has also weakened ahead of a refresh of its popular Model Y car.A Tesla spokesman told The Times yesterday that demand for the new version of the Model Y, which was Europe’s bestselling car as recently as 2023, would boost sales in June when UK deliveries start.Mitie Group in takeover bid for Lord Ashcroft-founded MarloweOutsourcing group Mitie Group has launched a £366m takeover bid for smaller rival Marlowe.Mitie, which provides security, cleaning and engineering services to public sector clients and private companies, has agreed a cash and share deal with Marlowe, which produces business-critical services and software.Marlowe was co-founded by former Conservative Party deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft, and Alex Dacre, son of former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre.The deal values Marlowe’s shares at 466p. They’ve jumped by 8% this morning to 439p, having already surged yesterday following reports that the two companies were in talks.Phil Bentley, chief executive officer of Mitie, says the deal will help Mitie transform into a “Facilities Compliance provider”:\\nWith growing legislation around Fire, Security and Water & Air Quality, our clients need a partner who can also offer a broad range of Facilities Compliance capabilities. In a growing Testing, Inspection and Certification (TIC) market valued at £7.6 billion per annum, Marlowe stands out as a leader in Fire & Security and Water & Air and Asbestos compliance.\\nAdding Marlowe’s c.3,000 highly respected colleagues to Mitie’s capabilities and providing access to Mitie’s clients will generate significant revenue growth opportunities as well as immediate cost efficiencies.\\nMarlowe shareholders will get 1.1 New Mitie Shares and 290p in cash once the deal goes through. Mitie’s shares have fallen by 10% this morning, which will erode the value of the deal.Lord A owns 19.5% of Marlowe’s shares, so he should receive around £44m in cash plus shares in Mitie worth roughly £25m.Car tax error overstated UK inflation, ONS admitsThe UK’s Office for National Statistics has admitted that UK inflation was overstated in April, due to an error in car tax data provided by the British government.The consumer price inflation rate was overstated by 0.1 percentage points for the year to April, the ONS reports, because of an error in the Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) data provided by the Department for Transport, which is used to calculate consumer prices inflation.The incorrect data overstates the number of vehicles subject to Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) rates applicable in the first year of registration.This helped to push UK CPI inflation up to 3.5% in April, higher than expected.The error could be expensive, as it also added 0.1 percentage points to the retail price index, which is used to set payments on index-linked UK government bonds.The ONS does not plan to revise its inflation data, but will use the correctly weighted data now on, meaning no further statistics will be affected.Wizz Air shares tumble after plane groundings hit profitsBudget airline Wizz Air has reported a plunge in profits, after almost a fiifth of its fleet were grounded last year due to engine problems.Wizz Air’s shares have dropped by 24% this morning, after it reported that operating profits fell by 61% to €167.5m in the last financial year.Wizz says it was “a year of significant challenges”, as an average of 44 aircraft were parked during the year, owing to issues with Pratt & Whitney’s Geared Turbofan (GTF) engines, which power many of its Airbus A320NEO planes.József Váradi, Wizz Air’s CEO, says:\\n“I describe our fiscal year F25 with two words: resilience and transformation.\\nIn an environment where rare challenges have become recurrent, Wizz Air has evolved structurally, embedding increased flexibility into our standard operating model. While often dismissed as ‘easier said than done,’ the past year’s events tested both our company and management. We emerged stronger, wiser, and better prepared.”\\nMay was the busiest month for UK house sales since March 2022, new data from Rightmove this morning shows.Across Great Britain, the number of sales agreed is now 6% ahead of the same period last year, Rightmove reports. But London is lagging, with sales just 1% higher than a year ago. Photograph: RightmoveMay is typically a busy month in the year for agreed sales, and last month’s was the busiest May since 2021.Rightmove argues that May’s data suggests market conditions have improved, as home-movers carry on following the stamp duty increase at the start of April.UK fintech Wise to switch main stock market listing to New YorkUK fintech Wise has joined the ranks of companies looking to migrate to the US stock markets.Wise, which floated in London less than four years ago, told shareholders this morning that it plans to switch its primary listing to New York, the latest blow to the London market.Wise’s CEO, Kristo Käärmann, told the City:\\nAs part of our next step on that journey, today we are announcing our intention to dual list our shares in the US and UK. We believe the addition of a primary US listing would help us accelerate our mission and bring substantial strategic and capital market benefits to Wise and our Owners.\\nThese include helping us drive greater awareness of Wise in the US, the biggest market opportunity in the world for our products today, and enabling better access to the world’s deepest and most liquid capital market.\\nWise was formerly known as TransferWise, which became the largest tech listing in the UK when it was valued at nearly £9bn after its 2021 stock market debut.Käärmann adds that Wise plans to maintain a secondary listing on the London stock exchange, saying:\\n“A dual listing would also enable us to continue serving our UK-based Owners effectively, as part of our ongoing commitment to the UK. The UK is home to some of the best talent in the world in financial services and technology, and we will continue to invest in our presence here to fuel our UK and global growth.”\\nSeveral other UK-listed companies have recently shifted their listing to New York, including construction rental company Ashtead Group, and gambling giant Flutter.German factory orders rise unexpectedlyGerman factory orders have jumped unexpectedly, defying forecasts that they would fall as Donald Trump’s tariffs disrupted trade.Orders at German manufacturers rose by 0.6% in April, official data this morning shows, beating forecasts of a 1% fall.Statistics body Destatis also reported that foreign orders declined by 0.3%, despite a 0.5% rise in orders from within the eurozone. Domestic orders increased by 2.2%.Demand for data processing equipment, electronic, and optical products increased, while there was also a rise in new orders for transport equipment, and for metal products.Introduction: ECB expected to cut interest rates todayGood morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy.Interest rates across the eurozone are likely to be cut today, as the European Central Bank attempts to support the euro economy as it reels from the damage caused by Donald Trump’s trade wars.The ECB is widely expected to cut its key interest rates by a quarter of one percentage point.

A new law will require certain organizations to disclose when and how much they have paid to cybercriminals following a data breach. However, experts remain unconvinced that this is the most effective way to tackle the problem.\\nCompanies operating in Australia must now report any payments made to cybercriminals after experiencing a ransomware incident. Government officials hope the new mandate will help them gain a deeper understanding of the issue, as many enterprises continue to pay ransoms whenever they fall victim to file-encrypting malware.\\nOriginally proposed last year, the law applies only to companies with an annual turnover exceeding $1.93 million. This threshold targets the top 6.5 percent of Australia\\'s registered businesses – representing roughly half of the country\\'s total economic output.\\nUnder the new law, affected companies must report ransomware incidents to the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD). Failure to properly disclose an attack will result in fines under the country\\'s civil penalty system.\\nAuthorities are allegedly planning to follow a two-stage approach, initially prioritizing major violations while fostering a \"constructive\" dialogue with victims.\\nStarting next year, regulators will adopt a much stricter stance toward noncompliant organizations. The Australian government has implemented this mandatory reporting requirement after concluding that voluntary disclosures were insufficient. In 2024, officials noted that ransomware and cyber extortion incidents were vastly underreported, with only one in five victims coming forward.\\nRansomware remains a highly complex and growing phenomenon, with attacks reaching record levels despite increased law enforcement actions against notorious cyber gangs. Although several governments have proposed similar regulations, Australia is the first country to formally enact such a law.\\nJeff Wichman, director of incident response at cybersecurity firm Semperis, cautions that mandatory reporting is a double-edged sword. While the government may gain valuable data and insights into attacker profiles, the law may not reduce the frequency of attacks.\\nInstead, it could serve mainly to publicly shame breached organizations – while cybercriminals continue to profit.

His work, especially his watercolours of demi-monde life in interwar Paris and New York, is a distinct and vivid record of the times. His paintings are held in major institutions – as is his extensive archive, which is housed at Tate Britain in London.And yet he remains “one of the great known unknowns of modern British art”, according to Thomas Kennedy, the curator of a new retrospective show at Tate Britain. It is being held more than half a century on from Burra’s last show at the Tate in 1973, three years before he died aged 71. There are lots of reasons for Burra’s “unknown” status, explains Kennedy. “He worked alone, and not being part of a defined group doesn’t help to place an artist. But probably more important is the fact he absolutely hated talking about his work.” Kennedy cites some excruciating documentary footage (also from the early 1970s) illustrating Burra’s painful reluctance to engage with questions about art. “He just hated that stuff and would call art ‘fart’ and things like that. Apparently, he walked through that Tate show as if wearing blinkers, not looking at the work and just wanting to get it over with.”The exhibition runs alongside a parallel show of works by Ithell Colquhoun, another radical British artist who, like Burra, challenged artistic conventions and explored parallel ideas of identity and sexuality in surrealist work that often reflected her occult beliefs.The two defining features of Burra’s early life – he was born in 1905 – were the wealth of his family (prominent in banking) and the fact he suffered from extremely poor health. This combination resulted in him later being able to travel – to France and Spain, the United States and Mexico – then return home to Rye in East Sussex, where he spent most of his life, to recuperate after his exertions and paint the things he had seen.His illnesses – rheumatoid arthritis and the blood disease spherocytosis among other conditions – also helped dictate the nature of his art in that it was physically easier for him to work with watercolours flat on a table than with oils at an easel. “As a watercolourist he pushed the boundaries of a traditionally delicate medium to create bold graphic works, rich in detail,” says Kennedy.His illness also informed his empathy for those on the fringes of society and in his subject matter he engaged with some of the 20th century’s most significant social, political and cultural events. “After Paris in the roaring 20s and the Harlem Renaissance, he sort of pivoted to depict the violence of the Spanish civil war and then the second world war, before taking on British landscapes and reflections on postwar industrialisation and environmental degradation.”While Burra was publicly reticent about his art, the Tate show’s exploration of his archives serves to deepen understanding of the man. As well as letters there are his gramophone records – mostly jazz – books and calendars he kept that show his obsessive cinema-going, sometimes seeing several films a day in French and German as well as English.“Bringing these sources together is quite revealing,” says Kennedy. “It all adds to the tapestry of his influences and what emerges is a socially conscious art that is warmly satirical while also being willing to confront the darker side of life.”Travelling man: five of Edward Burra’s key worksEdward Burra’s Three Sailors at a Bar, 1930. Photograph: Todd White Art Photography/Edward Burra/Lefevre Fine ArtThree Sailors at a Bar, 1930Burra’s sexuality is ambiguous, but his work in the 20s and 30s often reflected queer culture and sensibility. While this image of a bar in the south of France is among his more explicitly queer work, it also reflected a general sense of sexual liberation among Burra’s circle in the roaring 20s.Minuit Chanson, 1931 (main image above)In this Parisian music shop where you could pay to listen to a gramophone record, Burra’s vibrant street scene celebrates its diverse clientele.

It’s not impossible, especially with several lower-half teams and their tacticians still exploring the options available.So let us take a moment, before it is forgotten, to celebrate the 2024-25 campaign. It will be remembered above all for Napoli’s fourth scudetto, and Antonio Conte becoming the first manager to win Serie A with three clubs; or the second, after Fabio Capello, for those who continue to reject the decision to strip Juventus of their 2005 and 2006 triumphs as punishment for Calciopoli scandal.Party time in Naples as Gli Azzuri lift the scudetto.

ReutersLewis Ferguson, essential to Bologna’s Champions League qualification a year ago, missed much of this season through injury but returned to captain his team to glory in the Coppa Italia – their first domestic trophy in more than half a century. Liam Henderson was relegated with Empoli, but Josh Doig is in line to replace him in Serie A after helping Sassuolo to promotion.From top to second-bottom, this was an intensely competitive campaign. Not only the title race but places in every European competition and the final two relegation spots were all decided on the final weekend. For a moment it had even appeared that the top two might need to be separated by a playoff.There were too many twists and turns to recall here, but certain images will linger in the memory.

Photograph: Aflo Co. Ltd./AlamyInter pursued every trophy and finished with none. They were even outdone here by their frequently dreadful neighbours, Milan, who came from 2-0 down to beat them in the Supercoppa final, the culmination of an astonishing first week in charge of the Rossoneri for Sérgio Conceição, whose team nevertheless finished eighth in the league.His predecessor, Paulo Fonseca, had begun the season saying Milan were aiming to win the scudetto. By week three, he could not even persuade Rafael Leão and Theo Hernández to stand with their teammates during a cooling break.Fonseca got plenty wrong, yet none of his missteps was so shameful as the ones his club made on the night they fired him – allowing him to give a post-game press conference at which everyone seemed to know his fate except for him. Finally informed of his termination shortly after, he had to announce it to journalists on the way out of the car park, since the club had still not released a statement.Instead of Milan, it was Atalanta who threatened to muscle in on the title race, winning 11 games in a row before fading to third. Bologna, Roma, Lazio and Fiorentina had turns at challenging for fourth. They were beaten to it by Juventus, who broke a habit and changed manager with the season ongoing. Tudor drove more than 600 miles from his home in Croatia to take the job. His choice, and the club’s, was vindicated.Dusan Vlahovic helped fire Juventus to Champions League qualification. Photograph: Chris Ricco/Getty ImagesThe relegation battle was similarly close-fought, all apart from Monza, who started and finished poorly under Alessandro Nesta. They were equally bad when Salvatore Bocchetti replaced him for seven games in the middle. Selling several starters in January did not help, but the Berlusconi family have made clear they are no longer interested in sustaining a loss-making football club, and are seeking a new buyer.Venezia, too, paid the price for mid-season trading – unable to find a replacement goalscorer after Joel Pohjanpalo left for Palermo. Empoli join them in dropping down to Serie B, overtaken at the last by a Lecce side for whom the goalkeeper Wladimiro Falcone was the hero. The team from the heel of Italy’s boot will play a fourth consecutive season of top-flight football for the first time.Again, though, we are getting ahead of ourselves.

Lucca buried it into the top corner but was snubbed by his colleagues and subbed off before half-time. “Nobody’s bigger than the team,” the manager Kosta Runjaic said at the time. Not even their 6ft 7in top scorer.Player of the seasonMcTominay is the easy, and correct, choice. There were others who deserve a mention: Mateo Retegui’s 25 goals for Atalanta were six more than anyone else managed, Nico Paz was electric for Como and Kean produced the best season of his career for Fiorentina.But McTominay stood up repeatedly in key moments for a Napoli team who rarely had the luxury of an easy three points, winning 13 times by a goal. At first the “Jolly”, whose adaptability allowed him to fit in where the team needed, by the end McTominay had become the man that the whole system was built around, following the departure of Kvaratskhelia.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionTeam of the season (3-4-1-2)Mile Svilar (Roma); Amir Rrahmani (Napoli), Berat Djimsiti (Atalanta), Alessandro Bastoni (Inter); Riccardo Orsolini (Bologna), Tijjani Reijnders (Milan), Scott McTominay (Napoli), Mattia Zaccagni (Lazio); Nico Paz (Como); Mateo Retegui (Atalanta), Moise Kean (Fiorentina)Player I’m most annoyed not to have squeezed into that XI: Marcus Thuram (Inter)One of Scott McTominay’s many spectacular celebrations for the scudetto winners.

Returning to a club that had already gone through two managers by mid-November, his first league games in charge were against Napoli and Atalanta. His Giallorossi lost both, beat Lecce then suffered another defeat away to Como.For the remaining 22 rounds of the season after that, though, Ranieri’s Roma were statistically the best team in Serie A – taking 53 points. The closest sides behind them in this stretch, Inter and Napoli, managed 47 each.Claudio Ranieri feels the love of Rome. Photograph: Angelo Carconi/EPARoma ultimately fell a point short of the Champions League places, but even qualifying for the Europa League was a major achievement given the mess he inherited. His most lasting impact might simply have been to heal rifts between the club and a fanbase who were outraged by the ownership’s treatment of Daniele De Rossi.Honourable mentions: So, so many. It feels outrageous not to give the prize to Conte for taking over a Napoli team who finished 10th last season, and who sold Kvaratskhelia without a replacement in January, having already sent the other great hero of their 2023 scudetto win, Victor Osimhen, off to Galatasaray on loan.But I also want to acknowledge the work done by Gian Piero Gasperini at Atalanta. His methods at times seemed questionable – labelling Ademola Lookman “one of the worst penalty takers I’ve ever seen”, but the results are undeniable.Atalanta lost their starting No 9, Gianluca Scamacca, to a cruciate ligament tear in August and were without one of their brightest young talents, Giorgio Scalvini, for most of the season too. Teun Koopmeiners was sold to Juventus in the summer and Lookman missed the start of the campaign amid reports that he, too, was lobbying for a transfer. Despite all that, Atalanta finished third, again.Fàbregas also did impressive work at Como, but I wanted to highlight Raffaele Palladino, too. He reinvigorated the careers of so many players this year at Fiorentina – from Kean to Robin Gosens and David De Gea and even navigated a traumatic chapter for his club with Edoardo Bove’s cardiac arrest. Having chosen to walk away at the end of the season, it will be fascinating to see where Palladino lands next.Saves of the SeasonFiorentina’s David de Gea pulls out three in a row against Como.Game of the SeasonThe Derby d’Italia in October, when Inter led 1-0 then trailed 2-1, led 4-2 and ultimately drew 4-4 against Juventus was an utterly unhinged game of football, as well as a magical one for the then 19-year-old Kenan Yildiz, who scored the last two goals. We should have known then that Inter were no longer the trustworthy defensive unit we watched last season. “The neutrals like you enjoyed yourselves,” Inzaghi said to a giddy Sky Sport studio at full-time. “Me, a little bit less.”Best pilotChristian Pulisic.Worst foreshadowing“The mental side of the game will be fundamental,” the then-Lecce manager Luca Gotti said before his team hosted Fiorentina in October. They lost 6-0, with Antonino Gallo sent off before half-time.Toughest loveAfter taking over at Juventus in March, Tudor told a press conference he had already heard from one player’s famous father: “I spoke to Lilian Thuram yesterday on the phone. He told me: ‘If my son Khéphren does anything wrong, you can slap him.’”Most unimpressedLilian Thuram again, this time watching his older son, Marcus, score against his own former club, Parma.Greatest struggleNapoli fans trying to say Scott McTominay’s name (before they came up with something better.Italian fans found it easier to write Scott McTominay’s name than to say it, leading to a host of nicknames for the midfielder. Photograph: Remo Casilli/ReutersWorst excusesConte and Napoli finished as scudetto winners, but that didn’t stop him from getting in a few classic moans along the way. Greatest among them might have been his lament that “the pitch was not watered, and the ball wouldn’t run” after a 0-0 draw at Venezia. “It’s the first time something like this has happened all year. I asked [Venezia manager] Eusebio [Di Francesco] if that was their choice but he said it wasn’t.” The broadcaster Dazn responded on Venezia’s behalf, posting a video of the pitch being watered on four separate occasions, before kick-off and at half-time.Guy Goma Gong for mistaken identityDown 1-0 at home against Lazio in April, Atalanta sought to change the dynamic of the game by replacing the midfielder Éderson with the more attacking Lazar Samardzic. Unfortunately, Mirco Moioli, responsible for conveying substitutions to the fourth official, misheard Gasperini’s instruction to take off “Ede” as a call to replace “Ade” – the forward Ademola Lookman. By the time they realised, the board had gone up and it was too late to do anything about it. As Gasperini observed at full-time: “You could see this wasn’t our day.”Final thoughtI’ve saved the last word this season for Ranieri, reflecting on Roma’s 1-1 draw with Lazio in April. That result, earned from a losing position, allowed him to retire undefeated as a manager in Rome derbies. But it also was the first one he had failed to win.“I thought about that before and after,” Ranieri said. “As a fan it’s very beautiful to finish undefeated, though I would have liked to close with one more win. But this is football: sometimes it gives you beautiful things, other times less beautiful.

Watchmakers like Rolex are already responding by boosting their prices. But as the price of new watches goes up, a silent revolution is happening in the secondhand market. This is mostly because Gen Z and millennial shoppers are buying used watches not just to save money but also to invest.The levy, which is part of a larger trade dispute that affects Swiss goods, will go into force in July.The Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry said that exports of Swiss timepieces to the US rose by more than 149% year-on-year in April as brands tried to meet the deadline. Still, many customers will probably feel the effects in the next few months when stores pass on higher import costs to them.Rise of Young BuyersThe changing market is good for established resellers like Bob's Watches, a California-based marketplace for used watches. Douglas Kaplan, the Chief Commercial Officer, told Business Insider that Bob's Watches' sales went up by 20% from March to May because 'supply stability' and younger customers were coming into the market.Kaplan said that they're in no 'hurry to raise prices' because 90% of their stocks are from the US and are therefore not affected by the tariffs on imports.Kaplan also said that if the prices of new models keep going up, sellers in the secondhand market may likewise want more money for their used items.The demographic change is what stands out the most. The luxury watch market is changing because younger, more price-conscious buyers are entering it. It used to be only for rich collectors and experienced watchmakers. More and more, millennials and Gen Z see timepieces as long-term investments instead of just fashion accessories. Many people are choosing used items that have a story, are rare, and in certain situations, might even go up in value.A 2024 Deloitte analysis on luxury trends found that more than 40% of Gen Z shoppers were willing to buy second hand luxury items. The survey said that sustainability and cost were two of the main reasons why. McKinsey's global analysis, on the other hand, says that the market for used luxury watches might grow to £47 billion by 2029, almost doubling in size in only ten years.This shift in generations isn't just about being cheap. It also shows that people are becoming more financially savvy and looking for real assets.Factors Behind the ShiftThe motivations of Gen Z and millennial buyers vary: some are drawn to the heritage and exclusivity of discontinued models, while others are treating watches as tangible, appreciating assets in uncertain economic times.Industry executives point to a confluence of factors : rising global wealth, fuelled in part by stock market gains and the crypto boom; the explosion of watch-focused content on YouTube, Reddit, and enthusiast sites; and the pervasive influence of social media. Instagram and TikTok, in particular, have transformed Swiss timepieces into status symbolsRolex and other high-end Swiss manufacturers are dealing with geopolitical problems by raising prices and changing their supply chains. On the other hand, resellers like Bob's are riding a wave of change in the generations. Because tariffs are likely to make the market even tighter, the secondhand segment, which has always been considered as secondary, is swiftly becoming the main topic of conversation about luxury watches.It's not just about telling time for young shoppers; it's about getting ahead of it.\", 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Pre-owned watch market booms amidst tariff hikes\\nENTITIES: Rolex, Bob's Watches, Gen Z, Millennials, Switzerland, Douglas Kaplan\\nEVENT: US tariffs on Swiss watches are increasing prices, leading younger buyers to the secondhand market, boosting sales for resellers like Bob's Watches.\\nCONTEXT: Tariffs and generational shifts drive pre-owned watch market.\", 'createdAt': '2025-06-05T08:04:47.658Z'}, {'id': 106121, 'sourceId': 12662, 'url': 'https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/are-american-tariffs-hurting-china-this-netizen-saying-i-think-were-probably-doing-even-better-1735044', 'title': \"Are American Tariffs Hurting China?

It's about how these policies are altering everyday lives and supply chains, often in unexpected ways.A recent TikTok from a woman in China suggests that, contrary to popular belief, China might not be the one suffering — in fact, she argues, they're thriving.\\nThe Changing Face of Chinese Grocery ShoppingThe woman, identified as Emily, a Canadian living in China, shared her experience in a local grocery store. Her video begins with a straightforward statement: 'Hello from China. So, I'm in a grocery store right now, and I wanted to show you how the American tariffs are affecting Chinese customers.' She then proceeds to hold up a package of beef, highlighting a significant change.Where once American beef sat on the shelves, now Australian beef takes centre stage. 'What used to be here is American beef,' she explains. 'But now, as you can see, it says Australian beef.' She mentions that she searched for American beef but couldn't find a single pack; instead, Australian and other alternative sources have filled the gap.Trade Diversification or Market Reactions?This isn't an isolated trend. According to trading data, China's reliance on US imports is relatively low, with figures suggesting only about 7% of Chinese imports came from America in 2023. The USDA reported that the US exported approximately £1.3 billion (roughly $1.6 billion) worth of beef to China in 2024. Meanwhile, soybeans — once China's top US import — are now increasingly sourced from Brazil, as US market share diminishes.Emily points out that China isn't just replacing American beef with Australian options; it's doing so with better quality and at a more competitive price. Her £5 (around $7) package of Australian beef was cheaper than what might have been available before the tariffs, and she expressed confidence in its quality. 'Honestly, because of the food quality, I probably trust Australian beef better,' she adds.The US Perspective: Are Tariffs Backfiring?This narrative challenges the idea that American tariffs are hurting China. While US export numbers have declined, China's ability to find alternative suppliers seems unaffected, if not strengthened. The American tariffs have prompted a shift in sourcing, leading to less dependence on US products in the Chinese market.Some commentators online have echoed this sentiment, pointing out that 'no country is hurting apart from the US'. Others suggest that the tariffs have pushed China to diversify its supply chains, making it less vulnerable to US trade policies in the long run. A Twitter user even stated that 'Trump trying to beef up American exports actually led to losing customers to export to,' highlighting the unintended consequences of tariff policies.Who's Really Suffering?In the end, the idea that tariffs are hurting China might be misplaced. While American farmers and exporters face challenges, the Chinese market appears resilient, actively seeking alternatives that suit their needs. This real-world example indicates that the impact of US tariffs is more complex than headlines suggest.Rather than crippling China, these trade policies seem to be nudging the country towards diversification. And in doing so, they may be making China less dependent on American goods, which could alter the global trade landscape for years to come. As Emily's grocery store experience shows, sometimes the most telling signs of economic shifts are right in the shopping baskets of everyday consumers.\", 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Tariffs shift China imports away from US\\nENTITIES: China, United States, Australia, Emily, USDA\\nEVENT: Tariffs shift Chinese beef imports from US to Australia.\\nCONTEXT: Tariffs may be pushing China to diversify trade.', 'createdAt': '2025-06-05T08:04:47.658Z'}, {'id': 106330, 'sourceId': 12680, 'url': 'https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/836117/kate-middleton-honest-5-word-verdict-prince-william/', 'title': \"The Princess of Wales' brutally honest 5-word verdict on Prince William before meeting\", 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T05:15:00.000Z', 'content': 'Long before their paths officially crossed at St Andrews University, it seems the Princess of Wales already had a rather strong opinion about her future husband, Prince William.\\xa0Back in 2017, reports emerged from Kate\\'s school days at Marlborough College that shed light on her early perceptions of Prince William.\\xa0According to her close school friend, Jessica Hay, who was the girlfriend of Prince William\\'s mentor at Eton, Nicholas Knatchbull, Kate had a particular admiration for the royal even then.\\xa0© Max Mumby/IndigoPrincess Kate met Prince William during their university daysThe Telegraph reports that Jessica revealed that while she and her friends would \"sit around talking about all the boys at school we fancied,\" the future Queen Consort\\'s focus was elsewhere.\\xa0\"But Catherine would always say, \\'I don\\'t like any of them… there\\'s no one quite like William.

The crew, unable to contain it, sent a distress alert 15 minutes later, the London-based shipping company said in a statement.All 22 crew members left the 600-foot ship on a lifeboat and were rescued by a nearby commercial vessel, the Coast Guard said in a statement.A spokeswoman for the Coast Guard said that it was allowing the fire to burn out and watching from a safe distance because of the risk that lithium-ion batteries in the cars could explode.The agency plans to investigate the cause of the fire, said the spokeswoman, Petty Officer First Class Shannon Kearney of the Coast Guard’s 17th District in Alaska. She said it was too soon to conclude that the fire started from the electric vehicles.Electric vehicles contain lithium-ion batteries that can overheat and cause fires that spread rapidly and produce toxic gases, making them difficult and dangerous to extinguish.The Morning Midas was carrying 3,000 cars, including 800 electric vehicles, and had been expected to arrive at Lázaro Cárdenas in Mexico on June 15, according to Zodiac.The ship left Yantai, China, on May 26, and stopped at Shanghai and Nansha, two major hubs for Chinese electric vehicle exports, before setting off across the Pacific, according to Maritime Optima, a shipping data provider based in Norway.Imports from China dominate the electric vehicle market in Latin America. More than 60 percent of electric vehicles sold in Mexico in 2023 and 2024 were from China, according to the International Energy Agency.The dangers of battery fires can be greater at sea, where saltwater could corrode the materials covering a battery and ignite a larger flame.In 2022, the Felicity Ace, a car carrier slightly larger than Morning Midas, sank in the Atlantic Ocean along with around 4,000 vehicles — including Bentleys and Porsches — after a fire onboard burned for nearly two weeks.Lithium-ion batteries also pose risks to air travel. In recent months, Southwest Airlines and several carriers in Asia have tightened in-flight restrictions on the use and transport of the batteries. The bans in Asia went into effect after a fire destroyed a passenger jet at an airport in South Korea in January.There is no definitive link between portable batteries and that fire, and an investigation is underway.Francesca Regalado is a Times reporter covering breaking news.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Cargo ship carrying EVs burns off Alaska\\nENTITIES: U.S. Coast Guard, Zodiac Maritime, Morning Midas, China\\nEVENT: A fire broke out on a cargo ship carrying electric vehicles off the coast of Alaska.

While in office, Biden and his aides dismissed concerns abut his mental acuity, but he ultimately stepped aside as the Democratic presidential candidate after a disastrous debate against Trump in June last year magnified concerns.

His administration has accused the schools of allowing antisemitism and facilitating the spread of pro-Hamas propaganda by permitting the campus protests, which free-speech advocates say are protected by the First Amendment.What To Know\"I have determined that the entry of the class of foreign nationals described above is detrimental to the interests of the United States because, in my judgment, Harvard\\'s conduct has rendered it an unsuitable destination for foreign students and researchers,\" Trump said in his Wednesday order.The president\\'s directive stems from Harvard\\'s refusal to submit to the administration\\'s demands to change its hiring and admission policies and eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, among other issues.Trump\\'s battle with the Cambridge, Massachusetts, university has also intensified in recent days after the school refused his administration\\'s request for records related to foreign students\\' misconduct.\"Protecting our national security requires host institutions of foreign students to provide sufficient information, when asked, to enable the Federal Government to identify and address misconduct by those foreign students,\" Trump said in the proclamation. \"In my judgment, it presents an unacceptable risk to our Nation\\'s security for an academic institution to refuse to provide sufficient information, when asked, about known instances of misconduct and criminality committed by its foreign students.\"\\nStudents from Harvard University\\'s Kennedy School attend the all-university commencement on the Harvard campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on May 29.\\nVCG via AP Images\\nWhat People Are SayingRepublican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana on X, formerly Twitter, on Wednesday: \"Harvard went so far woke that they violated our civil rights laws.

It imperils the futures of thousands of students and scholars across Harvard and serves as a warning to countless others at colleges and universities throughout the country who have come to America to pursue their education and fulfill their dreams.

Gay church members were said to be very distressed.Article continues belowPointing to the code this week, the Kinross-shire Kirk member said: “The approach appears to be to annotate the vacancy with a ‘D’ to indicate that the parish in question is departing from the Church of Scotland stance – and to permit applications from ministers in same-sex relationships.“It is interesting that the majority on the current list are opting to depart, which makes the recent Kinross-shire decision even more out of step.“The use of the red “D” to distinguish between vacancies for which gay ministers may or may not apply, strikes me as weak and cowardly and a further tactic to try and draw as little attention as possible to the issue.\\u200c“The church, he continued, should state quite clearly in job adverts what it means and not hide behind the initial D.He added: “If the church is comfortable and confident in its stance, why not have the courage to be honest and transparent by having two separate categories in their vacancy register: one for vacancies where all can apply and a second where applications from gay ministers are excluded? I suspect we know the answer.”In 2013 the Church of Scotland’s General Assembly narrowly agreed to allow congregations to vote on admitting gay and lesbian ministers.\\u200cIt followed a four-year controversy after openly gay minister Scott Rennie was voted Minister Elect at Aberdeen’s Queen’s Cross Church in 2009.This spring Rev Rennie was appointed minister at St Giles’ Cathedral in Edinburgh.In 2009 Kinross Parish Church minister Alan Reid was among those who signed an online petition opposing Scott Rennie’s appointment along with eight other Perth and Kinross ministers.\\u200cHowever, opening the inaugural Perthshire Pride in 2019, the then minister of Perth’s St Matthew’s Church, the Rev Scott Burton, told the LGBTQ event that the Church of Scotland apologised for any “cruelty and injustice” caused.The General Assembly had endorsed a call the previous year to “take stock of its history of discrimination at different levels against gay people” and to apologise “individually and corporately.”Vacant Church of Scotland charges open to candidates in same-sex relationships include churches in Ayrshire, Glasgow, Fife, Stirlingshire, Angus, Aberdeenshire and the West Highlands as well as international Scots Kirks in Paris and Lausanne and Christ Church Bermuda.Article continues belowA Church of Scotland spokesperson said: “The Church has affirmed its traditional doctrine on marriage, but permits congregations to depart from it as a matter of liberty of opinion.“The page on the Church of Scotland website where ministers can find the list of vacant charges clearly states: ‘If the charge is marked with a *D* this means that the congregation has departed from the Church’s traditional position in respect of Ministers in civil partnership and same sex marriages, in so far as it has been mentioned in the Parish Profile.’”', 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Church job ads use code for gay ministers\\nENTITIES: Kinross Parish Church, Church of Scotland, Scott Rennie\\nEVENT: A Kinross-shire Church of Scotland member revealed a code in job adverts indicating whether gay ministers are welcome to apply, sparking controversy.\\nCONTEXT: The Church of Scotland permits congregations to depart from traditional marriage doctrine.', 'createdAt': '2025-06-05T08:04:47.658Z'}, {'id': 106869, 'sourceId': 902, 'url': 'https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/corfu-visitors-hit-back-after-35339106', 'title': \"Corfu visitors hit back after gran's Greek holiday rant on 'no British food' at hotel\", 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T06:17:39.000Z', 'content': 'Susan Edwards, who shared her frustration that Lido Corfu Sun Hotel on the Greek island didn\\'t serve English food, s wil vows never to book a holiday with TUI again07:17, 05 Jun 2025Susan Edwards said she had a \\'nightmare\\' holiday(Image: Iain Buist/Newcastle Chronicle)A holiday row has erupted after a British gran slammed a Corfu hotel after not serving enough \"proper English food.\"Susan Edwards, 69, from Westerhope, Newcastle, blasted the Lido Corfu Sun Hotel for its Mediterranean menu, claiming there weren\\'t enough chips and she became \"sick to death of looking at rice\", reports the Mirror.\\u200cHowever, regulars at the hotel have hit back at the British gran, taking to Tripadvisor and Google Reviews to defend their beloved resort and insisting that Ms Edwards\\' criticism is unfair.\\u200cThe hotel boss also defended the menu, describing the offerings as \"generous and diverse\", and said \"fresh salads, fruits, hot and cold dishes\" are served daily.One guest became so enraged they left their first-ever Tripadvisor review to brand other guests as \"pathetic chavs\".(Image: Iain Buist/Newcastle Chronicle)Article continues belowThe account, created only this month seemingly in response to the row, rated Lido Corfu Sun Hotel as five stars out of five.

The Apple Watch Series 10 takes everything great about its predecessors and elevates it. Compared to the Series 9, it offers a larger, brighter screen without adding bulk (it\\'s actually lighter), more power under the hood and faster charging than any other Apple Watch, including the Ultra 2.While its features may not drastically differ from the Series 9, its next-gen processor ensures it will likely outlast its predecessor in terms of software updates. It also includes a few more subtle upgrades, like voice isolation for calls, music playback and a depth gauge with a water temperature sensor for aquatic activities.Best Apple Watches for 2025 Pros\\nIncredibly light on the wrist\\n1Hz refresh rate = ticking second hand!\\nVoice isolation on calls is excellent\\nBigger screen makes readability better on the smaller size case\\nSleep apnea notifications at launch\\nCons\\nNo improvements to battery life\\nNo significant changes to Double Tap\\nSmallest 42-mm size might still be too big for some wrists\\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 takes a winning formula and updates it for the Apple Watch\\'s tenth birthday. It is slimmer and lighter than earlier Apple Watches, with two new case sizes: 42 millimeter or 46 millimeter. The wide-angle OLED screens make the watch brighter when looking at it off-axis. And the LTPO3 technology also brings a ticking second hand to the always-on display. The Apple Watch Series 10 also comes with sleep apnea notifications, which can detect signs of this potentially dangerous condition over a 30-day period.Battery life is still rated for 18 hours although you can push it to a day and a half with lighter use. The Apple Watch Series 10 now has even faster charging though, which makes up for the battery life somewhat, able to charge to 80% in 30 minutes. Overall, it\\'s an incredibly polished smartwatch and the best choice for most iPhone owners.Why we like itThe Series 10 is a refined version of its predecessors on the surface and under the hood. It’s lighter and slimmer than the Series 9 but has a larger, brighter screen that’s easier to read from every angle. It has the most powerful processor of the entire Apple Watch lineup and, as a result, longer shelf life for software updates. Plus it comes with additional perks, like the ability to play music through the speaker and background noise reduction during calls.Who it’s best forThe Series 10 is ideal for most iPhone users upgrading from an existing Apple Watch, or anyone deeply invested in the Apple ecosystem who wants a premium smartwatch experience out of the box (including the latest health sensors). It brings enough upgrades to feel like a true step up, while retaining all the features that make the Apple Watch great. \\xa0... Show more Get it now Add to compare Pros\\nLower price\\nSame performance as the Series 8\\nCar-crash detection for additional safety\\nCons\\nNo always-on display\\nNo QWERTY keyboard\\nMost new features can be found on older watches too\\nThe Apple Watch SE retails for $250 but you can regularly find it discounted to $200 or less, which makes it an excellent choice for the budget-conscious buyer. Expect most of the same features found on more expensive Apple Watch models like the Series 9, including activity tracking, third-party apps and safety features like Emergency SOS. It does miss out on an always-on display and heart-health features like the ECG.Why we like itThe second-generation SE offers all the essential features you’d want from an Apple Watch for at least $150 less than what you’d pay for the cheapest model of the Series 10. It covers everything you need, including advanced health and fitness tracking, crash and fall detection, and seamless integration with your iPhone.Who it’s best for\\xa0This is a great option for first-time Apple Watch buyers or anyone upgrading from a much older model (Series 0–4), as it’ll still feel like an upgrade without making you feel like you’re missing out on newer features like the always-on display or advanced health sensors like ECG or temperature tracking, which you never had in the first place. It’s also the best option for children (LTE model) as a way to stay connected with parents or caregivers without having to go all in on a smartphone. \\xa0... Show more Add to compare Pros\\nIncredibly bright screen\\nMore accurate dictation and on-device Siri\\n64GB storage means more space for music and apps\\nDouble Tap is very useful\\nCons\\nBattery life is the same as first Ultra\\nLimited recovery metrics\\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 2 is Apple\\'s best smartwatch, with a tough titanium construction and an Action button to quickly start workouts or launch apps. It has the brightest screen of any Apple Watch at a maximum of 3,000 nits that makes it incredibly easy to see when adventuring in the great outdoors. For adventurers and athletes, it also has a built-in siren for safety and a dual-band GPS for accurately tracking your route. LTE is also onboard so you can venture out without a phone and still stay connected.Although it\\'s designed to be an outdoor watch, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is still a fantastic all-around smartwatch. Inside is the same S9 chip as found on the Apple Watch Series 9 which supports gestures like Double Tap and allows the watch to process Siri commands on-device. This means you can use Siri without being online and later in the year you\\'ll be able to ask the voice assistant for health data. Like earlier Apple Watches, the Ultra 2 also comes with a blood oxygen sensor, electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) app, fall detection and emergency SOS. The battery also lasts at least twice as long as all other Apple Watch models. It\\'s only compatible with the iPhone so if you have an Android phone, you\\'ll want to look at another option on this list.Why we like itThe Apple Watch Ultra 2 is an all-terrain smartwatch that’s built to go the distance with nearly twice the battery life of other Apple Watches (three days on a charge), and a durable, titanium exterior. It has a larger screen than other models and an action button that can be programmed for easy access no matter what the conditions.

The new watch replaces last year\\'s Apple Watch Series 9 and is the best Apple Watch for most people.All Apple Watches share the same core DNA: a square screen with rounded edges, a rotating crown, interchangeable straps and Apple’s WatchOS with Siri integration. The differences lie in the details with factors like advanced health sensors, durability, battery life and screen size. Oh, and price. Lisa Eadicicco/CNETBudget: If you\\'re on a budget and want the best deal, it might be worth waiting for major discount days like Black Friday when most retailers, including Apple, offer sales or gift-card cash-back incentives. Another way to cut costs is by purchasing a refurbished Apple Watch directly from Apple. They come with the same one-year warranty as new models, eligibility for AppleCare and a 14-day return window.Design: There are a lot of ways to customize your Apple Watch, including different finishes and watch bands. But dressing up your Apple Watch doesn\\'t always come cheap and some of the more premium design options like the titanium finish and stainless steel band can increase the base price by $600. You can also customize the size of your screen; older models or the 2nd SE will have the smallest option (40mm) while the Apple Watch Ultra offers the largest (49mm) display.Battery: Battery life continues to be a major pain point for Apple Watch users, with no model going past the three-day mark like some Android models. And while Apple has made strides in this category, it\\'s best to taper your expectations by accepting that you’ll probably get a day\\'s worth of charge (with the always on display) on most models. If that’s a deal breaker, you\\'ll need to splurge on the Apple Watch Ultra 2, which is the only model that lasts up to 72 hours. Jeff Carlson/CNETWi-Fi Only vs. Cellular: Most users will find the Wi-Fi version sufficient. It tracks workouts and makes mobile payments independently from the phone but needs to be in range of your iPhone to access some of the smart features like notifications, messaging and calls. Cellular and Wi-Fi models are only worth the splurge (an additional $100) if you plan to ditch your iPhone on a regular basis and need the watch to be a standalone device and have access to all the features. And it\\'s your only option if you’re buying the Ultra 2 as it doesn’t offer a Wi-Fi only option.We test all our Apple Watches in the real world and focus on any new features or claims in addition to all the other features you’ll be using on a regular basis like fitness tracking and connectivity. All Apple Watches, including the cellular models, need to connect to an iPhone so we also assess how easy the companion software is to navigate. Carly Marsh/CNETDurability and design: Smartwatches are something you wear on your body so we assess how comfortable they are to wear. We also know that everyone has a different-sized wrist so we try to see how it fits and feels on a variety of people.\\xa0Then we look at how it stands up to wear and tear with daily life. Some models, like the Ultra 2, offer increased durability like dust resistance or water resistance that\\'s suited for activities like scuba diving and, where possible, we\\'ll test this out for ourselves.Battery: Battery life will vary depending on how you use a smartwatch so we test battery life with a few standard tests. We see how long it generally lasts on a single charge with features that represent typical use, like the always-on display, sleep tracking and doing one outdoor workout with GPS. Yes, you can take calls, talk to Siri, or use the Walkie Talkie feature to chat with your friends and family who also have Apple Watches, but you might get some funny looks. Charles Wagner/CNETFitness and health sensor accuracy: We test the accuracy of the Apple Watch using a few different methods. The heart rate sensor, for example, is compared against the readings taken from a chest strap, considered the gold standard in consumer heart rate tracking, during a variety of cardio-based activities like running or cycling. We also check to see how long it takes to connect to a GPS signal when doing an outdoor workout. Other health sensors, like a blood oxygen sensor (not active on newer models), are compared against a pulse oximeter for spot readings where possible, and for the ECG feature, we tested it against a hospital grade ECG.While no longer sold directly by Apple, the Apple Watch Series 9 is still a strong option if you can find it. Stores like Best Buy and Target often have it in stock for about $100 less than the Series 10. You’ll miss out on the larger, redesigned screen and ultra fast charging but it still includes key health features not available on the cheaper SE, like the ECG app, temperature sensing and sleep apnea notifications. What is the best alternative to an Apple Watch? Unless you\\'re ready to switch from your iPhone to an Android device, it\\'s best to avoid Wear OS watches like Samsung’s Galaxy Watch or Google’s Pixel Watch, as they offer limited compatibility with Apple devices. Instead, consider watches that run proprietary operating systems, such as Garmin’s Venu 3 or Huawei’s Watch Fit 3. Garmin is known for its fitness-focused models for athletes but they also offer solid smartwatch features. The Amazfit Active 2 is also worth considering for a simpler, budget-friendly option that covers the basics.\\nShow more\\nWhat is the best Apple Watch for kids? The best Apple Watch for kids is the Apple Watch SE (2nd generation) with Wi-Fi and Cellular. A feature fittingly called \"Apple Watch for your Kids\" allows parents to set up the watch from their own iPhones without needing a separate iPhone for the child. Parents can track the location of their kid in real time and manage who their kids can contact during what times to minimize distractions during school hours. Even if you wanted to treat your kid to one of the newer models, key features like ECG, wrist temperature and sleep tracking are disabled in this mode anyway. Read more: Apple Watch for Kids\\nShow more\\nWhat to know about the blood oxygen sensor If you\\'ve purchased an Apple Watch within the past year, you may notice the Blood Oxygen feature in your app list doesn’t load. This is no coincidence. Apple introduced SpO2 (blood oxygen) tracking with the Series 6 but was forced to disable it in units sold after Jan. 18, 2024, following a patent lawsuit filed by medical tech company Masimo. According to Apple’s website the company is appealing the ruling so it’s possible this feature could make a comeback.\\nShow more\\nSmartwatches are only getting smarter about health and the Apple Watch is no exception. Whether it’s better sensors, new metrics or more personalized coaching, Apple may be taking a queue from competitors like Garmin and Google and leaning more on AI to make sense of your data to personalize insights. One trend I’d love to see the Apple Watch adopt this year is better battery life; smarter software and hardware upgrades like the dual CPU architecture on the OnePlus Watch 3 are finally making multi-day wear feel realistic. Meanwhile, the definition of a wearable is expanding fast with more smart rings making their debuts as well as upgraded earbud options with built-in health sensors that are already nudging into smartwatch territory. They probably won’t replace watches entirely but they’re definitely raising the bar and will continue giving the Apple Watch a healthy push forward.', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Apple Watch 2025: Series 10, SE, Ultra\\nENTITIES: Apple, Apple Watch Series 10, Apple Watch SE, Apple Watch Ultra 2\\nEVENT: Review of Apple Watch models highlights Series 10, SE, Ultra 2.

On Wednesday, a federal judge stopped it after the Justice Department sued and Texas agreed.In-state students at the University of Texas at Austin pay a minimum of about $10,800 for tuition per year, while the minimum cost for out-of-state students is about $40,500.Credit...Ilana Panich-Linsman for The New York TimesJune 4, 2025A federal judge in Texas on Wednesday blocked a two decade-old law offering undocumented residents the same discounted tuition as other in-state college students, after the Trump administration and the Texas attorney general joined together to argue the measure violated federal law.The one-page order, signed by Judge Reed O’Connor of the Northern District of Texas, came just hours after the federal government filed suit challenging the Texas law. Soon after, Attorney General Ken Paxton of Texas said he would not oppose the lawsuit. Instead, his office filed a joint motion with the Justice Department asking the judge to permanently block the law. With the parties in agreement, Judge O’Connor, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, quickly did so, signing the order that declared the law “invalid.” “In-state tuition for illegal immigrants in Texas has ended,” Gov. Greg Abbott declared in a social media post late Wednesday.The lawsuit had come as a surprise given that the Republican-dominated state has been more than willing to cooperate with the Trump administration on its strict approach to immigration enforcement. The case was filed in the Northern District of Texas and carried a title more familiar to legal fights over immigration during the Biden administration: United States of America v. State of Texas.But the decision by Mr. Paxton, a hard line conservative, to side with the Trump administration was not a shock. It aligned with his approach to immigration, and with his politics — even if Republicans in the state legislature had just opted against changing the law in the just-ended legislative session. Mr. Paxton is currently locked in a fierce campaign to unseat Senator John Cornyn in the state’s Republican primary next year, based in large part on the attorney general’s aggressive enforcement of immigration laws.“Ending this discriminatory and un-American provision is a major victory for Texas,” Mr. Paxton said in a statement announcing the joint motion with the Justice Department.The Texas law, known as the Texas Dream Act of 2001, was championed by governor at the time, Rick Perry. He continued to defend the action during his failed 2012 presidential run, saying those opposed it did not “have a heart.” But Republican Party has moved considerably to the right on immigration since then. “Under federal law, schools cannot provide benefits to illegal aliens that they do not provide to U.S. citizens,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement, pledging that the Justice Department would “ensure that U.S. citizens are not treated like second-class citizens.”Texas was the first state in the nation to extend in-state tuition benefits to undocumented students, according to the National Immigration Forum, an immigrant rights nonprofit. The savings can be substantial. At the University of Texas’ flagship campus in Austin, in-state students pay a minimum of about $10,800 for tuition a year, while the minimum cost for out-of-state student is about $40,500.Now nearly half the states offer undocumented applicants similar deals, but they are mostly led by Democrats, according to the Higher Ed Immigration Portal, which gathers education data. In Texas, there are tens of thousands of undocumented students in higher education, and many of them were brought into the country as young children and attended American public schools, according to the group’s data.In April, President Trump took aim at such students with an executive order targeting laws “that provide in-state higher education tuition to aliens but not to out-of-state American citizens.”The order directed Ms. Bondi to “identify and take appropriate action to stop the enforcement” of such laws. The action appeared aimed at blue states such as California.But suddenly, on Wednesday, Texas was in the cross hairs.The state’s Republican lawmakers had considered changing the law during this year’s legislative session, which ended on Monday. A bill introduced in the State Senate by a Houston-area Republican, Mayes Middleton, would have made undocumented students ineligible for in-state tuition, but it never received a full vote. A similar measure also failed in the State House.“The Texas House and Senate declined to repeal the Texas Dream Act this session because even state lawmakers recognized how out of touch that would be,” State Representative Ramón Romero Jr., a Democrat and the chairman of the Mexican American Legislative Caucus, said in a statement. “Now Donald Trump is pushing the issue even further by suing Texas for giving these students a fair shot.”Mr. Perry did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but in a 2014 interview he said it was in the best interest of the state of Texas “to give these young people the opportunity to be givers rather than takers, to be a constructive part of this society.”The law applies to undocumented students who have finished three years of high school in Texas and have lived in the state for the year before enrolling in a public college or university. The students must also sign an affidavit saying they intend to apply for permanent residency as soon as they are able.The Justice Department argues, in its complaint, that a federal immigration law from 1996 restricts the state’s authority to grant that kind of benefit to “illegal aliens.”Mr. Paxton’s office, in its joint motion with the Justice Department, said it agreed that the federal law pre-empted the state law. The Texas law recently survived a case in federal court brought by a conservative group, Young Conservatives of Texas Foundation, against administrators at the University of North Texas over the school’s tuition policy.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit dismissed the case in 2023, but focused its attention on the validity of charging out-of-state students more than in-state students, not on whether the state could grant in-state tuition to undocumented students.The order signed by Judge O’Connor on Wednesday said the parts of the law granting in-state tuition to undocumented students “violate the Supremacy Clause and are unconstitutional and invalid.” He did not offer an explanation.

Experts believe there are similar rates in other countries but only a fraction of these have been diagnosed.ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition characterised by difficulties with concentration, energy levels, impulsiveness, or by a person\\'s ability to manage their time.The study, published in the Journal of Affective Disorders, comes as a national taskforce in England is looking at what this rising demand for support means across the NHS, education and justice sectors.Figures published last week by NHS England estimated there were nearly 2.5 million people in England with ADHD, with more than 550,000 currently waiting for an assessment. Every month 20,000 more people are referred for support, a 13% rise on this time last year.NHS England has admitted patients are waiting \"too long for assessment and diagnosis\".Patient watchdog Healthwatch England has also campaigned on the issue, calling for better support.A report it published last week highlighted how ADHD can lead to people struggling in work and education and emphasised the importance of them getting a diagnosis to help understand and manage their condition.One woman, Alex, told the watchdog a diagnosis had helped her find ways to manage better and opened up access to medication which meant she was better able to care for her daughter.\"I just couldn\\'t cope with normal things or keep a routine. It made living exhausting.\"But the 32-year-old was only able to get a diagnosis after paying for private support.\"I\\'m lucky I could afford going private, but I know many people can\\'t,\" she added.Henry Shelford, of ADHD UK, said the condition had been ignored for too long.\"Increasing awareness and diagnosis is the key to unlocking the talents of over 2 million people in the UK. \"Doing so isn\\'t just good for the individual, it\\'s economically positive for the entire country.\"Prof Edmund Sonuga-Barke, a fellow at the Academy of Medical Sciences and an ADHD expert at King\\'s College London who was not involved in the research, said it was clear there had been a \"chronic under-diagnosis\" of ADHD in the UK.He said while ADHD medications were safe, there needed to be more progress in developing a greater range of non-drug treatments and therapies to help people self-manage their conditions.It comes amid criticism too many people are being placed on drugs to treat ADHD.', 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: ADHD diagnosis surge due to awareness\\nENTITIES: King's College London, NHS England, Healthwatch England, ADHD UK\\nEVENT: A study found ADHD rates stable since 2020 despite rising diagnoses, attributing the surge to increased awareness and reduced stigma.\\nCONTEXT: Increased awareness, not prevalence, drives ADHD diagnosis surge.\", 'createdAt': '2025-06-05T08:04:47.658Z'}, {'id': 107527, 'sourceId': 927, 'url': 'https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/south-koreas-liberal-led-legislature-passes-bills-calling-122522562', 'title': \"S. Korean lawmakers approve special investigations into martial law and Yoon's wife\", 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T06:37:59.000Z', 'content': 'SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea’s liberal-led legislature overwhelmingly passed bills Thursday to launch special investigations into former President Yoon Suk Yeol’s short-lived imposition of martial law in December and criminal allegations against his wife, targeting the ousted conservative a day after his liberal successor took office. The National Assembly also passed a bill to initiate an independent investigation into the 2023 drowning death of a marine during a search-and-rescue operation for flood victims, an incident the Democratic Party, which holds majority, accuses Yoon’s government of covering up.The bills previously had been vetoed by Yoon during his term and by South Korea’s caretaker government after his Dec. 14 impeachment.President Lee Jae-myung, a Democrat who won Tuesday’s snap election triggered by Yoon’s removal from office, is expected to sign the bills.Many members of the conservative People Power Party refused to participate in the votes, which took place after one of the party’s lawmakers accused the liberals of being driven by vendetta.Kim Yong-min, a Democratic Party lawmaker, said the conservatives were effectively defending Yoon’s imposition of martial law by repeatedly opposing investigations into it.“That’s why they failed to win public support and were rejected by voters in the presidential election,” he said in a speech. Lee, who drove the legislative efforts to impeach Yoon, pinned his presidential campaign on unity, promising not to target conservatives and calling for an end to political polarization. Yet Lee has vowed a full investigation into Yoon’s martial law imposition and the allegations surrounding his wife, moves that could overshadow the new government and inflame tensions as Yoon faces a high-stakes rebellion trial carrying a possible death sentence.The Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office has indicted Yoon on charges accusing Yoon of masterminding a rebellion and enacting martial law as an illegal bid to seize the legislature and election offices and arrest political opponents.Liberals have insisted independent investigations into Yoon are essential, saying probes by prosecutors, police and an anti-corruption agency were inadequate and hampered by Yoon’s refusal to cooperate. If Lee approves the independent investigations, special prosecutors could request the transfer of relevant cases to expand those investigations or direct public or military prosecutors to continue handling them under their supervision.The bills calling for independent investigations into Yoon’s martial law decree and criminal allegations involving his wife both passed by a vote of 194 to 3. Dozens of retired marines, dressed in red shirts, saluted and cheered from an observation box after lawmakers passed the bill for a special prosecutor investigation into the marine’s death, which also passed 194 to 3. Martial law lasted only a few hours after a quorum of lawmakers pushed past a blockade of hundreds of heavily armed soldiers and voted to revoke the measure. Yoon defended the move as a necessary act of governance, accusing the Democrats, whom he labeled “anti-state forces,” of abusing their majority to obstruct his agenda and paralyze state affairs.That same majority now gives Lee a far more favorable path to advance his agenda, though conservatives claim it could grant him virtually unchecked power and allow him to pass laws that shield him from legal trouble.Yoon’s wife, Kim Keon Hee, also faces multiple corruption allegations, including claims that she received luxury items from a Unification Church official seeking business favors, as well as possible involvement in a stock price manipulation scheme. She also is suspected of interfering with PPP’s candidate nominations ahead of legislative elections in April last year.While in office, Yoon repeatedly dismissed calls to investigate his wife, denouncing them as baseless political attacks.', 'location': 'KOR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: S.

While the Army has long planned for a festival on the National Mall to celebrate its 250th birthday, the parade was just recently added. President Donald Trump has long wanted a military parade in the city, after seeing an elaborate one in France on Bastille Day during his first presidential term, and June 14 is also his birthday.U.S. Rep. Salud Carbajal, D-Calif., questioned whether the additional cost of the parade was appropriate since all the military services are facing 8% budget cuts, and said perhaps it could be used to improve troops’ quality of life or warfighting capabilities. He prodded Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll on what he would prioritize if Congress wrote him a blank check for $45 million.Driscoll replied that he thinks the parade offers a chance to tell the public about the Army. “I believe very specifically that telling that story will directly lead to a recruiting boom and will fill up our pipeline for the coming years,\" he said.At the same time, he and Gen. Randy George, chief of staff of the Army, told lawmakers that the service has now met its recruiting goal for the year — with 61,000 recruits. Army officials have predicted for months that they would hit the target early after making a series of changes to recruiting programs, recruiters and policies over the past several years.That prompted Rep. Wesley Bell, D-Mo., to ask why the parade was needed for recruiting if it\\'s already surging.Driscoll said the Army believes the parade “will empower an entire new generation of America’s youth to catch the spirit to serve their nation.”Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wisc., defended the parade spending, saying “you cannot put a price tag on patriotism.” House members on both sides of the aisle pressed the Army about a recent request to shift money from across the budget to support the southern border. The biggest concern, they said, is that it takes money away from base housing, which has been plagued with persistent problems, including mold, rodents and raw sewage in barracks.Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., agreed the nation needs a strong border, but said lawmakers worked for the past year on a broad effort to address the housing problems. “I feel like a decision was made that undermined this whole effort that we spent the last year doing.,\" he said.Pressed on the issue by Carbajal, George acknowledged that redirecting the money has an impact on the barracks.“If we took $1 billion out of barracks, we would be able to fix less barracks,\" he agreed, but also said, ”“You have to make choices, congressman.\"', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Army defends parade, border spending to Congress\\nENTITIES: Army, Congress, Daniel Driscoll, Randy George, Donald Trump\\nEVENT: Army leaders defended the cost of a parade for the Army's 250th birthday and the shifting of funds to support the southern border, while Congress members raised concerns about budget cuts and the impact on base housing.\\nCONTEXT: Army leaders defend parade and border spending amid concerns.\", 'createdAt': '2025-06-05T08:04:47.658Z'}, {'id': 107605, 'sourceId': 12486, 'url': 'https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/best-apple-watch/#ftag=CADf328eec', 'title': 'Best Apple Watch for 2025', 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T01:05:00.000Z', 'content': 'The Apple Watch is a worthy iPhone companion.

The Apple Watch Series 10 takes everything great about its predecessors and elevates it. Compared to the Series 9, it offers a larger, brighter screen without adding bulk (it\\'s actually lighter), more power under the hood and faster charging than any other Apple Watch, including the Ultra 2.While its features may not drastically differ from the Series 9, its next-gen processor ensures it will likely outlast its predecessor in terms of software updates. It also includes a few more subtle upgrades, like voice isolation for calls, music playback and a depth gauge with a water temperature sensor for aquatic activities.Best Apple Watches for 2025 Pros\\nIncredibly light on the wrist\\n1Hz refresh rate = ticking second hand!\\nVoice isolation on calls is excellent\\nBigger screen makes readability better on the smaller size case\\nSleep apnea notifications at launch\\nCons\\nNo improvements to battery life\\nNo significant changes to Double Tap\\nSmallest 42-mm size might still be too big for some wrists\\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 takes a winning formula and updates it for the Apple Watch\\'s tenth birthday. It is slimmer and lighter than earlier Apple Watches, with two new case sizes: 42 millimeter or 46 millimeter. The wide-angle OLED screens make the watch brighter when looking at it off-axis. And the LTPO3 technology also brings a ticking second hand to the always-on display. The Apple Watch Series 10 also comes with sleep apnea notifications, which can detect signs of this potentially dangerous condition over a 30-day period.Battery life is still rated for 18 hours although you can push it to a day and a half with lighter use. The Apple Watch Series 10 now has even faster charging though, which makes up for the battery life somewhat, able to charge to 80% in 30 minutes. Overall, it\\'s an incredibly polished smartwatch and the best choice for most iPhone owners.Why we like itThe Series 10 is a refined version of its predecessors on the surface and under the hood. It’s lighter and slimmer than the Series 9 but has a larger, brighter screen that’s easier to read from every angle. It has the most powerful processor of the entire Apple Watch lineup and, as a result, longer shelf life for software updates. Plus it comes with additional perks, like the ability to play music through the speaker and background noise reduction during calls.Who it’s best forThe Series 10 is ideal for most iPhone users upgrading from an existing Apple Watch, or anyone deeply invested in the Apple ecosystem who wants a premium smartwatch experience out of the box (including the latest health sensors). It brings enough upgrades to feel like a true step up, while retaining all the features that make the Apple Watch great. \\xa0...

Expect most of the same features found on more expensive Apple Watch models like the Series 9, including activity tracking, third-party apps and safety features like Emergency SOS. It does miss out on an always-on display and heart-health features like the ECG.Why we like itThe second-generation SE offers all the essential features you’d want from an Apple Watch for at least $150 less than what you’d pay for the cheapest model of the Series 10. It covers everything you need, including advanced health and fitness tracking, crash and fall detection, and seamless integration with your iPhone.Who it’s best for\\xa0This is a great option for first-time Apple Watch buyers or anyone upgrading from a much older model (Series 0–4), as it’ll still feel like an upgrade without making you feel like you’re missing out on newer features like the always-on display or advanced health sensors like ECG or temperature tracking, which you never had in the first place. It’s also the best option for children (LTE model) as a way to stay connected with parents or caregivers without having to go all in on a smartphone. \\xa0...

It has the brightest screen of any Apple Watch at a maximum of 3,000 nits that makes it incredibly easy to see when adventuring in the great outdoors. For adventurers and athletes, it also has a built-in siren for safety and a dual-band GPS for accurately tracking your route. LTE is also onboard so you can venture out without a phone and still stay connected.Although it\\'s designed to be an outdoor watch, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is still a fantastic all-around smartwatch. Inside is the same S9 chip as found on the Apple Watch Series 9 which supports gestures like Double Tap and allows the watch to process Siri commands on-device. This means you can use Siri without being online and later in the year you\\'ll be able to ask the voice assistant for health data. Like earlier Apple Watches, the Ultra 2 also comes with a blood oxygen sensor, electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) app, fall detection and emergency SOS. The battery also lasts at least twice as long as all other Apple Watch models. It\\'s only compatible with the iPhone so if you have an Android phone, you\\'ll want to look at another option on this list.Why we like itThe Apple Watch Ultra 2 is an all-terrain smartwatch that’s built to go the distance with nearly twice the battery life of other Apple Watches (three days on a charge), and a durable, titanium exterior. It has a larger screen than other models and an action button that can be programmed for easy access no matter what the conditions. Extras like dual-band GPS, a built-in siren, and LTE connectivity add another layer of safety when you\\'re off the grid.\\xa0Who it’s best forOutdoor enthusiasts and serious athletes looking for a middle ground between a traditional Apple Watch and a full-fledged sport watch like a Garmin.

The new watch replaces last year\\'s Apple Watch Series 9 and is the best Apple Watch for most people.All Apple Watches share the same core DNA: a square screen with rounded edges, a rotating crown, interchangeable straps and Apple’s WatchOS with Siri integration. The differences lie in the details with factors like advanced health sensors, durability, battery life and screen size. Oh, and price. Lisa Eadicicco/CNETBudget: If you\\'re on a budget and want the best deal, it might be worth waiting for major discount days like Black Friday when most retailers, including Apple, offer sales or gift-card cash-back incentives. Another way to cut costs is by purchasing a refurbished Apple Watch directly from Apple. They come with the same one-year warranty as new models, eligibility for AppleCare and a 14-day return window.Design: There are a lot of ways to customize your Apple Watch, including different finishes and watch bands. But dressing up your Apple Watch doesn\\'t always come cheap and some of the more premium design options like the titanium finish and stainless steel band can increase the base price by $600. You can also customize the size of your screen; older models or the 2nd SE will have the smallest option (40mm) while the Apple Watch Ultra offers the largest (49mm) display.Battery: Battery life continues to be a major pain point for Apple Watch users, with no model going past the three-day mark like some Android models. And while Apple has made strides in this category, it\\'s best to taper your expectations by accepting that you’ll probably get a day\\'s worth of charge (with the always on display) on most models. If that’s a deal breaker, you\\'ll need to splurge on the Apple Watch Ultra 2, which is the only model that lasts up to 72 hours. Jeff Carlson/CNETWi-Fi Only vs. Cellular: Most users will find the Wi-Fi version sufficient. It tracks workouts and makes mobile payments independently from the phone but needs to be in range of your iPhone to access some of the smart features like notifications, messaging and calls. Cellular and Wi-Fi models are only worth the splurge (an additional $100) if you plan to ditch your iPhone on a regular basis and need the watch to be a standalone device and have access to all the features. And it\\'s your only option if you’re buying the Ultra 2 as it doesn’t offer a Wi-Fi only option.We test all our Apple Watches in the real world and focus on any new features or claims in addition to all the other features you’ll be using on a regular basis like fitness tracking and connectivity. All Apple Watches, including the cellular models, need to connect to an iPhone so we also assess how easy the companion software is to navigate. Carly Marsh/CNETDurability and design: Smartwatches are something you wear on your body so we assess how comfortable they are to wear. We also know that everyone has a different-sized wrist so we try to see how it fits and feels on a variety of people.\\xa0Then we look at how it stands up to wear and tear with daily life. Some models, like the Ultra 2, offer increased durability like dust resistance or water resistance that\\'s suited for activities like scuba diving and, where possible, we\\'ll test this out for ourselves.Battery: Battery life will vary depending on how you use a smartwatch so we test battery life with a few standard tests. We see how long it generally lasts on a single charge with features that represent typical use, like the always-on display, sleep tracking and doing one outdoor workout with GPS. Yes, you can take calls, talk to Siri, or use the Walkie Talkie feature to chat with your friends and family who also have Apple Watches, but you might get some funny looks. Charles Wagner/CNETFitness and health sensor accuracy: We test the accuracy of the Apple Watch using a few different methods. The heart rate sensor, for example, is compared against the readings taken from a chest strap, considered the gold standard in consumer heart rate tracking, during a variety of cardio-based activities like running or cycling. We also check to see how long it takes to connect to a GPS signal when doing an outdoor workout. Other health sensors, like a blood oxygen sensor (not active on newer models), are compared against a pulse oximeter for spot readings where possible, and for the ECG feature, we tested it against a hospital grade ECG.While no longer sold directly by Apple, the Apple Watch Series 9 is still a strong option if you can find it. Stores like Best Buy and Target often have it in stock for about $100 less than the Series 10. You’ll miss out on the larger, redesigned screen and ultra fast charging but it still includes key health features not available on the cheaper SE, like the ECG app, temperature sensing and sleep apnea notifications. What is the best alternative to an Apple Watch? Unless you\\'re ready to switch from your iPhone to an Android device, it\\'s best to avoid Wear OS watches like Samsung’s Galaxy Watch or Google’s Pixel Watch, as they offer limited compatibility with Apple devices. Instead, consider watches that run proprietary operating systems, such as Garmin’s Venu 3 or Huawei’s Watch Fit 3. Garmin is known for its fitness-focused models for athletes but they also offer solid smartwatch features. The Amazfit Active 2 is also worth considering for a simpler, budget-friendly option that covers the basics.\\nShow more\\nWhat is the best Apple Watch for kids? The best Apple Watch for kids is the Apple Watch SE (2nd generation) with Wi-Fi and Cellular. A feature fittingly called \"Apple Watch for your Kids\" allows parents to set up the watch from their own iPhones without needing a separate iPhone for the child. Parents can track the location of their kid in real time and manage who their kids can contact during what times to minimize distractions during school hours. Even if you wanted to treat your kid to one of the newer models, key features like ECG, wrist temperature and sleep tracking are disabled in this mode anyway.

This is no coincidence. Apple introduced SpO2 (blood oxygen) tracking with the Series 6 but was forced to disable it in units sold after Jan. 18, 2024, following a patent lawsuit filed by medical tech company Masimo. According to Apple’s website the company is appealing the ruling so it’s possible this feature could make a comeback.\\nShow more\\nSmartwatches are only getting smarter about health and the Apple Watch is no exception. Whether it’s better sensors, new metrics or more personalized coaching, Apple may be taking a queue from competitors like Garmin and Google and leaning more on AI to make sense of your data to personalize insights. One trend I’d love to see the Apple Watch adopt this year is better battery life; smarter software and hardware upgrades like the dual CPU architecture on the OnePlus Watch 3 are finally making multi-day wear feel realistic. Meanwhile, the definition of a wearable is expanding fast with more smart rings making their debuts as well as upgraded earbud options with built-in health sensors that are already nudging into smartwatch territory. They probably won’t replace watches entirely but they’re definitely raising the bar and will continue giving the Apple Watch a healthy push forward.', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Apple Watch 2025: Series 10, SE, Ultra\\nENTITIES: Apple, Apple Watch Series 10, Apple Watch SE, Apple Watch Ultra 2\\nEVENT: Review of Apple Watch models highlights Series 10, SE, Ultra 2.

He did not say how many domestic pilgrims were taking part. Last year, there were 1,611,310 pilgrims from outside the country.On Wednesday, pilgrims streamed into Arafat, some making the journey on foot, carrying their luggage through temperatures nudging 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). Others carried the elderly.People paused to sit on the ground to rest or eat before heading to their camps.Mount Arafat, a rocky hill southeast of Mecca, holds immense significance in Islam. Arafat is mentioned in the Quran and it is where the Prophet Muhammad is said to have given his last sermon on his final Hajj.According to traditional sayings of the prophet, the Day of Arafat is the most sacred day of the year, when God draws near to the faithful and forgives their sins.Pilgrims remain in Arafat, in prayer and reflection, from after midnight until after sunset. After sunset Thursday, pilgrims will go to the desert plain of Muzdalifah to collect pebbles, which they will use in a ritual.Saudi Arabia has spent billions of dollars on crowd control and safety measures, but the mass of participants makes ensuring their safety difficult. One of the greatest challenges at the Hajj in recent years has been the heat.Earlier in the week, Health Minister Fahad bin Abdulrahman Al-Jalajel told The Associated Press that 10,000 trees have been planted to provide more shade, there is increased hospital bed capacity, and the number of paramedics has tripled.\", 'location': 'SAU', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: 1.5 Million Foreign Pilgrims in Saudi Arabia\\nENTITIES: Saudi Arabia, Hajj Ministry, Ghassan Al-Nuwaimi, Prophet Muhammad\\nEVENT: More than 1.5 million foreign pilgrims are in Saudi Arabia for the Hajj.

Legal expert weighs in\\n05:51\\nPresident Trump ordered an investigation Wednesday into whether former President Joe Biden\\'s administration used an autopen machine to sign key presidential documents like pardons — months after Mr. Trump claimed his predecessor\\'s pardons were illegitimate.In a memo signed Wednesday night, Mr. Trump told Attorney General Pam Bondi and the president\\'s counsel to probe what he claimed was a \"conspiracy\" to \"abuse the power of Presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden\\'s cognitive decline.\"\\nThe order cited a litany of executive actions by Biden — including pardons and federal judge appointments — and argued \"there are serious doubts as to the decision making process and even the degree of Biden\\'s awareness of these actions being taken in his name.\"\\xa0It then suggested that if Biden\\'s advisers \"secretly used the mechanical signature pen,\" it would \"have implications for the legality and validity of numerous executive actions.\"Mr. Trump said the investigation should cover whether Biden\\'s aides \"conspired to deceive the public about Biden\\'s mental state and unconstitutionally exercise the authorities and responsibilities of the president.\" It also directed an investigation into which executive actions an autopen was used for, and who directed its use.In a statement, Biden called the attacks false and \"nothing more than a distraction by Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans.\"\"Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn\\'t is ridiculous and false,\" Biden said.Presidents have used an autopen — or a signature-signing machine — to sign certain documents for decades, and then-President George W. Bush\\'s Justice Department said in 2005 that the president can legally use an autopen to sign bills into law. Mr. Trump said in March he has occasionally used an autopen, but \"only for very unimportant papers.\"\\nBut Mr. Trump and his allies have suggested Biden\\'s alleged use of an autopen could be illegitimate. In March, the president claimed a slate of pardons issued to some Trump foes in the final days of his administration were \"VOID\" and \"VACANT.\"CBS News legal contributor Jessica Levinson said in March that Mr. Trump cannot revoke his predecessor\\'s pardons, even if an autopen was involved, noting that the president\\'s constitutional power to pardon people is extremely broad. \"This is not a gray area,\" she said on \"CBS Mornings Plus.\"Early Wednesday, Mr. Trump on Truth Social\\xa0called the alleged autopen use \"THE BIGGEST POLITICAL SCANDAL IN AMERICAN HISTORY,\" aside from the 2020 presidential election, which Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed — without evidence — was rigged.Scrutiny over Biden\\'s mental acuity while in office has ramped up in recent weeks, amid new reporting about the circumstances of Biden\\'s exit from the 2024 presidential race.

The goal was to make a Galaxy S25 Plus that’s easier to hold, but Samsung did not set out to make the thinnest phone possible – in fact the Galaxy S25 Edge isn’t even the thinnest phone Samsung makes today. Instead, it did what Samsung does best: it gave us a little more inside a little less.The Galaxy S25 Edge is a very good phone, and it feels like something unique compared to every other phone I’ve reviewed. The difference is noticeable; it’s much slimmer and lighter than almost everything else, even when wearing a case. Still, the S25 Edge isn’t a revolutionary new design, and I can’t help but anticipate the competition it’s going to face from Apple in the shape of the rumored iPhone 17 Air.This is the thinnest Galaxy S device Samsung has ever crafted. It’s 1.5mm thinner than the Galaxy S25 Plus, and almost 2.5mm thinner than the Galaxy S25 UItra.Could I feel that millimeter in my hand? I’m not sure, but between the thinness and the weight reduction – it’s almost a full ounce lighter than the Plus and two ounces lighter than the Ultra – the Galaxy S25 Edge is undoubtedly a standout.Front to back: Galaxy S25 Edge, Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, Galaxy S25 Ultra (Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)The Galaxy S25 Edge isn’t the phone for you if you want the thinnest phone possible. It’s the phone for you if you want a Galaxy S25 Plus, but wish it were easier to hold. It’s the Galaxy S25 Ultra, minus the extra bits that you wouldn’t use, like the S Pen stylus. It’s not something totally new, but it’s a better option for the right buyer.But why didn’t Samsung go for broke? Why not make the Edge the absolute thinnest smartphone ever? The Galaxy Z Fold 6 is 5.6mm thin when it’s unfolded. Had it shaved another 0.3mm off the Edge, Samsung could have at least said that this is the thinnest Samsung phone you can buy.The answer, of course, is battery life. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 is super thin, but the battery is split between the two halves. Each half of the Z Fold 6 packs only about 2,200mAh of battery life (for 4,400mAh total), which is a lot less than the 3,800mAh the Galaxy S25 Edge offers.A thinner Galaxy S25 Edge would have meant a smaller battery, and based on my testing, the S25 Edge is using the smallest battery it can get away with.The Edge had trouble lasting past dinner time in my testing period. If Samsung had made the Edge the thinnest phone ever!, it probably wouldn’t last through my lunch break. I have no doubt Samsung could build such a phone, but I wouldn’t recommend it.That makes the S25 Edge a pleasantly thin phone that is simply not very special. There are no special features that set it apart from the rest of the Galaxy S25 family. There’s nothing new here. It’s a well-crafted device that delivers exactly what I expected; no more and no less. That’s not a bad thing! It’s just… predictable.Front to back: Galaxy S25 Edge, iPhone 16 Pro Max, Galaxy S25 Ultra (Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)The big problem is that Samsung is competing against a specter. The iPhone 17 Air could arrive later this year, and it’s hard not to see the Galaxy S25 Edge as a preemptive attack by Samsung on Apple’s next design concept. Because make no mistake, Apple is going to make a big deal out of going thin.Apple is going to pretend it invented the millimeter. If and when Apple launches an iPhone Air in September, it will act like thinness is the biggest design innovation since the capacitive touchscreen. All other specs be damned! And I think Apple will be willing to shrink the battery and cut back on cameras even more severely than Samsung.If that happens, the iPhone 17 Air will probably be less capable than the Galaxy S25 Edge in many ways, but it will give Apple the all-important bragging rights. Apple could use the dual-OLED display found on the iPad Pro, and recent rumors suggest the rumored phone will be around 5.5mm, making it thinner than any phone Samsung currently sells.In a way, this takes the pressure off Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Edge is a very nice phone, and it fits neatly into Samsung’s price ladder as a little nicer than the Galaxy S25 Plus, but not as feature-packed as the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It doesn’t need to prove anything – the Galaxy S25 Edge does fine with less, without trying to be the most.Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge review: Price and availabilityStarts at $1,099 / £1,099 / AU$1,849 for 256GB/12GB configurationThat’s $100 / £100 / AU$500 more than S25 Plus, $200 / £150 less than the UltraLeft to right: Galaxy S25 Ultra, Galaxy S25 Edge, Galaxy S25 Plus, Galaxy S25 (Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)The Galaxy S25 Edge slots in neatly between the Galaxy S25 Plus and S25 Ultra in Samsung’s lineup. It’s closer to the Plus, which makes sense because it lacks more of the Ultra features than it possesses – there’s no S Pen, no telescopic zoom lens, and no big battery inside, for instance, although it is, like the S25 Ultra, built from titanium.Otherwise, you get most of what you’d expect from the Galaxy S25 Plus, minus the zoom camera. It packs a sensor with a lot of megapixels, and that sensor is actually larger than the main sensor on the Galaxy S25 Plus. Both cameras use sensors that are smaller than the main 200MP sensor on the mighty Galaxy S25 Ultra.Now I need a moment with my Australian friends, because something very odd is happening down under. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has come down in price by AU$400 since launch, which means it costs less than the Galaxy S25 Edge by AU$100. Also, the S25 Edge seems priced a bit high in Australia compared to the rest of the world – it’s AU$500 more than the Galaxy S25 Plus?! That seems like a mistake, but it’s the real price for now, so I would wait until Samsung offers a discount to buy the Edge.Swipe to scroll horizontallyStorageUS priceUK priceAU price256GB$1,099£1,099AU$1,849512GB$1,219£1,199AU$2,049Value score: 4 / 5Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge review: SpecsSamsung Galaxy S25 Edge (left) and Galaxy S25 Plus (right) are very similar inside (Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)Like the rest of the Galaxy S25 family, the S25 Edge gets 12GB of RAM to support the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset inside. This platform has proven powerful and very efficient in my reviews of the best Android phones this year.The 6.7-inch display on the S25 Edge seems to be identical to that on the S25 Plus. The main camera uses a new 200MP sensor that we haven’t seen before, which is a bit smaller than the 200MP sensor on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but larger than the 50MP sensor on the Galaxy S25 Plus. There’s no telephoto lens, but the Edge seems to use the same 12MP ultrawide camera as the S25 Plus.The Galaxy S25 Edge comes with a 3,900mAh battery under its display, which is even smaller than the 4,000mAh battery beneath the Galaxy S25’s 6.2-inch screen.

Photos don’t do justice to the remarkably light weight, and that’s a big part of the experience.If you get pinky-finger fatigue from balancing your phone, the S25 Edge might be the phone that will save your favorite digit. Even though it has a huge 6.7-inch display, the Galaxy S25 Edge is lighter than the iPhone 16 (6.1-inch screen, 170g), or the Pixel 9 (6.3-inch screen, 198g). It’s only one gram heavier than the 6.2-inch Galaxy S25, but it feels lighter since it’s less dense.I almost always use a case with my phone, and since Samsung did not have cases ready for my review period, I asked my friends at Casetify to send over their thinnest cases for the Galaxy S25 Edge. Even with a case on the phone, it still feels remarkably thin and light, especially considering that huge screen size. My S25 Edge in a protective Casetify shell is still lighter than my Galaxy S25 Ultra with no case.Image 1 of 3The Galaxy S25 Ultra is almost as thick as the Galaxy S25 Edge in a case, including the camera bump(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)The design overall looks nearly identical to that of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but on very close inspection things are less impressive. Frankly, the build quality of the Galaxy S25 Edge seems messy compared to the Ultra or to any Apple iPhone.There are gaps between the frame and the back glass. The SIM card tray doesn’t line up perfectly. There’s a gap between the camera bump and the back of the phone that I worried would pick up dirt – and by the end of my review period, that was the dingiest part of the phone.(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)This phone could have been special. Samsung could have tried something new, like capacitive buttons on the side – a trick that rumors say Apple is considering. It could have had super-fast charging to go with that slim battery. It could have had unique colors or a unique finish.Instead, it’s just a slimmer version of a phone we got six months ago, and it’s not even a really nice version at that.Design score: 3 / 5Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge review: DisplayMore Galaxy S25 Plus than Ultra, but that’s pretty greatFingerprint scanner was totally unreliable(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)The Galaxy S25 Edge, like the Galaxy S25 Plus, is sort of a hidden gem in Samsung’s lineup when it comes to display quality. While the S25 Ultra has a slightly-larger 6.9-inch screen, all three phones all have the same resolution. When you pack the same pixels into a smaller display, you get a screen that’s technically sharper, in terms of pixel density.Which is to say the Galaxy S25 Edge has a fantastic screen, one of the best you can find on any phone. It is plenty bright, even in bright sunlight, though the Ultra does beat the Edge thanks to the addition of the remarkable coating that Samsung has been using for a couple of years to eliminate glare on its flagship flat phone.The display can refresh at up to 120Hz – take that iPhone 16 Plus – and thanks to LTPO tech you can even get a full-color always-on display that refreshes as slowly as 1Hz to save power.I’ve never had great luck with Samsung’s fingerprint scanners, and the S25 Edge didn’t recognize me any faster than other Galaxy phones, and unlocking failed more often than not. I know I have fingerprints because my OnePlus 13 sees them with 99% accuracy, so I assume this is a Samsung problem, not a me problem.Display score: 5 / 5Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge review: SoftwareOneUI 7 is well built, but doesn’t add much to the Edge experienceAI features can be useful, but many feel like even more bloat(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)For better and for worse, the Galaxy S25 Edge uses the same One UI 7 interface as the rest of the Galaxy S25 family, with Android 15 serving as the engine. Samsung and Google seem to be locked in a perpetual struggle to control Samsung’s phones, so you’ll get two web browsers, two photo gallery apps, even two wallets and two different password managers.It’s getting to be a bit much. I’m the first to insist that Samsung’s software – like its Internet web browser – performs better than Google’s alternative. But nobody wants two of everything; you don’t get an extra steering wheel when you buy a car. It’s time for Samsung to end the duplicate-apps project.(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)There are plenty of Galaxy AI features on the phone, and it comes with Google Gemini preloaded and ready to take over the power button at your beck and call.I think we may have already hit the wall with AI features. Samsung has been touting its Now Brief widget and app since the Galaxy S25 launched, and it’s a completely useless piece of software. It’s supposed to learn things about me and then offer information tailored to my needs, but nothing like that happens.I’ve been wearing a Galaxy Watch Ultra and Galaxy Buds 3 Pro while using the S25 Edge for weeks. The Now Brief offers no more than today’s weather, a missive that feels creepy coming from an AI (‘Wishing you well’?!), and the first few events on my work calendar, which are usually the first three people who took the day off and logged it properly.(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)At worst, Now Brief offers me partisan political news. I filter out most politics from my social feeds, and I don’t talk about politics in my text messages, so I’m not sure why Now Brief thinks politics are what interests me. It’s inescapable.Thankfully, Samsung has confirmed that the Galaxy S25 Edge will get seven years of major Android and security updates, so it should last through Android 22, just like the rest of the Galaxy S25 family.Software score: 3 / 5Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge review: CamerasExactly what I expected based on the specsSamsung’s processing can be fun, or inconsistent(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)When I heard that the Galaxy S25 Edge would use fewer cameras than its S25 stablemates, with one big 200MP main sensor and a supporting ultra-wide, I was excited at the prospect. After all, one of Leica’s most popular cameras, the Leica Q3, uses a single large sensor and a wide lens, and fakes all of the zoom with digital cropping. If anybody can pull off the same trick on a camera phone, it’s Samsung.Nope. I’m disappointed to say the cameras are fine, but not groundbreaking. I was hoping the Edge would be a trendsetter. Instead, it runs down the middle of the road without faltering. It does a great job at the things Samsung camera phones do well, but it can’t handle the all-in-one duties of the Galaxy S25 Ultra.There are no surprises with the Galaxy S25 Edge cameras. The main camera uses a 200MP sensor with a wide lens, and that sensor is a bit smaller than the 200MP sensor on the Galaxy S25 Ultra. No surprise then that the Ultra is still the best Samsung camera phone, in more ways than one.(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)The main camera produces images that are a bit fuzzier than what I got from the Galaxy S25 Ultra, and I was surprised to find the colors dialed back a bit as well. The Edge’s cameras don’t seem to be tuned to pop colors as much as the Ultra cameras do. It still managed to take excellent food photos and warm portraits, like I expect from Samsung.Image 1 of 2Taken with Galaxy S25 Edge(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)Galaxy S25 Edge 100% cropIf you need a zoom lens, the S25 Edge isn’t going to satisfy you. The digital zoom doesn’t come close to providing the detail and quality I get with optical zoom on the Galaxy S25 Ultra and iPhone 16 Pro Max. A heron across the river looked like a white, featherless blob when I snapped a pic with the Edge. The iPhone and Galaxy Ultra images revealed a beak and some plumage.Image 1 of 2Taken with the Galaxy S25 Edge(Image credit: Philip BerneFuture)Galaxy S25 Edge 10X digital zoomIf you take a lot of photos outdoors, the S25 Ultra has a coating on the display to reduce glare, and it makes a big difference even compared to the S25 Edge, which has a nearly-identical display otherwise. The Edge can get bright, but it’s much easier to see the Ultra’s screen if the sun is shining directly on you.Camera score: 3 / 5Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge review: Camera samplesImage 1 of 7(Image credit: Philip BerneFuture)Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge review: PerformanceExcellent performance from the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 EliteThe Edge stayed very cool under conditions that break other phones (Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)I was expecting excellent performance from the Galaxy S25 Edge, and this phone delivered beyond my expectations. It was plenty fast, with that overclocked Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset providing a bit more boost than you’ll get on a non-Samsung Snapdragon phone. Samsung has also done a remarkable job of keeping the phone cool, even when you push the performance to the limit.I perform a stress test where I run multiple mapping apps on a phone, and play music over Bluetooth, then sit the phone above my car dashboard in the sunshine. Most phones take less than an hour of this punishment before they shut down due to overheating.The S25 Edge never quit, managing to stay cool enough to function for as long as I needed. That’s incredible – every iPhone, Pixel phone, and Galaxy phone I’ve tested has failed this endurance test. The Edge really lives up to Samsung’s claims of much better cooling – that 10% larger vapor chamber clearly makes a real difference.This makes the Galaxy S25 Edge an easy contender for a best gaming phone ranking. It offers great performance and superior cooling – everything a gaming phone needs.I also had fun playing games with the Galaxy S25 Edge clipped onto my Xbox wireless controller using a cheap third-party attachment from Amazon. The phone is so lightweight that gaming for long periods was a breeze – it’s a nice way to kill time while I wait for my Switch 2 to arrive.Performance score: 5 / 5Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge review: Battery Good battery for the thin size, but not greatCouldn’t last a full day if I used it aggressively (Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)As I said above, Samsung could have made a thinner Galaxy S25 Edge, but the battery life would be terrible – as it is, during my review period the S25 Edge often needed a recharge while I was eating dinner, especially if I played games, took a lot of photos, or otherwise taxed the phone heavily.If I scrolled my social feeds and listened to music on the train into work, I would be concerned about whether the battery would last until the train ride home.It’s too bad Samsung didn’t use the latest silicon carbon battery technology found in the OnePlus 13, which might have helped it to pack in more power. I also wish this phone charged faster than other Galaxy S25 models, not slower – if it had 80W charging like the latest OnePlus phones I wouldn’t be worried about having to top up throughout the day, because that top-up would take less than 15 minutes.(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)As it stands, 15 minutes of charging got me just past 25%, and a full charge took about an hour. That’s pretty slow by today’s standards, especially considering that this battery is smaller than any other inside a Galaxy S25 phone.Samsung might also be exaggerating its battery claims. It told us to expect the Edge to offer longevity somewhere between the Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S25, but in our lab benchmark tests the S25 Edge lasted for less than 13 hours of constant use where the Galaxy S24 lasted more than 13 hours, and the Galaxy S25 topped 15 hours.If you really need good battery life the Galaxy S25 Plus is the Samsung champ, delivering almost 19 hours of screen time in our rundown test. But it’s not the Edge’s lack of battery life as such that bugs me; it’s how long it takes to top the phone up.Battery score: 3 / 5Swipe to scroll horizontallySamsung Galaxy S25 Edge score cardValueNot a bad price for the svelte design and pocketability. You know what you’re getting, there are no surprises, so it seems like a fair upgrade from the Galaxy S25 Plus (or is it a downgrade from the Ultra?)4/5DesignA bit thinner and much lighter than any other flat phone you’ve tried. You can’t tell by looking; you have to pick it up to feel the difference. The finish is a bit shoddy, but the design might still satisfy buyers with a sore pinky.3/5DisplayThe same great display I saw on the Galaxy S25 Plus (with the same lousy fingerprint scanner). It’s super sharp and very bright, though if you’ll often be in bright sunshine the Ultra has a better anti-glare coating that makes it worth a look. 5/5SoftwareSamsung’s One UI looks as good as ever, though the AI features are starting to wane in terms of their usefulness. Thankfully, this phone gets seven years of updates, so it will have no problem running your favorite apps and hopefully improving in the years to come. 3/5CamerasYou get fewer cameras on a thinner phone, but the main camera still takes fantastic shots, albeit ones that are a bit subdued by normal Samsung standards. They don’t pack the same detail as the Ultra, but food photos and portraits are especially gorgeous. 3/5PerformanceFantastic performance from the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with some of the most impressive cooling I’ve experienced on a smartphone. I couldn’t get the Edge to fry itself, no matter how much I pushed past its performance limits. 5/5BatteryBattery life isn’t terrible considering the weight reduction, but I wish the smaller battery came with faster charging to make me forget how long I need to wait. I had to charge the phone most nights after dinner, unless I was careful. 3/5Buy it if...Don't buy it if...Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge review: Also considerSwipe to scroll horizontallyHeader Cell - Column 0 Samsung Galaxy S25 EdgeSamsung Galaxy S25 PlusGalaxy S25 UltraPrice:$1,099 / £1,099 / AU$1,849$999 / £999 / AU$1,699$1,299 / £1,249 / AU$2,149Display:6.7-inch LTPO AMOLED6.7-inch LTPO AMOLED6.9-inch LTPO AMOLEDCameras:200MP main, 12MP ultra-wide50MP main, 12MP ultra-wide, 10MP 3x telephoto200MP main, 50MP ultra-wide, 10MP 3x telephoto, 50MP 5x telephotoBattery Life HH:MM (Future Labs test):12:4518:4618:35How I tested the Samsung Galaxy S25 EdgeI tested the phone for two weeksI took dozens of photosI played games and watched moviesI checked email and worked in SlackI used AI features extensivelyBenchmark testing is for comparison, not scoring purposesI tested the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge for more than two weeks before posting this review. I received the Edge before I traveled to Google I/O, and I took the phone along as my primary work device and for entertainment on flights.When I got back from Google I/O I had Covid, so the Galaxy S25 Edge was my primary couch companion, and my source of entertainment and contact with the world. I used it to play games, watch movies, and listen to audiobooks.When I’d recovered, I took the S25 Edge car shopping and connected it to a number of different cars to test. I used the phone to take photos, research cars, and more. I even asked for help from Google Gemini and Samsung’s Galaxy AI to do research, answer calls, and respond to solicitors.I connected the Galaxy S25 Edge to a Galaxy Watch Ultra, Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, and an Xbox Wireless controller, among numerous other devices.Future Labs tests phones using a mix of third-party benchmark software and proprietary, real-world tests.

The Treasury is said to be looking at linking the payments to people\\'s incomes instead of pension credit.\\u200cMinisters would do this by initially giving back the up to £300 payments as a universal benefit to 10 million pensioners, according to multiple reports. They would then recoup the money from about five million OAPs through higher tax bills over the next financial year.READ MORE: Winter fuel payments WILL be available to more pensioners this year says Rachel ReevesChancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to set out the details of the Government\\'s winter fuel payments U-turn next week (Image: Jason Roberts /Manchester Evening News)Jonathan Athow, a senior director at HMRC, yesterday highlighted how a similar system works for child benefit. “What we have done with the child benefit charge shows there is a flexibility in the tax system that shows it does not require self-assessment,” he told MPs.Article continues belowBut the Guardian raised concerns that some bereaved families could face requests for their dead relatives to return winter fuel payments. This is because there could be a six-month gap between pensioners receiving the initial payment and then some being asked to return it when they fill in their tax returns, the newspaper said. There are fears thousands of pensioners could have died in that time.Asked about the reports, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson today refused to be drawn on the details. She said: \"I can\\'t comment on speculation. It\\'s not for me to make announcements around precise mechanisms as to how this will be delivered, but what I can say is that we do want more pensioners to receive the winter fuel allowance and the Chancellor (and) the Prime Minister will set out how that will happen. \"She added that she did not think \"multi-millionaires\" should get the winter fuel allowance.\\u200cMs Reeves yesterday said pensioners will get the winter fuel allowance this year. Pressed by the Mirror on winter fuel payment eligibility at an event in Rochdale, the Chancellor said: “We have listened to the concerns people had about the level of the means test.“So we will be making changes to that. They will be in place so that pensioners will be paid for this coming winter.\" It comes after pensioners were left in the dark on how many people would be eligible - and when the changes would come into effect.\\u200cThe Government announced cuts to the winter fuel payments not long after the election last year. They faced a huge backlash after stopping the support being paid universally and instead changing to a means-tested system.Pensions Minister Torsten Bell yesterday ruled out returning to universal winter fuel payments. He confirmed the Government will not be returning to a system in which millionaires receive the benefit.He told MPs: \"On your question of is there any prospect of a universal winter fuel payment, the answer is no, the principle I think most people, 95% of people, agree, that it\\'s not a good idea that we have a system paying a few hundreds of pounds to millionaires, and so we\\'re not going to be continuing with that.

You know, I do have that unscientific system that I use — my email traffic — and my distinct impression is that using ABS in spring training has made people more prone to complain about balls and strike calls via email, to me, referencing the need for ABS. That is undoubtedly true, undoubtedly true.\"The system was a full-go in spring training this year after several seasons in the minor leagues. Teams got two challenges per game but were able to retain each challenge won. Only the batter, pitcher or catcher could challenge a call, and it had to be immediately after the call with no help from the bench or other players.But there are still some kinks that need fine-tuning.\"My single biggest concern is working through the process and deploying it in a way that’s acceptable to the players,\" Manfred said. \"There’s always going to be things around the edges that we need to work through and whatever, and I want them to feel like we respected the committee process and that there was a full airing of concerns about the system, and an attempt to address those concerns before we go forward.\"It is yet another big change to the sport commissioned by Manfred, who implemented a pitch timer, larger bases and shift limits in 2023. However, fans seem to like the changes as attendance has increased in each of the last two years. It was the first time since 2011 and 2012 that attendance grew in back-to-back seasons.

Everybody understood what the rules of the road are. … Unlike the prior provision, there’s actually a process that is involved that you go through that you kind of have a chance to vet and talk about what should happen with the players. So I’m less reticent about that.This, however, would arguably be the biggest change of them all, and it would come at quite wild timing: a lockout is looming at MLB\\'s collective bargaining agreement ends in December of next year.

(ispace, inc. via AP)APA private lunar lander from Japan is closing in on the moon, aiming for a touchdown in the unexplored far north with a mini rover.The moon landing attempt by Tokyo-based company ispace on Friday Japan time is the latest entry in the rapidly expanding commercial lunar rush.Article continues below this adThe encore comes two years after the company’s first moonshot ended in a crash landing, giving rise to the name Resilience for its successor lander. Resilience holds a rover with a shovel to gather lunar dirt as well as a Swedish artist’s toy-size red house that will be lowered onto the moon’s dusty surface.Long the province of governments, the moon became a target of private outfits in 2019, with more flops than wins along the way.Launched in January from Florida on a long, roundabout journey, Resilience entered lunar orbit last month. It shared a SpaceX ride with Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost, which reached the moon faster and became the first private entity to successfully land there in March.Another U.S. company, Intuitive Machines, arrived at the moon a few days after Firefly. But the tall, spindly lander face-planted in a crater near the moon’s south pole and was declared dead within hours.Article continues below this adResilience is targeting the top of the moon, a less forbidding place than the shadowy bottom. The ispace team chose a flat area with few boulders in Mare Frigoris or Sea of Cold, a long and narrow region full of craters and ancient lava flows that stretches across the near side’s northern tier.Once settled with power and communication flowing, the 7.5-foot (2.3-meter) Resilience will lower the piggybacking rover onto the lunar surface.Made of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic with four wheels, ispace’s European-built rover — named Tenacious — sports a high-definition camera to scout out the area and a shovel to scoop up some lunar dirt for NASA.The rover, weighing just 11 pounds (5 kilograms), will stick close to the lander, going in circles at a speed of less than one inch (a couple centimeters) per second.Article continues below this adBesides science and tech experiments, there’s an artistic touch.The rover holds a tiny, Swedish-style red cottage with white trim and a green door, dubbed the Moonhouse by creator Mikael Genberg, for placement on the lunar surface.Takeshi Hakamada, CEO and founder of ispace, considers the latest moonshot “merely a steppingstone,” with its next, much bigger lander launching by 2027 with NASA involvement, and even more to follow.“We’re not trying to corner the market. We’re trying to build the market,” Jeremy Fix, chief engineer for ispace\\'s U.S. subsidiary, said at a conference last month. “It’s a huge market, a huge potential.\"Article continues below this adFix noted that ispace, like other businesses, does not have “infinite funds” and cannot afford repeated failures. While not divulging the cost of the current mission, company officials said it’s less than the first one which exceeded $100 million.Two other U.S. companies are aiming for moon landings by year’s end: Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin and Astrobotic Technology. Astrobotic’s first lunar lander missed the moon altogether in 2024 and came crashing back through Earth’s atmosphere.For decades, governments competed to get to the moon. Only five countries have pulled off successful robotic lunar landings: Russia, the U.S., China, India and Japan. Of those, only the U.S. has landed people on the moon: 12 NASA astronauts from 1969 through 1972.NASA expects to send four astronauts around the moon next year. That would be followed a year or more later by the first lunar landing by a crew in more than a half-century, with SpaceX\\'s Starship providing the lift from lunar orbit all the way down to the surface. China also has moon landing plans for its own astronauts by 2030.Article continues below this ad___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

PUBLISHED: 07:01, Thu, Jun 5, 2025 Ellie Boyle is reducing her mortgage term thanks to the Sprive app (Image: Ellie Boyle)A homeowner has spoken about how she is using a shopping rewards app to help reduce her mortgage term by 10 years.Ellie Boyle, 36, from Solihull, hopes to be mortgage-free by the time she turns 40, and uses the Sprive app to get cashback rewards on her weekly shopping.She and her husband Colin are overpaying towards their mortgage anyway, and she gets about 50p in rewards for each transaction through the Sprive app, with the family paying around £40 or £50 a month towards their mortgage thanks to the app.The Sprive app allows users to get cashback rewards when making purchases at a range of retailers and shop chains, and the amount can then be used towards paying off your mortgage.The couple are making regular overpayments of around £2,000 a month to bring down their mortgage term. Ellie uses the app on her shopping at Tesco and Morrisons while her husband also gets the rewards for his Uber rides twice a day to get to and from work.They have been using the app for about 18 months. Ellie said of using Sprive: \"It is nice and easy. All the accounts are all connected, even when buying any of the giftcards through Sprive, all the bank accounts are connected so it\\'s a fairly straightforward process once it\\'s set up.\"They are especially keen to pay off their mortgage over the next few years as Colin has retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative condition that affects his eyesight.He works as a maths teacher but is registered blind and will likely have to give up work over the next few years.Ellie said: \"That\\'s the main driver for wanting to pay off the mortgage, it\\'s so we don\\'t have an additional bill round our heads when that time does come.\"Then we\\'ve got a little bit more freedom and flexibility, the only thing we need to support are the bills then and any other outgoings.\"Ellie and Colin bought their first home in 2013 with a £145,000 mortgage. They moved in 2018 and increased their mortgage to £202,000, later adding a £35,000 loan for a loft conversion.

She said each teacher has about 10 students. Schools nationally, by contrast, have an average of 15 students per instructor.\"We know every one of our kids on a very personal basis,\" Fairhead said. \"I know when they walk through the door if something\\'s off, and I need to check in with them.\"\\nOnward Learning is part of the growing \"microschool\" movement in the US. These schools have fewer than 20 students total on average and tend to employ an alternative learning environment that focuses on personalized lessons for each student. Demand for them is growing due to parents\\' desires to have a greater say in their kids\\' educations and have more options beyond the public schools in their district.Their popularity comes as the Trump administration is seeking to expand school voucher programs and has proposed redirecting federal funds from public schools to private schools, which could boost microschools\\' resources.Critics worry that the category is poorly defined — it could encompass a homeschool or a group facilitated by a teacher in a church, allowing for minimal state and federal regulation. Microschool advocates said kids learn best when education is tailored to best suit their needs.\\n\"It\\'s my opinion that this type of learning could be beneficial for any child, but especially those kids that just need a little more space, either space to learn, space to run, and just a little less pressure,\" Fairhead said. \"If you\\'re the type of parent who wants a very structured day, lots of testing, and all of that, then my type of school is probably not the right fit.\"\\'A new version of a one-room schoolhouse\\'Given the lack of definition, it\\'s difficult to predict the number of students enrolled in a microschool at any given time. The RAND Corporation, a nonpartisan research organization, said in a March report that \"the best currently available estimate\" for the number of kids enrolled in a microschool full-time is between 1 million and 2 million, with \"many more\" enrolled part-time. Some microschools partner with religious institutions for funding and other resources.Fairhead said that her school enrolled 12 kids in its first year, and she just finished the third school year with 37 students from kindergarten through 8th grade and a \"pretty long\" waitlist. The days are typically structured with a few hours of learning core subjects in the morning, like science and math, and the rest of the day is focused on \"experiential learning,\" like art, music, and outdoor activities.She also incorporates Lakota language — the indigenous language of the reservation near the school — into the students\\' curriculum.\"If a child\\'s struggling and they need something more personalized, we find it for them,\" Fairhead said. \"Or if they\\'re excelling and they need something that\\'s going to challenge them more, we find that for them.\"\\nFairhead\\'s microschool dedicates part of the school day to experiential learning.\\nCourtesy of Mary Jo Fairhead\\nInterest in microschools started to grow during the pandemic as families looked for ways to keep students together while schools were closed, Paige Shoemaker DeMio, a senior analyst for K-12 education policy at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, told BI. She called it \"a new version of a one-room schoolhouse.\"The National Microschooling Center — a nonprofit that works to advance the microschool movement — released an analysis of the sector in May. Using data from interviews and online questionnaires with 800 microschools across all 50 states and the District of Columbia, the analysis said that 74% of microschools have annual tuition and fees at or below $10,000. It also said that 41% of microschools rely on state-provided school choice funds to operate.Fairhead said that she partners with the local tribe for funding. She also received a $200,000 grant as a semifinalist of the Yass Prize, founded by billionaire Jeff Yass to award high-impact education initiatives.\\nFairhead\\'s microschool enrolled 37 students in the most recent school year.\\nCourtesy of Mary Jo Fairhead\\nDon Soifer, CEO of the National Microschooling Center, told BI that the majority of microschool founders and teachers also have certified teaching experience.\"Microschool leaders come from a background as experienced educators themselves who are excited at the opportunity for professional growth in no longer being bound by the requirements of the rigidities of a public school system,\" Soifer said.Soifer added that the goal of microschools is not to replace the public school system. Rather, it\\'s to give families another option where their kids can be in a much smaller setting, and parents can be more clued into what their child is doing on a day-to-day basis.\"We all have friends who are working in the public schools, making important progress on improving them, and more power to them for having the patience to do that,\" Soifer said, adding that he spent years doing the same. \"But there are families that can\\'t wait 20 years, 25 years for the public schools to make the improvements that are going to be able to help our kids who are in school right now.\"Different regulations from state to stateRegulations for microschools vary by state.\\xa0An analysis by the\\xa0National Microschooling Center\\xa0found that\\xa0over half of microschools follow their state\\'s homeschooling requirements, while the rest either follow their state\\'s nonpublic school guidelines or operate in a state with a defined microschool statute.\\nWest Virginia, for example, codified the legal definition of a microschool in 2022, which says that one or more teachers can create a school that charges tuition and is an alternative to public, private, and homeschool enrollment. Georgia codified the legal definition of a learning pod one year prior, which could include a microschool structure.Having those legal definitions allows regulators to ensure microschools are meeting the necessary requirements, Shoemaker DeMio said — and the lack of definitions from other states raises concerns on how to best hold those schools accountable. Lack of accountability could give rise to misuse of funds and inability to track whether kids are effectively learning the curriculum, she said.\"If we have a way that we can categorize certain schools as microschools, then we\\'re able to actually break down the data and we\\'re able to better understand who these students are serving and what quality of education they\\'re receiving or how they\\'re achieving,\" she said.Some microschools have been investigated for accusations of misusing funds. Arizona\\'s attorney general\\xa0launched\\xa0an investigation in 2021 into a microschool company, accusing it of collecting charter school funding from the state without actually providing any curriculum. In West Virginia, the state\\'s treasurer\\xa0included\\xa0a microschool in an investigation following complaints from parents that their tuition was not being used to teach their children.Fairhead said that she doesn\\'t think more regulations are necessary and that they could diminish teachers\\' passion. She said that parents hold her accountable: \"They ask questions. They want to know what we\\'re teaching and what our kids are learning. And I prefer them to be my accountability over somebody who doesn\\'t know my kids, doesn\\'t know our area, and doesn\\'t know me.\"Shoemaker DeMio said that absent clear guidelines, data on microschools and student outcomes will remain minimal.\"If we can get specific regulations and guidance at the state level, that would be really helpful. It can provide us with data so that we could better track the schools,\" she said. \"But at the same time, it would also be helpful for people interested in starting microschools if they have a better understanding, if they have better guidance from the state on how to go about this.\"Do you have experience with microschooling or alternative forms of education?

Today, Iran is talking to America about a possible diplomatic deal over its nuclear program and the idea of ties between the West and the outside world again seems possible, though difficult. The thing about taking pictures and working as a photojournalist in Tehran, my hometown, is that Iranians will come up to you in the street and tell you what they think. And sometimes, even when they won\\'t say something out loud, I\\'ll see it in the images I capture. That’s particularly true with the gradual change we have seen in how women dress, whether in ancient corridors of Tehran’s Grand Bazaar or in the tony streets of northern Tehran. Women are forgoing the mandatory hijab, or headscarf, even as hard-liners try to pressure a renewed enforcement of the law against what they call the \"Western Cultural Invasion.”The government of reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian has meanwhile been urging restraint by police and others over the hijab. There are enough problems right now in Iran is their thought, particularly as Iran’s economy remains in dire straits. U.S. sanctions have decimated it. Iran’s rial currency has plummeted in recent years. That economic hardship has made people more distrustful of the country’s theocracy. And so people continue their daily lives in Tehran as they wait for any news after five rounds of talks so far between Iran and the U.S. You can see it in my photos. A carpet-seller waits to sell his wares in a darkened bazaar corner. Women without hijabs smoke shisha, or water-pipe tobacco. Another woman, wearing an all-black, all-encompassing chador, prays in a mosque’s courtyard. It can all appear contradictory, but that’s life here. Tehran, home to some 10 million people, is the ever-growing beating heart of Iran. And as it awaits the results of the negotiations, it can feel like it is skipping beats in anticipation. ___See more AP photography at https://apnews.com/photography', 'location': 'IRN', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Life in Tehran during US-Iran nuclear talks\\nENTITIES: Iran, US, Tehran, Revolutionary Guard, Masoud Pezeshkian\\nEVENT: Life in Tehran continues amid high-stakes nuclear negotiations between Iran and the US, with visible social changes like women forgoing hijabs despite hard-line pressure.\\nCONTEXT: Economic hardship and social changes occur during nuclear talks.', 'createdAt': '2025-06-05T08:04:47.658Z'}, {'id': 106123, 'sourceId': 12662, 'url': 'https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/agroterrorism-alert-us-calls-out-researchers-biothreat-smuggling-1734968', 'title': 'Agroterrorism Alert: US Calls Out Researchers of Biothreat Smuggling', 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T07:10:25.000Z', 'content': \"The US Department of Justice has accused two Chinese researchers of smuggling a hazardous biological agent into the country, reigniting concerns over agroterrorism and the potential consequences for global food security and biosecurity protocols.How a Crop-Killing Fungus Was Illegally ImportedAccording to US authorities, Zunyong Liu unlawfully transported Fusarium graminearum, a crop-destroying fungus into the United States during a visit to the University of Michigan in 2023. Liu allegedly delivered the sample to fellow researcher Yunqing Jian, who worked at the university.Both men are now facing federal charges, including conspiracy to smuggle biological material and violation of agricultural import restrictions.Why Fusarium graminearum is a Major Threat to Global AgricultureOften overlooked by the public, Fusarium graminearum causes a disease known as 'head blight'. This infection damages wheat and barley crops, reducing yields by up to 50%. The fungus also produces mycotoxins, which can be harmful to both humans and animals if ingested through contaminated food.Officials warn that the organism could be weaponised in acts of agroterrorism to destabilise national economies or food supplies.The UK's Food Chain Could Be at RiskAlthough this case is centred in the United States, the implications are global. The United Kingdom imports nearly 45% of its food. An intentional or accidental outbreak could severely impact British agriculture and supply chains.'It would only take one deliberate release to trigger widespread economic disruption,' said Dr Karen Mitchell, a plant pathology lecturer at a London-based agricultural college.Why Research Institutions Must Tighten Biosecurity MeasuresJian's arrest has raised questions about academic responsibility and oversight. Although he claimed the material was for research purposes, the unauthorised nature of the import breaches strict US agricultural protocols.Calls are growing for universities to review their handling of high-risk agents and implement stronger biosecurity procedures in laboratory environments.Biothreat Smuggling Is On the RiseCross-border transfers of biological materials are becoming increasingly common, especially in global research collaborations. This trend has made detection and enforcement more challenging for authorities around the world.Experts argue that greater international cooperation is essential to prevent future cases of biothreat smuggling, particularly where food systems and public health are at stake.Strengthening Defence Against AgroterrorismTo combat these risks, specialists recommend:More stringent customs checks on biological samplesEnhanced training for researchers on ethical handlingInstitutional review boards for pathogen-based researchCloser tracking of cross-border transfers of agricultural agentsLooking Ahead: Protecting the Global Food SupplyThe Liu and Jian case is a stark reminder that food security is an urgent global issue not just for nations like the United States, but also for the United Kingdom.With nearly half of its food imported, the UK is especially vulnerable to disruptions caused by biological threats.A deliberate or accidental release of a crop pathogen could lead to severe losses, soaring prices, and increased dependence on foreign markets.As the investigation continues, British authorities must reassess whether current biosecurity measures are truly robust and whether agencies are properly equipped to respond.In today's climate, agroterrorism is no longer a distant threat, it is a real and growing risk.\", 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Researchers accused of biothreat smuggling; agroterrorism alert\\nENTITIES: US Department of Justice, Zunyong Liu, Yunqing Jian, Fusarium graminearum, University of Michigan, United Kingdom\\nEVENT: Two Chinese researchers are accused of smuggling a crop-destroying fungus into the United States.

He was later taken into custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and was being transported to a detention facility in Arizona, she said in an email to The Associated Press. The Trump administration said in court filings last month that it was working to bring him back after he was deported to Mexico, despite his fears of being harmed there, days after a federal judge ordered the administration to facilitate his return. The U.S. Department of Justice didn't immediately respond to a request for comments and details from the AP. The man, who is gay, was protected from being returned to his home country under a U.S. immigration judge’s order at the time. But the U.S. put him on a bus and sent him to Mexico instead, a removal that U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy found likely “lacked any semblance of due process.”Mexico later returned him to Guatemala, where he was in hiding, according to court documents. In a court filing before his return, government lawyers said that a so-called significant public benefit parole packet had been approved. The designation allows people who aren’t eligible to enter the U.S. to do so temporarily, often for reasons related to law enforcement or legal proceedings.An earlier court proceeding had determined that the man risked persecution or torture if returned to Guatemala. But he also feared returning to Mexico, where he says he was raped and extorted while seeking asylum in the U.S., according to court documents.“As far as we know, it is the first time since January 20 that (Department of Homeland Security) has facilitated return following a district court order,” Realmuto said. The case is among a string of findings by federal courts against recent Trump administration deportations. Those have included other deportations to third countries and the erroneous deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an El Salvadoran man who had lived in Maryland for roughly 14 years.The U.S. Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return to the U.S. from a notorious Salvadoran prison, rejecting the White House’s claim that it couldn’t retrieve him after mistakenly deporting him.

Despite years of international friction over the pipeline, he proposed to eventually activate it and deliver natural gas to Germany.The investor, Stephen P. Lynch, had already made the pitch to the Trump administration, which he was betting would want U.S. control over a pivotal piece of energy infrastructure. Now the Germans wanted to hear for themselves about Mr. Lynch’s proposal to lead a takeover of the much-criticized pipeline on the floor of the Baltic Sea, called Nord Stream 2.The German officials were skeptical in their May 6 meeting in Berlin, Mr. Lynch recalls, asking him how he intended to persuade them to allow Russian gas to flow through the pipeline, which was partially sabotaged in 2022. That was not his job, Mr. Lynch says he answered, predicting that the Germans would persuade themselves eventually of the benefits of buying cheap Russian gas again.Amid the frantic geopolitical jockeying of recent months, touched off by Mr. Trump’s re-engaging with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, the future of Europe’s energy supply has emerged as a source of tension and vulnerability as the continent seeks to chart an independent course.Leaders in Berlin and Brussels have maneuvered in recent weeks to foreclose any possibility of new Russian gas imports, seeking a decisive break with the decades before Moscow’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, when Europe’s reliance on cheap Russian energy gave the Kremlin a powerful point of leverage. When President Trump meets with Germany’s new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, at the White House on Thursday, Mr. Merz will reiterate his opposition to using Nord Stream 2 if the issue comes up, Mr. Merz’s spokesman said this week.As Russia mobilized for war, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. vowed that, if Moscow invaded, “there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2,” and he imposed sanctions on the state-controlled company that owned it, while Germany refused to allow the newly completed pipeline to begin operation. After the invasion, European businesses and governments sharply reduced their dependence on Russian gas, trying to punish Moscow economically even though the effort came at considerable cost to themselves.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: US eyes Russian gas for Europe supply\\nENTITIES: Russia, Germany, U.S., Vladimir V.

Not so much,” said Tanuja Chitnis, MD, senior neurologist, Brigham M ultiple S clerosis Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, at the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC) 2025 Annual Meeting.This not only applies to sNfL but other fluid biomarkers, including glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which has enormous promise for tracking and understanding the course of MS but also needs context and has important limitations.“We do not yet know for sure what the updated McDonald criteria will recommend specifically, but sNfL is not very helpful for diagnosis,” said Mark Freedman, MD, director of the Multiple Sclerosis Research Unit at the University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. He, like Chitnis, does not see sNfL as a diagnostic tool either as an isolated value or in the context of other currently available signs of disease.Most, if not all, patients with a diagnosis of MS who are eventually confirmed typically have elevated levels of sNfL, but Freedman, who led the symposium on fluid biomarkers said this information is not helpful. And sNfL, he noted climbs with neurodegeneration, but this is not unique to MS.Many other diseases associated with neuronal damage, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, are linked to much higher sNfL levels at diagnosis, underscoring its poor specificity, said Freedman, who has led consensus papers on its use. The most recent was published in 2024 on behalf of the CMSC.An Indicator of ResponseChitnis said sNfL may eventually play a role in MS diagnosis when combined with other variables, including fluid biomarkers, but for now, its primary value lies in disease management, where it serves as a sensitive tool for monitoring treatment response.A sensitive indicator of disease activity sNfL provides information beyond MRI, said Chitnis, who tracks levels every 3-6 months after initiating or switching therapy. A lack of decline may signal inadequate disease control. Freedman echoed this view, noting that if levels don’t drop within a few months of starting treatment, he begins to question its effectiveness — even before other signs of treatment failure appear.“If I do not see sNfL fall within a few months of starting therapy, I start questioning the therapy,” he said.The clinical value of sNfL was highlighted in a 2023 CSMC consensus paper, which endorsed its use for tracking recovery after relapse, guiding therapy decisions, and clarifying discrepancies between MRI and clinical findings. Since then, evidence supporting its use has only strengthened, Freedman said.“The tests are now accessible everywhere,” he said. He also noted that there is growing confidence that sNfL is a substitute for MRI in many specific scenarios, such as when access to MRI is limited by cost or distance to an imaging device.Multiple sNfL assays are available, but they are not interchangeable. They vary in sensitivity, turnaround time, methodology, and cutoff values — so any changes in sNfL levels must be tracked using the same assay throughout.“We have to be careful about using apps to interpret the results,” Chitnis cautioned, noting that such tools are now commercially available. She added that interpretation also depends on the reference population and can be influenced by factors like body mass index, renal function, and age.‘A Novel Window Into the Brain’The value of sNfL in monitoring treatment response — and in tasks such as assessing disease activity in patients with MS who have discontinued DMT — may be just the beginning for this biomarker, which is under active investigation for a range of additional uses, said Chitnis.She noted that the clinical utility of fluid biomarkers like sNfL is likely to expand significantly as researchers learn how to interpret them in combination. In several studies, pairing sNfL with GFAP has offered new insights into progressive MS, particularly when the two markers trend in opposite directions.Despite an imperfect correlation, patients with high GFAP but low sNfL, relative to the other way around, “probably represent our nonactive secondary progressive MS disease cohort,” Chitnis said.“This is getting at our understanding of who might be more progressive in regard to the loss of the glial structure in the brain,” she added.Meanwhile, other potential biomarkers associated with increased clinical and radiological MS activity are showing promise. In a recent study led by Chitnis, a panel of 20 such proteins correlated more precisely with gadolinium lesion activity, clinical relapse, and annualized relapse rate than sNfL alone.Ultimately, fluid biomarkers like sNfL are providing “a novel window into the brain” relevant not just to monitoring disease but potentially revealing the sequence of underlying pathophysiology of MS, said Chitnis.These appear to differentiate relatively benign disease from events leading to the irreversible damage of late stages progression.Chitnis reported financial relationships with more than 15 pharmaceutical or device companies, including those that produce assays for sNfL. Freedman reported financial relationships with more than 20 pharmaceutical or device companies, including those that produce assays for sNfL.', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: sNfL biomarker not suitable for MS diagnosis\\nENTITIES: Tanuja Chitnis, Mark Freedman, Brigham Multiple Sclerosis Center, Harvard Medical School, Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers, University of Ottawa\\nEVENT: Experts at CMSC 2025 Annual Meeting say serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) lacks specificity for diagnosing multiple sclerosis (MS) and will not be included in upcoming revisions to the McDonald criteria, though it is useful for monitoring treatment response.\\nCONTEXT: sNfL is valuable for monitoring MS treatment response, not diagnosis.', 'createdAt': '2025-06-05T08:04:47.658Z'}, {'id': 104729, 'sourceId': 12314, 'url': 'https://www.foxnews.com/sports/stephen-a-smiths-prime-siriusxm-slot-blindsides-current-host-michelle-beadle-little-embarrassing', 'title': \"Stephen A.

And while both are still major players in the design world and beyond, a fresh crowd of designers is quietly attracting a new style set and a different style, with many of their biggest name clients shielded by NDAs or sworn to secrecy.At the forefront of this group is Pimlico-based Rose Uniacke, whose refined sense of luxury has ushered in a fresh and understated look in the London homes of the Beckhams and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley (which we crane to see more of in the back of every Instagram post). Uniacke doesn’t have the monopoly though; there are dozens of smaller studios capturing the imaginations of cool creatives who, as they get on the capital’s property ladder, are swapping their appreciation for shoes in favour of swatches.

Folkestone-based Rowell used to be a fashion stylist before switching her masterful eye to interiors. Interiors by Côte de Folk which was founded by former fashion stylist Sophie RowellSuppliedCrowned a rising star by House & Garden in 2022, she has a predilection for vintage finds and injecting neutral-adjacent spaces with an unexpected pattern (hello, gingham lino) or material (cork for skirting boards?

If you’ve found yourself hankering after a tiled worktop or an antique linen shower curtain, it’s likely because of Rowell’s influence.

She operates discreetly from her Camden HQ and has been designing under her own steam for more than 25 years. Interestingly, she recently downsized from Acton to Zone 1, transforming Amy Winehouse’s local off-licence into her studio, and lives upstairs with husband Nick, a furniture-maker and veteran of the London antiques trade.The Joanna Plant-designed living room at Poppy Delevingne’s home in west LondonSupplied A client who is happy to shout about Plant’s talent from the rooftops is model Poppy Delevingne.

And it hasn’t aged one bit in the years since: decadent and playful, the ground floor was inspired by “naughty hotel rooms” and features a navy-blue sitting room and a glossy red bar. Upstairs, the boudoir-like bedroom is powder-pink with an en-suite bathroom wrapped in handpainted wallpaper by de Gournay. In short, Plant ensured the decor was as fun-loving as the model herself.Joanna Plant is the designer to the stars who you’ve likely never heard of — so many of her projects are bound by NDAsBeata HeumanBeata Heuman, a petite Swede with big ideas, honed her craft under the inimitable Nicky Haslam before launching her own practice more than a decade ago. Ever since she won House & Garden’s inaugural interior designer of the year award in 2018 there’s been no stopping her. Her international client base is drawn to her eclectic eye; there have been brownstones in Manhattan, summer houses in Nantucket and London lofts. Top model Adwoa Aboah’s west London home@simonuptonphotosIn 2023, Heuman decorated top model Adwoa Aboah’s west London house and it was ceremoniously splashed on the cover of Architectural Digest magazine. “She’s mega,” said Aboah of her designer, explaining how, “I’m prone to fluffy pink, Hello Kitty, leopard print — anything that’s repulsively tacky, so it’s quite good to have someone tone that down.” Heuman’s legions of admirers (ie, those without the hedge fund manager budgets) find comfort in her book, Every Room Should Sing, which takes pride of place on many coffee tables. And every so often, they splash out on a little something from her online “Shoppa” selection: a bow-shaped brass handle here, or a duvet cover there, in order to usher in a little touch of Beata magic to elevate the everyday.A project in north London by Beata HeumanSuppliedMartin WallerThe model and TV personality Abbey Clancy wanted the capacious Surrey home she shares with her retired footballer husband Peter Crouch and their four kids “to reflect my life, my family and all the vibrancy and love that comes with it”. So to help her, she enlisted Martin Waller, founder of furnishings brand Andrew Martin, who has been in the game longer than Clancy has been alive. “Martin is a maverick, a trailblazer and I’m obsessed with everything he does. I’ve learnt from working with him over the years — he won’t settle with ordinary, so we have to search for the extraordinary,” she enthuses. Abbey Clancy worked with Martin Waller to design her homes in Surrey and PortugalSuppliedThe two have been antiquing around Paris flea markets to fill Clancy’s home with unique pieces, and he has also helped with the couple’s holiday home in Portugal. “He’s completely changed my outlook on interior design. He opens your eyes to the world’s vast cultures, styles, textures and how he arranges, mixes and layers things. I love that now when I walk through my house everything has a story.”Once a derelict Victorian workshop, Rachel Chudley’s former home featured a basement living space with smoky blue fireplace and leopard-print sofaJuliet MurphyRachel ChudleyChudley is another whose high-profile clients — think music execs and actors — prefer to keep their names out of the spotlight, but blue-blooded couple Tish Weinstock and Tom Guinness were happy to share their London mews with the world a few years back. A dramatic setting where wall tapestries were suspended alongside mid-century seating, the Holland Park home typifies Chudley’s theatrical approach. Doing away with “rules” and preconceived notions of good taste, in Chudley’s world you can wrap walls in velvet, make your headboard wonderfully asymmetric, and double-down on a love for animal print. The kitchen in her former house (a derelict Victorian workshop which she spent a year renovating) featured a basement kitchen drenched in glossy midnight blue.

This equates to just over 17 percent of the population.Among those with a substance use disorder, just over 27 million had a drug addiction specifically.To prevent more lives from being lost to substance abuse, Trump has proposed major changes to be made to SAMHSA as well as other agencies, alongside cracking down on drug trafficking at the U.S.-Mexico border.However, experts have weighed in on what they think should be done to tackle the issue, and their suggestions differ from what Republican policymakers are currently implementing.\\nPhoto-illustration by Newsweek/Getty/Canva\\nWhat Has The Trump Administration Done To Tackle Addiction So Far?In March 2025, the Health and Human Services Department (HHS) announced that major changes would be made to SAMHSA and that it would be combined with other agencies as part of the \"Make America Healthy Again\" (MAHA) campaign.HHS wrote that the plan would increase the \"operational efficiency\" of SAMHSA, and more widely, the consolidation of various agencies would save taxpayers $1.8 billion per year through a reduction in workforce.The streamlining of various agencies has allegedly led to a reduction of around 50 percent of the staff at SAMHSA so far, according to Paolo del Vecchio, the former Director of the Office of Recovery at SAMHSA, who spoke to the substance use disorder website Addiction Center.When approached for comment, a SAMHSA spokesperson told Newsweek: \"The SAMHSA employees affected were in administrative roles.\"They added: \"The agency remains committed to ensuring that essential mental health and substance use services are available to Americans in need. Our grants, programs, and initiatives continue to support the President\\'s vision to Make America Healthy Again by addressing the critical behavioral health challenges facing our citizens.\"There are also proposed cuts to various agencies as part of the GOP budget bill, which includes a $1 billion cut in funding for SAMHSA, according to Addiction Center.Cuts to the agency\\'s funding, the Trump administration allegedly said, are being proposed because \"SAMHSA grants were used to fund dangerous activities billed as \\'harm reduction,\\' which included funding \\'safe smoking kits and supplies\\' and \\'syringes\\' for drug users.\"Newsweek has contacted the White House via email for comment from the Office of Management and Budget in regards to the budgetary changes to SAMHSA.What Experts Think Needs To Be DoneHowever, despite the Trump administration\\'s efforts to tackle the issue, experts have said that more needs to be done.\"To reduce the prevalence of substance use disorder, the Administration should invest in prevention to reduce the number of people who develop the disorder in the first place,\" Keith Humphreys OBE, the Esther Ting Memorial professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University, California, told Newsweek.As substance use disorders often go hand-in-hand with other health conditions, \"this also means that if you treat substance use disorder, you get benefits in other areas of health,\" he added.\"So Medicaid paying for addiction treatment over time may actually reduce costs to Medicaid as people with substance use disorders don\\'t develop or resolve other health problems for which they would otherwise need care,\" Humphreys said.Individuals with substance use disorders can develop other health problems like infectious diseases, injuries, and poor mental health, he said.\"It thus costs more to cover the health care for someone with a substance use disorder than without,\" Humphreys added.Corroborating this, Peggy Quigg, a member of the President\\'s Senior Service Advisors at the WestCare Foundation, a non-profit organization providing behavioral and mental health services in various locations throughout the country, told Newsweek that the effects of \"long-term, chronic substance use takes a great toll on most of the organs in the body.\"As patients seek help for substance use, she added, medical providers \"often discover additional undiagnosed and untreated medical problems especially with the endocrine system, liver, pancreas, stomach, liver, lungs and brain.\"The result of this is that those with substance use disorders have significantly higher costs than those without, so investing in preventative care could actually save costs in the long term.Spending on Medicaid enrollees with a substance use disorder diagnosis is twice as much as those without—a difference of around $1,200 compared to $550 per month on average, according to KFF.Humphreys added that alongside investment in treatment, there also needs to be \"recovery services that lead people out of addiction and into a healthier life.\"The need to invest, rather than make cuts to funding, within the sector is something Quigg also said was crucial.\"States and local communities have had successful programs in place that have just lost funding all across the country with the changes in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorneys Offices,\" she said.She added that \"study after study has demonstrated that prevention works, we need more of it, and it is cost-effective.\"\"We are at an extraordinary moment of opportunity in the drug overdose crisis as deaths are finally starting to come down in a meaningful way,\" Brendan Saloner, a professor of health policy and management at the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Maryland, told Newsweek.\"Reducing the investment in treatment could completely undermine the recent progress we\\'ve seen as more people are getting treatment paid for with Medicaid funds,\" he added.', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Experts Disagree with Trump's Addiction Strategy\\nENTITIES: Donald Trump,

Addressing the industry challenge of insufficient penetration of industrial robots in unstructured environments, DEEP Robotics recently launched the medium-sized wheel-legged robot LYNX M20. Combining both wheeled and legged mobility capabilities, it is designed for demanding operational scenarios, driving intelligent upgrades across various applications including industrial inspection and emergency rescue operations.\\nCurrently, manual inspection in substations faces multiple challenges including low efficiency, inconsistent standards, and poor adaptability to harsh environments, with subjective experience compromising assessment objectivity. Handheld devices used in power distribution stations suffer from inadequate real-time performance, insufficient accuracy, and operational complexity. Meanwhile, manual inspections of transmission lines and tunnels present dual risks of compromised precision and safety hazards. The existing operation and maintenance system urgently requires intelligent technological solutions to address these critical shortcomings in efficiency, accuracy, and safety dimensions.\\nOmni-terrain Operational Expertise: Powering Intelligent Transformation in the Energy Sector\\nTo address these issues, the application of intelligent unmanned inspection technology in substations has gradually gained widespread attention, as it can effectively improve substation operation and maintenance efficiency, reduce labor costs, and ensure the safe and stable operation of power systems. LYNX M20 is a new wheel-legged robot capable of autonomous intelligent inspection, combining the all-terrain obstacle-crossing capability of traditional legged robots with the rapid mobility of wheeled systems, featuring an effective payload of 15kg and a maximum payload of 50kg to meet the requirements for carrying various detection equipment during power inspections. Under effective payload conditions, LYNX M20 achieves 2.5 hours of runtime with a maximum sustained operating speed of 2 m/s and a maximum range of 15 km. Additionally, LYNX M20’s unique ‘front-elbow-rear-knee’ symmetrical joint structure（which is directionally agnostic, allowing forward and reverse movement and turning without body rotation）and night fill lights enable it to freely navigate 50cm narrow passages without difficulty in confined spaces like substation equipment rooms and utility tunnels under low-light conditions. Simultaneously, it possesses autonomous charging, environmental perception, and fault diagnosis functions, enabling comprehensive, high-frequency substation inspections.\\nLYNX M20 can be equipped with a variety of advanced sensors, which can monitor the operation status of substation in real time and find potential problems in time. The dual-spectrum pan/tilt it can carry combines visible light imaging and infrared thermal imaging technology. Through visual identification, it can not only visually present the physical damage of the equipment, but also detect the internal heat abnormality of the equipment with the help of infrared radiation imaging differences, such as local overheating of the transformer winding or poor contact of the cable connector, so as to help the operation and maintenance personnel quickly locate the fault and judge the cause. In addition, the robot dog can be equipped with voiceprint and gas sensor, which can identify subtle defects such as abnormal sound and partial discharge of cooler, and monitor the concentration of harmful gas in the air in real time to ensure production safety. At the same time, LYNX M20 equipped with inspection system can analyze the images and data information monitored by sensors, and automatically generate inspection reports to further improve inspection efficiency.\\nIP66 Industrial-Grade Rugged Protection Ensures All-Weather Operation\\nIP66 (International Protection rating) indicates the product is completely protected against foreign object intrusion and dust ingress, and when subjected to powerful water jets or heavy seas, the amount of water entering the equipment shall not reach harmful levels. The industrial-grade IP66 protection emphasizes reliability under dynamic operating conditions, with its technical certification comprising two dimensions: the first digit represents dustproof level, requiring high-density dust protection with zero penetration after 8-hour dust chamber testing; the second digit represents waterproof level, demanding dynamic water resistance capable of withstanding 12.5L/min high-pressure spraying (equivalent to continuous impact from three fire hoses).\\nIn real industrial inspection processes, there exist harsh environments with high temperatures, sand, and dust that impose extremely stringent protection requirements on robots. LYNX M20 possesses an IP66 protection rating, demonstrating exceptional waterproof, dustproof, and impact-resistant capabilities. In adverse conditions such as rainy or dusty weather, it can still operate normally without equipment damage or failure caused by environmental factors. Its operating temperature range extends from -20°C to 55°C, enabling LYNX M20 to work stably in extreme temperature environments and significantly expanding its applicable regions and seasonal limitations. Whether in substations in cold regions or during inspections of power facilities in hot zones, LYNX M20 can reliably perform its tasks.\\nAutonomous Navigation Patrol with Intelligent Algorithm Recognition\\nSLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) is the core technology for robotic autonomous navigation. Simply put, it enables robots to achieve ‘trinity’ capabilities in unknown environments like humans: 1. Where am I? (Localization) – Using sensors like LiDAR and cameras to perceive the surrounding environment in real-time while simultaneously calculating its own position. 2. What does the surroundings look like? (Mapping) – Continuously creating high-precision (2D/3D) maps of the environment while moving, marking key information such as obstacles and terrain features. 3. How to get there safely? (Navigation) – Planning optimal paths based on map and localization data, with real-time obstacle avoidance and posture adjustment.\\nLYNX M20 collects and processes environmental data hundreds of thousands of times per second, just like “digital consciousness” with spatial cognition. Even in complex scenes such as tunnels and ruins, it can calculate its posture in real time and reconstruct a three-dimensional environmental model with centimeter-level accuracy. For unstructured terrain such as mountains and steep slopes, this robot, as an industrial robot, has a 96-line laser radar and a large visual field of 360°×90°, which can intelligently perceive the terrain and adjust its motion posture independently according to the terrain with AI motion control algorithm. It can also achieve omni-directional obstacle avoidance independently, easily cope with extreme environments such as rough mountain roads, muddy wetlands and ruins obstacles, and truly become an intelligent mobile platform specially built for complex terrain and dangerous environments.\\nPioneer in Legged Robotics Industrial Applications\\nAs the world’s first wheel-legged hybrid robot specifically designed for complex terrains and hazardous environments in industrial applications, the newly launched LYNX M20 breaks operational boundaries with its omnidirectional capabilities, establishing itself as a supremely capable intelligent mobile platform for industries. Currently, LYNX M20 is penetrating more application scenarios to deliver scalable intelligent solutions. For instance, in emergency firefighting, it overcomes environmental constraints like thick smoke, high temperatures, and oxygen deficiency to enter disaster zones, providing rapid situational feedback for precision rescue decision-making. In logistics delivery, it achieves last-meter precision by flexibly navigating narrow pathways and staircases in residential areas, solving the ‘last-mile’ delivery challenge.

Trump declared that it would jeopardize national security to allow Harvard to continue hosting foreign students.The proclamation is the US president’s latest attempt to choke the Ivy League school from an international pipeline that accounts for a quarter of the student body, and a further escalation in the White House’s fight with the institution.“I have determined that the entry of the class of foreign nationals described above is detrimental to the interests of the United States because, in my judgment, Harvard’s conduct has rendered it an unsuitable destination for foreign students and researchers,” Trump wrote in the order.Trump’s proclamation also directs the US state department to consider revoking academic or exchange visas of any current Harvard students who meet his proclamation’s criteria.Harvard in a statement called Trump’s proclamation “yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard’s First Amendment rights.”“Harvard will continue to protect its international students.”Trump singled out Harvard’s connections with China as reason for cutting off the university from foreign students. The proclamation said Harvard was linked to research that “could advance China’s military modernisation”.The statement also said Harvard was considered the top “party school” for Chinese Communist party bureaucrats and noted that the daughter of Xi Jinping, China’s leader, attended in the early 2010s.In the early 2000s, Harvard ran a “China Leaders in Development” programme in conjunction with Tsinghua University in Beijing for Chinese government officials.“I don’t think this is going to benefit US universities at all,” said a Chinese undergraduate student with an offer to study at Harvard on a master’s degree starting next term who asked that his name be withheld. “It’s causing normal people, us students, a lot of anxiety.”The Trump administration has been engaged in a tense standoff with Harvard, the US’s oldest and wealthiest university, freezing billions of dollars in grants and other funding and proposing to end its tax-exempt status, prompting a series of legal challenges.Harvard argues the administration is retaliating against it for refusing to accede to its demands to control the school’s governance, curriculum and the ideology of its faculty and students.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionHarvard sued after the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, on 22 May announced her department was immediately revoking Harvard’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, which allows it to enrol foreign students.Her action was almost immediately temporarily blocked by a Boston court. On the eve of a hearing before her last week, the department changed course and said it would instead challenge Harvard’s certification through a lengthier administrative process.Trump’s order on Wednesday invokes a different legal authority than the earlier move by the Department of Homeland Security. The legal justification for the ban, Trump said, are sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act, “which authorize the President to suspend entry of any class of aliens whose entry would be detrimental to the interests of the United States”.Trump officials have repeatedly raised the stakes and sought new fronts to pressure Harvard, cutting more than $2.6bn in research grants and moving to end all federal contracts with the university. The latest threat has targeted Harvard’s roughly 7,000 international students, who account for half the enrolment at some Harvard graduate schools.“President Trump wants our institutions to have foreign students, but believes that the foreign students should be people that can love our country,” the White House said in a fact sheet about the proclamation.Wednesday’s two-page directive said Harvard had “demonstrated a history of concerning foreign ties and radicalism” and had “extensive entanglements with foreign adversaries” including China.As well as the spat with Harvard, the White House has pledged to “aggressively revoke” visas for Chinese students across the country, especially those with links to the CCP or in “critical fields”.', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Trump restricts foreign student visas at Harvard\\nENTITIES: Donald Trump, Harvard University, China, Xi Jinping\\nEVENT: Donald Trump signed a proclamation restricting foreign student visas at Harvard, citing national security concerns and Harvard's ties to China, including research that could advance China's military modernization and its status as a top 'party school' for Chinese Communist Party bureaucrats.\\nCONTEXT: This is the latest escalation in the White House's fight with Harvard, following previous actions like freezing grants and challenging its tax-exempt status.\", 'createdAt': '2025-06-05T08:04:47.658Z'}, {'id': 105830, 'sourceId': 12651, 'url': 'https://www.express.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/2064571/reeves-new-pension-rules-omission-key-issue-back-burner', 'title': \"Reeves' new pension rules 'omission' as key issue on 'back burner'\", 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T05:25:00.000Z', 'content': 'The Pension Schemes Bill will create \"bigger and better pension funds\" and combine smaller pension pots, the Government said By\\xa0Steven Smith, Content Editor 06:25, Thu, Jun 5, 2025 | UPDATED: 06:27, Thu, Jun 5, 2025 Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves (Image: Getty Images)Sweeping reforms to tidy up the fragmented pensions landscape are detailed in a new parliamentary Bill, promising to build \"megafunds\" and eradicate numerous \"micro\" retirement savings. The Pension Schemes Bill aims to craft \"bigger and better pension funds\" by amalgamating smaller pension pots, as per Government statements - but it has already drawn criticism for doing \\'nothing to tackle the fundamental problem\\'.The common issue of workers accruing multiple modest pension amounts, which become cumbersome to manage with frequent job changes, is addressed in the Bill, which will consolidate micro pension pots valued at or below £1,000 into a single scheme.As individuals near retirement age, the legislation will compel schemes to present unambiguous, default choices to convert savings into a steady retirement income.Furthermore, the Bill introduces stringent regulations ushering in vast multi-employer defined contribution (DC) scheme megafunds with a minimum value of £25 billion, exploiting scale to diversify investments.According to Government officials, defined benefit (DB) pension systems will receive augmented leeway to \"safely\" allocate surplus assets collectively worth £160 billion, intended to bolster employer investment ventures and enhance member benefits.Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said: \"The Bill is about securing better value for savers\\' pensions and driving long-term investment in British businesses to boost economic growth in our country.\"Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall (Image: Parliament TV)Chancellor Rachel Reeves called the plans \"a game changer\".Pensions minister Torsten Bell added: \"Pension saving is a long game, but getting this right is urgent so that millions can look forward to a higher income in retirement.\"But former Liberal Democrat pensions minister and now partner at LCP, Sir Steve Webb has criticised the new Bill for its lack of significant action on boosting pension savings, saying: \"Whilst there are many worthy measures in the Bill, the biggest omission is action to get more money flowing into pensions.\"This issue is unfortunately on the back burner. Measures such as consolidating tiny pension pots are helpful tidying up measures, but do nothing to tackle the fundamental problem that millions of us simply do not have enough money set aside for our retirement.\"With every passing year that this issue goes unaddressed, time is running out for people already well through their working life to have the chance for a decent retirement.\"Patrick Heath-Lay, chief executive of People\\'s Partnership which provides the People\\'s Pension, praised some aspects of the Bill: \"The Bill contains many measures that will require providers to deliver better outcomes for savers and improve the workplace pension system.\"We are encouraged by the introduction of default consolidator schemes, which will be the most effective way to solve the dormant small pots problem.\"Andy Briggs, the CEO of Phoenix Group, said: \"The Bill sets a clear direction for the future of pensions with the emphasis on building scale and ensuring savers receive value for money.\"Ian Cornelius, CEO of Nest, said: \"We believe that large, well-governed schemes can drive great outcomes for their members by using their scale and expertise to diversify where money is invested, and gain access to attractive investment opportunities not available to smaller investors at low cost.\"Nausicaa Delfas, chief executive of the Pensions Regulator, commented on the future-proofing efforts: \"Making sure all schemes are focused on delivering value for money, helping to stop small, and often forgotten pension pots forming, and guiding savers towards the right retirement products for them, will mean savers benefit from a system fit for the future.\" Invalid emailWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you\\'ve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

How to be well at the Hajj', 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T06:22:19.000Z', 'content': \"ISLAMABAD -- Hajj is the annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca that is required once in a lifetime of every Muslim who can afford it and is physically able to do it. It is a spiritual highlight for those fortunate enough to go, but it is also grueling and stressful.Pilgrims conduct their rituals outdoors, among huge crowds, walking up to 25 kilometers (15 miles) a day. There is often no privacy or personal space. Languages, routines and surroundings can feel unfamiliar, and the emotional impact of doing the Hajj can also take its toll.Here are some ways to be well at the Hajj.Pilgrims work on their spiritual readiness to undertake the Hajj, but equally important is their physical preparation. Saudi authorities have published a 45-page safety kit in eight languages. It encourages people to do aerobic exercises for 30 minutes daily and to “make movement activities” like using the stairs instead of the elevator, before they travel to Saudi Arabia.There’s a lot of walking at the Hajj, even when pilgrims are not performing rituals. Too much traffic, or not enough transport, means people end up walking up to 25 kilometers (15 miles) every day. All the rituals are on foot.High temperatures, adrenaline, and physical exertion will elevate the heart rate. If pilgrims are not used to working out, they should have at least prepared their bodies for the long periods that will be spent outdoors and upright, as going from an inactive or sedentary lifestyle straight to the Hajj will be a shock to the system. This year, temperatures at the Hajj are expected to reach 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit). The body’s resting core temperature is typically about 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit), just 4 degrees Celsius (7 degrees Fahrenheit) away from catastrophe in the form of heatstroke.The bigger killer in the heat is the strain on the heart, especially for people who have cardiovascular disease. Blood rushes to the skin to help shed core heat, causing blood pressure to drop. The heart responds by trying to pump more blood to keep someone from passing out. Avoid going out during the day unless necessary. Seek shade and rest often, despite the temptation to go at top speed. The Hajj is a marathon not a sprint.White or pale-colored clothing and UV umbrellas reflect the sunlight, meaning your body and clothing won’t get as hot. Oral rehydration sachets can help replenish electrolytes lost through sweating and physical exertion. There are also hands-free “Hajj” umbrellas that are worn on the head, allowing pilgrims to pray and carry out their rituals unencumbered. Avoid new shoes, says Dr. Hina Shahid, the London-based chair of the Muslim Doctors Association. “If you have new shoes, break them in beforehand. Make sure your footwear is comfortable. You don't want to get blisters.”Well-fitting sandals or sliders are fine for Mecca, which has well-paved roads and sidewalks. It is common to see Muslims streaming into the city by foot. There is smooth tiling on the outer courtyard of the Grand Mosque that is washed by an army of cleaners at regular intervals. But pilgrims go barefoot when circling the Kaaba, where the marble flooring is cool to the skin whatever the weather. But the terrain changes in Muzdalifah, where people collect pebbles to use in the symbolic stoning of pillars representing the devil. They also spend the night in the open air so it's better to wear a sturdier, closed-toe shoe and also at Mount Arafat, where people clamber over rocks to reach the hill’s 70-meter-high (230 feet) summit to spend hours in prayer.Cough? Runny nose? Sore throat? Fever? That's “Hajj flu,” a nickname for the respiratory infection that people develop during the crowded conditions of the pilgrimage.It's common to see people wearing face masks during the Hajj, even though face coverings are not a religious requirement, because they are in close proximity to each other, making droplet infections inevitable. Pilgrims are exposed to new germs, new environments and new routines. These are tough on the immune system when combined.To minimize the chances of developing the Hajj flu or giving it to others, pilgrims should wash their hands well, especially before eating and after sneezing, coughing or using the bathroom. Coughing or sneezing into the arm or elbow can help prevent the spread of germs when a tissue isn't available. It's worth sanitizing frequently touched objects and surfaces in the camps at Mina and opening windows for ventilation.It's important to stay on top of mandatory and recommended vaccinations before traveling to Saudi Arabia.The Hajj can be daunting because of its scale, religious significance, practical difficulties, the expense, the physical exertion and the pressure to get it right. It is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, the core beliefs and acts of worship that Muslims must practice.It can feel tough to fulfill this obligation when you're away from home comforts. Not following your normal routine, sleep deprivation, vast cultural and linguistic differences, and being surrounded by upward of 1.5 million strangers add to the challenges. You can't even wear your regular clothes.These factors can rattle your calm, kindness and patience. Prioritizing your health, and resting whenever needed, can alleviate some of the stress. Focusing on what you are doing, rather than comparing yourself to others, can also relieve the pressure.Being grateful for the opportunity to be at the Hajj will help remind you why you are there. Talking to friends and family back home will ground you.Hajj is about endurance, humility, mindfulness and struggle. A willingness to let go of negative emotions.It’s a test of your spiritual connection with God, even when everything around you is testing that connection.___Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Gellerson for The New York TimesJune 5, 2025Updated 12:20 a.m. ETAs the world condemned the killings this week of dozens of hungry Palestinians near U.S.-backed aid sites in Gaza, the group responsible for distributing that aid quietly appointed a new leader: an evangelical Christian with ties to the Trump administration.The group, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which was founded last year, announced on Tuesday that Johnnie Moore, an American public relations professional, would be its new executive chairman after the previous chief quit.Mr. Moore’s appointment comes as the foundation — which began handing out food boxes last week — temporarily halted operations on Wednesday to work on “organization and efficiency.” It had been racked by a resignation in its ranks, chaos at its distribution sites and violence nearby, including two shooting episodes in which dozens of Palestinians were killed, according to local health workers.Here is what to know about Mr. Moore and his ties to the Trump administration.ImagePeople carrying boxes and bags containing food and humanitarian aid packages distributed by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation last month in Rafah, in southern Gaza.Credit...Mariam Dagga/Associated PressA presence in the Oval OfficeMr. Moore was a spokesman for Liberty University, the Christian institution founded in Lynchburg, Va., in 1971 by the Rev. Jerry Falwell, for a dozen years before moving into the media industry and starting his own faith-based public relations firm.He represented early evangelical supporters of President Trump, including Jerry Falwell Jr., who succeeded his father at Liberty University, and Paula White, who now leads the White House faith office.Mr. Moore was co-chairman of the 2016 Trump presidential campaign’s evangelical advisory board and an influential figure during Mr. Trump’s first administration. He was part of a coalition of Christian leaders who paid regular visits to the White House, attending policy briefings, as well as prayer meetings in the Oval Office.His public relations company, Kairos, was acquired in 2022 by JDA Worldwide, and Mr. Moore now serves as president of that larger firm. When he announced the acquisition on social media, Mr. Moore referred to his work in public relations as his “day job,” as he has had many other roles and projects linked to his faith and interest in foreign policy, including writing books on the persecution of Christians in the Middle East and Africa.ImageIn 2018, the Trump administration recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Ivanka Trump and others were on hand when the United States Embassy was moved from Tel Aviv Aviv to the city.Credit...Ronen Zvulun/ReutersA faith-based advocate for IsraelIn 2017, Mr. Moore told The New York Times that he and other evangelicals had pressed Mr. Trump to recognize Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem and to move the U.S. Embassy there. “It has been an issue of priority for a long time,” he said.Mr. Moore describes himself as “a bridge builder and peacemaker especially known for consequential work at the intersection of faith and foreign policy, especially in the Middle East.”The embassy move drew condemnation from Palestinian and Arab leaders, the heads of many Christian churches in Jerusalem and much of the international community, which has long viewed the status of Jerusalem as a matter to be resolved through negotiations over a future Palestinian state.A cheerleader for Mike HuckabeeMr. Moore, like many evangelicals, including Mike Huckabee, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, is committed to a Jewish state based on his interpretation of the Bible.Some evangelicals view their support for Israel as an important element of their belief in biblical prophecy. Speaking to The Washington Post in 2018, Mr. Moore said he had advised White House officials that “those who bless Israel will be blessed.”Mr. Moore cheered Mr. Huckabee’s nomination, saying on social media in November that “selecting a lifelong non-Jewish Zionist as the U.S. ambassador to Israel sends a powerful message to friend and foe of America.”Mr. Huckabee, 69, and Mr. Moore, 41, have walked similar paths as public figures and Christian media creators, and they have been described as friends in Israeli news media. The embassy did not respond to a request for comment on their relationship.The new face of a troubled Gaza organizationIsrael imposed a blockade on supplies entering the Gaza Strip in March, accusing Hamas of looting humanitarian aid. That embargo was lifted to a limited degree last month, after the international community raised alarms about widespread hunger in the enclave.Israelis conceived of the new system to establish aid distribution sites run by American security contractors in the enclave. It was meant, officials said, to circumvent Hamas, which Israel accused of stealing assistance meant for civilians.But the rollout of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation’s operation has been chaotic. Its previous head resigned hours before the initiative was set to begin late last month, citing a lack of autonomy. On Tuesday, Boston Consulting Group, a U.S. advisory firm, said that it had stepped back from its involvement with the organization, that it had placed a partner who had worked on the project on leave and that it would conduct an internal review of its work.Humanitarian organizations have criticized the foundation’s approach to aid distribution for a lack of independence from Israel, whose soldiers are positioned near the sites and have fired what the Israeli military has called “warning” shots on multiple occasions. And the United Nations has refused to have anything to do with the effort because it says Israel is militarizing and politicizing humanitarian assistance and putting Palestinians in danger.As reports of disarray at aid distribution sites emerged during the project’s first week, Mr. Moore said the effort was “working” and should be “celebrated.”When the Gazan health authorities reported shooting deaths near one of the foundation’s sites, Mr. Moore reposted a statement from Mr. Huckabee accusing the news media and Hamas of spreading misinformation.Mr. Moore lists 18 years of service with World Help, a Christian humanitarian organization, among his volunteer experiences, along with his new appointment at the Gaza foundation and his roles on various advisory boards, including that of the nonpartisan advocacy group Muslim Coalition for America and Haifa University in Israel.In a statement about his appointment, Mr. Moore said he would help “ensure the humanitarian aid community and the broader international community understand what’s taking place on the ground.” The foundation declined a request for an interview.Ephrat Livni is a reporter for The Times’s DealBook newsletter, based in Washington.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Trump Ally to Lead Gaza Aid Group\\nENTITIES: Johnnie Moore, Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, Trump administration, Israel, Gaza\\nEVENT: Johnnie Moore, a former Trump advisor, was appointed executive chairman of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation after its aid rollout faced chaos and violence, including shootings of Palestinians.\\nCONTEXT: Moore's appointment raises questions about the foundation's independence and ties to the Trump administration amidst criticism of aid distribution methods.\", 'createdAt': '2025-06-05T08:04:47.658Z'}, {'id': 107531, 'sourceId': 927, 'url': 'https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/wwii-veterans-speak-sacrifice-freedom-frances-day-battlefields-122522021', 'title': \"WWII veterans speak of sacrifice and freedom on France's D-Day battlefields, 81 years later\", 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T06:38:23.000Z', 'content': 'OMAHA BEACH, France -- The D-Day generation, smaller in number than ever, is back on the beaches of France where so much blood was spilled 81 years ago. World War II veterans, now mostly centenarians, have returned with the same message they fought for then: Freedom is worth defending.In what they acknowledge may be one of their last hurrahs, a group of nearly two dozen veterans who served in Europe and the Pacific is commemorating the fallen and getting rock-star treatment this week in Normandy — the first patch of mainland France that Allied forces liberated with the June 6, 1944, invasion and the greatest assembly of ships and planes the world had known.On what became known as “ Bloody Omaha ” and other gun-swept beaches where soldiers waded ashore and were cut down, their sacrifices forged bonds among Europe, the United States and Canada that endure, outlasting geopolitical shifts and the rise and fall of political leaders who blow hot and cold about the ties between nations.In Normandy, families hand down D-Day stories like heirlooms from one generation to the next. They clamor for handshakes, selfies, kisses and autographs from WWII veterans, and reward them with cries of “Merci!” — thank you.Both the young and the very old thrive off the interactions. French schoolchildren oohed and aahed when 101-year-old Arlester Brown told them his age. The U.S. military was still segregated by race when the 18-year-old was drafted in 1942. Like most Black soldiers, Brown wasn\\'t assigned a combat role and served in a laundry unit that accompanied the Allied advances through France and the Low Countries and into Nazi Germany.Jack Stowe, who lied about being 15 to join the Navy after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941, said he gets “the sweetest letters” from kids he met on previous trips.“The French people here, they’re so good to us,” the 98-year-old said, on a walk to the water\\'s edge on Omaha. “They want to talk to us, they want to sit down and they want their kids around us.”“People are not going to let it be forgotten, you know, Omaha, these beaches,” he said. “These stories will go on and on and on.”At the Normandy American Cemetery that overlooks Omaha, the resting place for nearly 9,400 American war dead, workers and visitors rub sand from the beach onto the white gravestones so the engraved names stand out.Wally King, a sprightly 101-year-old, wiped off excess sand with a weathered hand, resting the other atop the white cross, before saying a few words at the grave of Henry Shurlds Jr. Shurlds flew P-47 Thunderbolt fighters like King and was shot down and killed on Aug. 19, 1944. In the woods where they found his body, the townspeople of Verneuil-sur-Seine, northwest of Paris, erected a stele of Mississippi tulip tree wood in his memory.Although Shurlds flew in the same 513th Fighter Squadron, King said he never met him. King himself was shot down over Germany and badly burned on his 75th and last mission in mid-April 1945, weeks before the Nazi surrender. He said pilots tended not to become fast friends, to avoid the pain of loss when they were killed, which was often.When “most veterans from World War II came home, they didn’t want to talk about the war. So they didn’t pass those experiences on to their children and grandchildren,” King said.“In a way, that’s good because there’s enough unpleasantness, bloodshed, agony in war, and perhaps we don’t need to emphasize it,\" he added. \"But the sacrifice needs to be emphasized and celebrated.”With the march of time, the veterans\\' groups are only getting smaller.The Best Defense Foundation, a non-profit that has been running veteran trips to Normandy since 2004, last year brought 50 people for the 80th anniversary of D-Day. This year, the number is 23.Betty Huffman-Rosevear, who served as an army nurse, is the only woman. She turned 104 this week. The group also includes a renowned romantic: 101-year-old Harold Terens and his sweetheart, Jeanne Swerlin, were feted by France\\'s president after they tied the knot in a symbolic wedding inland of the D-Day beaches last year.D-Day veteran Jake Larson, now 102, has made multiple return trips and has become a star as \"Papa Jake\" on TikTok, with 1.2 million followers.

This rule has been a constant frustration for travellers, forcing them to pack small containers and separate liquids from other hand luggage at security.Thanks to new 3D CT scanners, airport security staff can now conduct far more thorough inspections without needing liquids to be separated or restricted to small bottles. This means passengers can carry up to 2 litres of liquid in hand luggage, even in containers larger than 100ml.Which Airports Have Upgraded?By June 2025, several UK airports have completed the necessary technology installation. These include:BirminghamBristolEdinburghGatwickLeeds BradfordLondon CityLutonNewcastleSouthendTeessideAt these airports, travellers can:Pack full-size toiletries without fearKeep laptops and tablets inside hand luggage when passing securityThe Civil Aviation Authority revealed that outdated liquid and electronics rules caused up to 35% of security delays in 2024, so this upgrade promises faster queues and smoother journeys.Heathrow, Manchester and Stansted Lag BehindSome of the UK's busiest airports, including Heathrow, Manchester and Stansted are still in the process of upgrading their systems. Until they complete installation, they enforce:The old 100ml liquid limitLiquids packed in clear resealable bagsRemoval of laptops and tablets at securityDelays in upgrades have been blamed on supply chain issues and construction setbacks. The government has warned that airports not meeting the deadline may face financial penalties later this year.What Travellers Should Do Before FlyingBecause rules vary by airport, passengers should take care when packing:Check your departure airport's security rules before you packIf unsure, use 100ml containers to avoid confiscationArrive at the airport early, especially if flying from a non-upgraded hubVerify liquid restrictions for your return flight, as overseas rules may differAngela, a traveller from London City, said: 'I packed my usual shampoo thinking the new rules applied everywhere. I had to bin it at Madrid airport on my way back.'And just because your hair gel made it out of Birmingham doesn't mean it'll survive Barcelona.Investment and Progress in the RolloutThe government has invested £425 million ($540 million) in upgrading UK airports with the latest screening technology. Despite this, by early 2025, only 62% of airports had completed the installation.Countries such as Ireland and Finland have already completed nationwide rollouts, putting the UK somewhat behind in this area.A More Relaxed Future for FlyersOnce fully implemented, the new liquid rules will significantly reduce stress and queues at security checkpoints. Passengers will no longer have to juggle multiple plastic bags or worry about losing toiletries.However, with inconsistent implementation across UK airports, confusion remains a real possibility.

Trump frequently uses Biden as a political foil and has sought to undo a number of policies from his predecessor\\'s administration since he returned to office. The announcement Wednesday directs the White House counsel and Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate whether anyone \"conspired to deceive the public about Biden\\'s mental state and unconstitutionally exercise the authorities and responsibilities of the President.\" It is an escalation of an issue that Trump and his allies have frequently raised, possibly paving the way for Republicans to argue that many of Biden’s actions as president were invalid.\"This conspiracy marks one of the most dangerous and concerning scandals in American history,\" Trump wrote in a memo. \"The American public was purposefully shielded from discovering who wielded the executive power, all while Biden’s signature was deployed across thousands of documents to effect radical policy shifts.\"Trump has acknowledged using the autopen himself in office. In March, he said he turned to it “only for very unimportant papers,” such as responses to letters.“But to use them for — for what they’ve used them for is terrible,” he added, referring to the Biden administration. In Wednesday\\'s memo, Trump further contended that if Biden’s aides “secretly” used the pen to conceal his alleged decline while they were taking executive actions in his stead, “that would constitute an unconstitutional wielding of the power of the Presidency, a circumstance that would have implications for the legality and validity of numerous executive actions undertaken in Biden’s name.”Biden defended his record in a statement Wednesday, arguing that the probe was a “distraction” from Trump and Republican lawmakers.“Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn’t is ridiculous and false,” Biden said. Trump has previously claimed without evidence that Biden used an autopen to sign pre-emptive pardons for the members of Congress who investigated the events surrounding the Jan. 6, 2021, attack at the U.S. Capitol, rendering them “void.”Autopens have long been a mechanical tool to reproduce signatures in the White House, with Barack Obama being the first president to use it to sign legislation, according to The Associated Press. Previous administrations have pointed to a 2005 Office of Legal Counsel memo stating that the president “need not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill he approves and decides to sign in order for the bill to become law.” Biden has frequently defended himself against claims about his mental fitness and memory.Former special counsel Robert Hur said in a report last year that Biden would probably present to a jury as a \"sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory\" in explaining his decision not to prosecute Biden after an investigation of his handling of classified documents.Biden rejected Hur\\'s claims about his memory shortly after the report was released last year, saying, \"My memory’s fine.\"In an interview with ABC’s “The View” in May, Biden again denied having suffered from mental decline when he was president.“They are wrong,” he said of the allegations.House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., is also investigating Biden and has asked several former White House aides to appear for transcribed interviews.Elyse Perlmutter-GumbinerElyse Perlmutter-Gumbiner is the coordinating producer for the NBC News White House unit.Zoë RichardsZoë Richards is a politics reporter for NBC News.Kelly O\\'Donnell contributed.', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Trump investigates Biden's alleged autopen misuse\\nENTITIES: Donald Trump, Joe Biden, Pam Bondi, Robert Hur, James Comer\\nEVENT: Trump orders investigation into Biden's alleged autopen use to conceal cognitive decline and unconstitutionally wield presidential power, prompting Biden to defend his record and mental fitness.\\nCONTEXT: Trump escalates attacks on Biden's mental fitness, potentially invalidating past actions.\", 'createdAt': '2025-06-05T08:04:47.658Z'}, {'id': 104488, 'sourceId': 908, 'url': 'https://metro.co.uk/2025/06/05/favourite-places-eat-europe-arent-usual-tourist-traps-23267078/', 'title': \"Your favourite places to eat in Europe that aren't the usual tourist traps\", 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T06:00:00.000Z', 'content': 'Metro readers share their favourite off the beaten track food spots (Picture: Getty Images)\\nFor most of us, the holiday trifecta is thus: sun, sea, and seriously good food.\\nWhether it’s tapas in Spain, pizza in Italy, or schnitzel in Germany, every country has its own unique flavour.\\nBut as popular destinations push back against tourists, there’s never been a better time to explore new culinary horizons.\\nAs we edge closer to peak summer season, we asked Metro readers to share their favourite lesser-known places to eat in Europe.

So, how do you approach your potential husband or wife-to-be, without putting your job on the line?\\nMetro spoke to career expert Lynn Burman at Clover HR, for her advice on how to navigate workplace crushes, while avoiding professional disaster.\\nStep 1: Weigh up the risks\\nBefore you send a flirty text or ask them out for drinks, take a moment to weigh up the potential consequences.\\n‘There was once a saying “don’t play with payroll” because of the risks associated with office romances,’ Lynn says.\\n‘If things don’t go well there’s a strong likelihood of having to see them every day. It will be uncomfortable and office gossip is highly likely, putting your professional reputation on the line.\\n‘Consider if you’re willing to risk your job or career progression for a crush, especially if your company discourages workplace relationships.’\\nSign up to The Hook-Up, Metro's sex and dating newsletter\\nLove reading juicy stories like this?

We can't wait for you to join us!\\nStep 2: Ask yourself some tricky questions\\nSo you’ve decided they could be The One for you. Now, Lynn advises some serious reflection. Ask yourself these questions, and be 100% honest with your answers:\\nAm I really interested in this person, or is it just the setting?\\nAm I prepared for colleagues to find out and possibly gossip about me?\\nIs it worth putting my career goals at risk?\\nWhat if my manager asks me about it directly? What should I say?\\nDoes my workplace have a policy about work relationships that I should look at?\\nCan I carry on as normal if a relationship begins? Or could it be all-consuming?\\nKeep your interactions at work limited (Picture: Getty Images)\\nStep 3: Don’t use your work devices\\nTempted to send a flirty message over Teams? You might want to think again.\\n‘Keep any approaches face-to-face or by phone, and any emails should be sent to and from personal email addresses,’ Lynn says.\\n‘Send any messages strictly during out-of-office hours, and on your personal devices.’\\nStep 4: Tell your boss\\n‘Some companies have relationship policies and ask for full disclosure while in the relationship in order to ensure confidentiality clauses are not at risk,’ Lynn says. ‘So make sure you read these thoroughly.’\\nEven if you don’t strictly have to tell your boss that you’re embarking on a blossoming romance, it’s a good idea to do so.\\n‘It’s always worth being transparent with your manager,’ she adds.\\nStep 5: Set boundaries\\nIt’s important to lay some ground rules with your new beau, in order to protect your career.\\nLynn says: ‘Keep all interactions professional and avoid discussing personal matters at work.’\\nWhile you might not be able to avoid working closely together, try to keep your relationship out of it.\\n‘If you happen to be collaborating in the same team or on the same project, don’t let your feelings influence your work decisions or performance.’\\nWhat happens if the relationship turns sour?\\nNot every work fling works out – some inevitably end, and not always in a good way.\\n‘If a breakup is needed, do it outside of work to keep things private and professional and perhaps even book some time off if needed to process thoughts and emotions,’ Lynn says.\\n‘Stay civil and professional at all times, even if it’s awkward. And, if things become too uncomfortable, consider whether a change in team or role is necessary for your well-being and long-term goals.’\\nDo you have a story to share?\\nGet in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.\\nArrow\\nMORE: I make an extra £500 a month by selling old clothes — this is my recipe for success\\nArrow\\nMORE: Like JoJo Siwa, I dated a man after women — we’re not ‘fake lesbians’\\nArrow\\nMORE: My dying mother revealed a life-changing secret — I wish she’d kept it to herself\\nThe Slice\\nYour free newsletter guide to the best London has on offer, from drinks deals to restaurant reviews.\", 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Navigating workplace crushes: Tips for avoiding disaster\\nENTITIES: Lynn Burman, Clover HR\\nEVENT: Career expert Lynn Burman provides five tips for approaching a work crush without jeopardizing one's job, including weighing risks, avoiding work devices, and setting boundaries.\\nCONTEXT: Navigating workplace romances requires careful consideration to avoid professional repercussions.\", 'createdAt': '2025-06-05T08:04:47.658Z'}, {'id': 104728, 'sourceId': 12314, 'url': 'https://www.foxnews.com/us/illegal-immigrant-convicted-100-mph-dui-crash-killed-washington-state-trooper', 'title': 'Illegal immigrant convicted in 100 mph DUI crash that killed Washington state trooper', 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T02:38:41.000Z', 'content': \"NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!\\nJurors in Washington state delivered a guilty verdict against an illegal immigrant accused of killing a state trooper last year.\\xa0Raul Benitez-Santana, 33, was found guilty of vehicular assault and vehicular homicide in connection with the death of Washington State Patrol Trooper Christopher Gadd.Gadd, 27, was killed when his cruiser was hit by a speeding car in March 2024 at more than 100 mph.\\xa0TEEN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT WHO KILLED WOMAN IN COLORADO CRASH GETS PROBATION, THEN IS ARRESTED BY ICE WITH FAMILY Raul Benitez Santana was convicted of killing a Washington State Patrol officer after crashing his car into a patrol vehicle.

The 50-year-old says she never intended to hurt them and it was a tragic accident.Prosecutors on Thursday suggested photos found on her phone showing wild fungi being weighed depict her measuring the amount required to kill her guests.Ms Patterson told the court she had likely taken the photos in question but said she didn\\'t believe the mushrooms in them were death caps.Ms Patterson\\'s in-laws, Don and Gail Patterson, both 70, along with Gail\\'s sister Heather Wilkinson, 66, all fell ill and died days after the lunch. Heather\\'s husband, local pastor Ian Wilkinson, was also hospitalised but recovered after coming out of a weeks-long induced coma.The high-profile trial, which started almost six weeks ago, has already heard from more than 50 prosecution witnesses. Ms Patterson became the first defence witness to take the stand on Monday afternoon.Under cross-examination from the lead prosecutor, Ms Patterson admitted she had foraged for wild mushrooms in the three months before the July lunch, despite telling police and a health official that she hadn\\'t. The court was also shown images, taken in late April 2023 and recovered from Ms Patterson\\'s phone, which depicted mushrooms being weighed.Ms Patterson previously admitted she had repeatedly deleted electronic data in the days following the lunch because she feared that if officers found such pictures they would blame her for the guests\\' deaths.Pointing to earlier evidence from a fungi expert who said the mushrooms in the images were \"highly consistent\" with death caps, Dr Rogers alleged Ms Patterson had knowingly foraged them days before.She had seen a post on iNaturalist - a website for logging plant and animal sightings - and travelled to the Loch area ten days later on 28 April to pick the toxic fungi, Dr Rogers alleged.Ms Patterson said she couldn\\'t recall if she went to the town that day, but denied she went there to find death cap mushrooms or that she had seen the iNaturalist post.\"I suggest that you were weighing these mushrooms so that you could calculate the weight required for... a fatal dose,\" Dr Rogers put to her.\"Disagree,\" Ms Patterson replied.The mother-of-two also spoke about putting powdered dried mushrooms into a range of foods like spaghetti, brownies and stew, which prosecutors allege was practice for the fatal lunch. Ms Patterson said this was not true, but rather an attempt to get \"extra vegetables into my kids\\' bodies\".Prosecutors repeatedly asked her, with different wording each time, whether she had knowingly used the same food dehydrator to prepare death cap mushrooms for the lunch.CCTV played at the trial shows Ms Patterson disposing of the appliance at a local dump.\"That\\'s why you rushed out, the day after your release from [hospital], to get rid of the evidence,\" Dr Rogers said.\"No,\" replied Ms Patterson.Earlier, Ms Patterson\\'s barrister asked her why she repeatedly lied to police about foraging mushrooms and having a food dehydrator.\"It was this stupid knee-jerk reaction to dig deeper and keep lying,\" she told the court. \"I was just scared, but I shouldn\\'t have done it.\"Ms Patterson also repeated her claim that she never intentionally put the poisonous fungi in the meal.She said the mushrooms used in the beef Wellington may have accidentally included dried, foraged varieties that were kept in a container with store-bought ones.Ms Patterson was also quizzed on evidence given by other witnesses that she had asked her guests to come to the lunch to discuss health issues, namely a cancer diagnosis. She said she didn\\'t outright say she had cancer, but still shouldn\\'t have misled her relatives, saying she\\'d done so partly because their concern made her feel loved.\"I suggest that you never thought you would have to account for this lie about having cancer because you thought the lunch guests would die,\" Dr Rogers said. \"Your lie would never be found out.\"\"That\\'s not true,\" Ms Patterson said.She will resume being cross examined on Friday.', 'location': 'AUS', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Woman Accused of Mushroom Poisoning Relatives\\nENTITIES: Erin Patterson, Don Patterson, Gail Patterson, Heather Wilkinson, Ian Wilkinson\\nEVENT: Erin Patterson is accused of murdering three relatives and attempting to murder another by poisoning them with death cap mushrooms in a beef Wellington dish.

ongoing falling revenues in the UK.The footwear group reported pre-tax profits of £8.8 million for the year to March 30, down from £93 million the previous year, after seeing sales fall 10%.On an underlying basis, pre-tax profits slumped to £34.1 million from £97.2 million.The group said sales to consumers in the US returned to growth in the second half of the year and have continued to increase, but revealed UK revenues have remained lower since the year-end “due to a challenging market”.It added that unfavourable foreign exchange rates would see it take a hit to group sales and profits of around £18 million and £3 million respectively in 2025-26.Despite this, Dr Martens said it expects underlying profits to rise “significantly” over the financial year ahead, with analysts expecting a jump to between £54 million and £74 million.It flagged uncertainty over the impact of higher tariffs, but said it was holding off from price hikes for the the remainder of 2025.Its stock is already in the US market for the spring/summer season and either there or on its way for the autumn/winter.“We do however recognise that there is continued macroeconomic uncertainty and the full outcome of tariffs is still unknown, and we will monitor this closely through the year and take action as appropriate,” the group said.The Northamptonshire-based company outlined new plans for growth alongside its results, with aims to attract new shoppers and hold off from discounts in EMEA and the Americas.Annual figures showed sales sales dropped 11.4% over the year, although retail lifted 1% in the final six months.In the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region, sales fell 11%, with direct-to-consumer difficulty amid a highly promotional market – particularly in the UK.The company, whose yellow-stitched boots have been a retro mainstay for decades, has been in the doldrums in recent years, with declining revenues exacerbated by the cost-of-living crisis.It listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2021, and has since issued a slew of profit warnings and replaced its chief executive.Many of Dr Martens’ recent problems have come from steep declines in sales in the US, but new chief executive Ije Nwokorie said the group had stabilised in the past year.He said: “Our single focus in 2024-25 was to bring stability back to Dr Martens.“We have achieved this by returning our direct-to-consumer channel in the Americas back to growth, resetting our marketing approach to focus relentlessly on our products, delivering cost savings and significantly strengthening our balance sheet.”Mr Nwokorie, previously the firm’s head of marketing before taking on the top job from Kenny Wilson on January 6, said: “I am laser-focused on day-to-day execution, managing costs and

liquidity in the shares.Co-founder and chief executive Kristo Käärmann said: “We believe the addition of a primary US listing with a secondary UK listing would help us drive greater awareness of Wise in the US, the biggest market opportunity in the world for our products today.“Additionally, it would enable more investors to benefit from the value we create and our shares would be more liquid, giving owners more flexibility and opportunity.”The announcement was made alongside annual results, which showed that reported profit before tax rose by 17% to £565 million.

Trump\\'s successor Joe Biden repealed the order in 2021.But this time around it\\'s a savvier version, our North America correspondent Jake Kwon writes.Last time a crucial question in the legal battle over the bill was whether it discriminated against travellers based on their religion.This time, the order doesn\\'t just target majority Muslim nations. Trump says the rationale for the countries chosen is based on visa overstay rates or political instability.There are some similarities in the nations chosen. Iran, Libya and Somalia are among those featuring on both lists.However there is a difference in how long the policy is due to last. Last time it was only 90 to 120 days, but today\\'s has no end date.\\nTrump on banned countries: \\'We don\\'t want them\\'published at 07:14 British Summer Time07:14 BSTpublished at 06:1406:14\\nImage source, ReutersLet\\'s bring you more of what the US president had to say as he announced the travel ban in a video on his Truth Social platform.Donald Trump said a recent attack in Boulder, Colorado - where 12 people were injured when a man attacked a group gathering in support of Israeli hostages - \"underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted as well as those who come here as temporary visitors and overstay their visas\".\"We don\\'t want them,\" Trump said, adding that he believes the US can\\'t have \"open migration from any country where we cannot safely and reliably vet and screen those who seek to enter\".The strength of these new restrictions applied depends on the \"severity of the threat posed,\" Trump continued, adding that the list of countries under the ban is \"subject to revision\" if improvements are made.\\nWhat you need to know about Trump\\'s travel banpublished at 06:59 British Summer Time06:59 BSTpublished at 05:5905:59\\nUS President Donald Trump signed a travel ban order on Wednesday night, barring entry to the US for citizens from a number of countries across the world. Here\\'s what you need to know:Who will be banned from entering the US?From 9 June, citizens from 12 countries - Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen - will be banned from travelling to the US.Those from another seven countries - Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela - will be subject to a partial ban.Is anyone exempt?There are a few exemptions to this new policy - including athletes travelling for major sporting events, some dual nationals and Afghan nationals holding Special Immigrant Visas.The order also says the secretary of state may grant exemptions on a \"case-by-case\" basis.What has Trump said?The US can\\'t have \"open migration from any country where we cannot safely and reliably vet and screen those who seek to enter\", the US president said in a video announcing the ban.\\nMyanmar ban will largely affect people fighting for democracypublished at 06:45 British Summer Time06:45 BSTpublished at 05:4505:45Jonathan HeadSouth East Asia Correspondent\\nImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Many Burmese refugees hope to find a home in the USWhen we look at the nationalities of people who have carried out attacks on the United States, we\\'ll see that many of them are from countries friendly to the US, which have not been subject to a travel ban in this case.Trump says the countries on his list do not have capacity to vet their own citizens. Myanmar is in a state of collapse, so that\\'s quite true. But there hasn\\'t been any record of anyone from the country ever carrying out any kind of attack on the US. It simply isn\\'t a credible threat.In the end, this travel ban applies to a country where huge numbers of its citizens have fled and are living in exile - many of them hoping to find a home in the US. There are already nearly 250,000 Burmese living in the US, and many of them are refugees with a very well-founded fear of persecution. The worst perpetrators of human rights abuses in Myanmar are mostly already banned from travelling to the US. Extending the ban to all citizens will mostly affect those fighting against the military for the restoration of democracy. These include activists living in precarious situations in neighbouring countries where they don\\'t have status - many of them hoping at some point to get to the US.So this is a pretty baffling decision.\\nHaitians will see this as US kicking a nation when it\\'s downpublished at 06:24 British Summer Time06:24 BSTpublished at 05:2405:24Will GrantMexico, Central America and Cuba correspondent\\nFrom the perspective of many Haitians, there will be indignation at this travel ban, coming as it does with the country in the grip of its biggest security crisis in living memory. Under the Biden administration and then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken, there was a tacit recognition that Washington had played a crucial role in hand-picking the current leadership in Haiti and was at least partly responsible for transnational effort to stop Haiti becoming a failed state. That ensured that Haitians in the United States under Temporary Protected Status (TPS) were in no danger of being deported to a nation on its knees. As such, to see Haiti on the travel ban list will be galling for the lucky few with the relevant papers to reach the US. It will feel to many like the definition of kicking a nation when it\\'s down, by one of its supposedly closest partners.\\nWhy these countries?published at 06:07 British Summer Time06:07 BSTpublished at 05:0705:07Kwasi Gyamfi AsieduUS reporter\\nTrump says his travel ban order is partially in response to threats of terrorism.But besides Iran, none of the 12 countries hit by the ban are named on the US government\\'s State Sponsors of Terrorism list.Trump also said some of the countries, such as Libya and Sudan, were put on the list because of the \"competence of the central authority for issuance of passports\". Many of the countries have ongoing armed conflicts. Others were on the list because their governments don\\'t give access to criminal records, he said.The order also says some of the countries have been put on the list because of difficulties US officials have had deporting citizens from those countries back home. Generally, people scheduled to be deported require travel documents from their home countries.With regards to the partial ban on tourists, business travellers and students from seven other countries, Trump said it was because of a high rate of visa overstays by its citizens.As we have reported, Egypt is not on the list of banned countries - despite Trump citing the recent attack in Colorado by an Egyptian national when announcing the travel ban.\\nHuman rights groups slam \\'downright cruel\\' banpublished at 05:39 British Summer Time05:39 BSTpublished at 04:3904:39\\nImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, During President Trump\\'s first term there were many protests against his original travel banHuman rights groups have criticsed the ban, with Amnesty International USA describing it as \"discriminatory, racist, and downright cruel\".\"By targeting people based on their nationality, this ban only spreads disinformation and hate,\" it wrote in a post on social media site X.Human Rights First, also based in the US, condemned it as \"yet another anti-immigrant and punitive action, external taken by President Trump\". “The ban will harm refugees, asylum seekers, and other vulnerable populations, including many who have been waiting to reunite with loved ones in our country,\" said the organisation\\'s Senior Director of Refugee Advocacy Robyn Barnard in a statement.\"Bans do nothing to make our country secure, but rather undermine our national security and arbitrarily target those most in need of protection,\" he said.\\nOlympics and World Cup won\\'t be affected by banpublished at 05:11 British Summer Time05:11 BSTpublished at 04:1104:11\\nImage source, ReutersSeveral major sporting events are due to be held in the US over the next few years.These include the 2026 World Cup - jointly hosted by Canada, Mexico and the US - and the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. As it stands, though, the travel ban will seemingly not affect athletes from prohibited countries competing.The almost 4,500 word long proclamation contains a single line which outlines the exemption: \"any athlete or member of an athletic team, including coaches, persons performing a necessary support role, and immediate relatives, traveling for the World Cup, Olympics, or other major sporting event as determined by the Secretary of State\".\\nTravel, Biden and Harvard: Trump\\'s orders at a glancepublished at 04:50 British Summer Time04:50 BSTpublished at 03:5003:50\\nA few hours ago, US President Donald Trump signed a proclamation banning citizens of a dozen countries from travelling to the US.If you\\'re just joining us, here\\'s what to know:\\nStarting on Monday, 9 June, citizens from 12 countries are set to be banned from travelling to the US: Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen\\nAnother seven countries have come under a partial ban: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela\\nIn a video message, Trump cited the recent attack in Colorado as an example of foreign nationals entering the US without being \"properly vetted\". The alleged attacker was an Egyptian national - but Egypt has been left out of the ban\\nThe travel ban has been met with dismay in the targeted countries. Venezuela has described the Trump administration as \"supremacists who think they own the world\", while Somalia has pledged to \"engage in dialogue to address the concerns raised\"\\nDespite its sweeping nature, the travel ban contains exemptions to some, such as immigrants who are \"ethnic and religious minorities facing persecution in Iran\" and athletes travelling for major sporting events\\nAnd this is not the only big announcement from the White House today: Trump has also signed an executive order to restrict foreign student visas at Harvard University, and ordered an inquiry into what he says was a \"conspiracy\" to cover up former President Joe Biden\\'s cognitive health decline\\nWe\\'ll continue to bring you the latest updates as we get them. Please stay with us.\\nA curious omission from Trump\\'s list of travel banspublished at 04:27 British Summer Time04:27 BSTpublished at 03:2703:27Koh EweLive page reporter\\nImage source, Getty ImagesAs we have reported, Egypt is not on the list of banned countries - despite Trump citing the recent attack in Colorado by an Egyptian national when announcing the travel ban.There are clues as to why that is the case.The US and Egypt have a strong defence alliance - a partnership that the US calls a \"pillar for regional stability\". Egypt is one of the biggest beneficiaries of US economic and military aid in the Middle East, receiving a total of $1.4bn from US agencies in 2023.During his first term, Trump built close ties with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. The Egyptian leader, who has ruled the country with an iron first for the past decade, has been described by Trump as his \"favourite dictator\".However, bilateral ties in Trump\\'s second term have been complicated by Israel\\'s war in Gaza. Trump\\'s suggestions for displaced Palestinians to be relocated to Egypt has been rejected by Cairo, which is trying to lead efforts to reconstruct a war-ravaged Gaza.\\nThis is a savvier version of Trump\\'s 2017 travel ban - and it\\'s designed to lastpublished at 04:11 British Summer Time04:11 BSTpublished at 03:1103:11Jake KwonNorth America Correspondent\\nPresident Trump is resurrecting\\nhis earlier travel ban - but this time, with more calculation.His first attempt targeted seven Muslim-majority\\ncountries. It was immediately challenged in courts across the US. Its opponents\\nargued the ban was unconstitutional and\\nillegal because it discriminated against travellers based on their religion.The White House amended the travel\\nban twice to dispel the air of religious discrimination, which eventually won\\nit the Supreme Court\\'s approval. This time, Trump has learned his lesson.His administration reinstated a version of the order\\nsimilar to the one that was upheld by the Supreme Court. This version does not\\ntarget Muslim nations. Its stated rationale for the selection of countries is visa overstay\\nrates or political instability in the target country.And unlike the earlier version,\\nwhich was to last for only 90 to 120 days, today\\'s order has no end date. It\\nmerely calls for a periodic review.\\nHarvard calls Trump ban on new foreign students \\'retaliatory\\'published at 03:46 British Summer Time03:46 BSTpublished at 02:4602:46\\nHarvard University has denounced Trump\\'s executive order, which now bans it from bringing in new foreign students for six months.\"This is yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard\\'s First Amendment rights,\" said a Harvard spokesman. \"Harvard will continue to protect its international students.\"Trump signed an order to restrict foreign student visas at Harvard - amid an escalating battle between universities and the US president - along with his recently announced travel ban.\"President Trump wants our institutions to have foreign students, but believes that the foreign students should be people that can love our country,\" the White House said in a fact sheet.It alleged Harvard was the top overseas academic institution for Chinese Communist Party officials, noting that President Xi Jinping’s daughter had studied there in the 2010s.According to the White House, Harvard had a history of foreign ties with potential security implications, failed to supply sufficient information about students\\' illegal activities; and had extensive contacts with foreign adversaries such as China. It also said that many agitators behind antisemitic incidents were foreign students.\\nFor Trump, this is a campaign promise fulfilledpublished at 03:30 British Summer Time03:30 BSTpublished at 02:3002:30Bernd Debusmann JrReporting from Washington\\nFor those who have been watching Trump closely over the last year, today\\'s announcement comes as no surprise.Reinstating a travel ban - a key part of his first administration - contributed to Trump\\'s successful 2024 campaign. Last July, for example, Trump told rallygoers in Minnesota he would \"restore the travel ban, suspend refugee admissions, stop the resettlement and keep the terrorists the hell out of our country.\"As someone who previously focused on reporting about the US-Mexico border and immigration issues, I find it notable that the partial travel bans include citizens of Cuba and Venezuela, two of the countries that made up the bulk of arrivals at the border during Biden\\'s term. Since returning to office, Trump\\'s team has often used the phrase \"promises made, promises kept\" - they are likely to use it again in the coming days.\\nReaction from affected countries is starting to come throughpublished at 03:11 British Summer Time03:11 BSTpublished at 02:1102:11\\nImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Venezuela\\'s Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello reacted angrily to the announcementWe\\'re starting to get reaction from some of the countries mentioned in Trump\\'s latest travel ban.Venezuela is one of seven countries affected by partial restrictions.

Meanwhile, Somalia - now hit with a full travel ban - has responded by immediately promising to work with the US to address security issues.

Most Indians revere him as the \"father of the nation\".Over the years, several paintings, drawings and sketches of him have circulated around the world. The auction house Bonhams says the painting, made by British artist Clare Leighton, is \"thought to be the only oil portrait that Gandhi actually sat for\".The portrait was made when Gandhi went to London in 1931 for the second Round Table conference, held to discuss constitutional reforms for India and address its demands for self-governance. It will be auctioned in the second week of July at Bonhams. \"This is a painting of unique historic and cultural significance. It would be great if it could be seen and appreciated more widely, whether in India or elsewhere,\" Caspar Leighton, a great nephew of the artist, told the BBC.According to Bonhams, Clare Leighton \"was one of the very few artists admitted to his office and was given the opportunity to sit with on multiple occasions to sketch and paint his likeness\".The works remained in the artist\\'s collection until her death in 1989 in the US, after which it was passed down through her family.She was introduced to Gandhi through her partner and British political journalist, Henry Noel Brailsford, who was a strong supporter of India\\'s independence movement.Universal Images Group via Getty ImagesMahatma Gandhi visited London in 1931 to attend the second Round Table ConferenceIn November 1931, Leighton showcased her portraits of Gandhi at an exhibition at the Albany Galleries in London. Though Gandhi did not attend the opening event, several representatives from the Indian delegation of the second Round Table were present. Among them was Sarojini Naidu, also an eminent Indian independence leader, who was one of the key advisors to Gandhi at the meeting. The exhibition included a charcoal sketch of Gandhi, asleep in his office, along with the oil portrait that is now set to be auctioned. About the painting of Gandhi, British Journalist Winifred Holtby wrote: \"The little man squats bare-headed, in his blanket, one finger raised, as it often is to emphasise a point, his mouth parted for a word that is almost a smile\".The following month, Gandhi\\'s personal secretary Mahadev Desai wrote to Leighton, saying, \"many of my friends who saw it [the oil portrait] in the Albany Gallery said to me that it was a good likeness\".BonhamsA label attached to the back of the painting states that it was restored in 1974There doesn\\'t seem to be any public record of the oil portrait being displayed elsewhere until 1978, when the Boston Public Library organised an exhibition of Leighton\\'s works.However, according to the artist\\'s family, the portrait was thought to have been on display in the 1970s in the US, where it was allegedly damaged in a knife attack. A label attached to the backing board of the portrait says it was restored by the Lyman Allyn Museum Conservation Laboratory in Connecticut in 1974.The details of the alleged attack are not clear - according to Bonhams, it was carried out by a right-wing Hindu activist. Hindu hardliners in India accuse Gandhi of having betrayed Hindus by being too pro-Muslim, and blame him for the division of India and the bloodshed that marked Partition, which saw India and Pakistan created after independence in 1947.He was shot dead on 30 January 1948 at a prayer meeting by Nathuram Godse, an activist with nationalist right-wing groups.', 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Gandhi's rare oil portrait to be auctioned\\nENTITIES: Mahatma Gandhi, Clare Leighton, Bonhams, India, UK\\nEVENT: An oil portrait of Mahatma Gandhi, painted in 1931 by British artist Clare Leighton, will be auctioned in London.

murder trial at Latrobe Valley Magistrates\\' Court in Morwell, Victoria.\\n06:25Patterson denied being upset with Simon over tax return status changeDr Rogers asked Patterson about her marriage with Simon and the issues which arose in late-2022 after her estranged husband listed himself as single on a tax return.Patterson denied she was \\'upset\\' about the issue and she didn\\'t believe Simon offered to change his status on the tax return.Dr Rogers said in Simon\\'s evidence, he said there was a \\'substantial change\\' in the relationship.Patterson said she hoped if Don and Gail knew about Simon he might change his behaviour.More text messages between Erin and Don regarding her issues with Simon were read to the court.Some of the issues pertained to Simon paying school fees.Patterson said she was encouraging Don and Gail to get Simon to \\'do the right thing by his children\\'.\\'I\\'m finding it hard to explain what I meant by that,\\' Patterson said.The trial has concluded for the day and Daily Mail Australia\\'s coverage will resume at 8am local time on Friday.06:04Patterson \\'lied because she thought all her lunch guests would die\\', prosecution allegesDr Rogers has suggested Patterson lied about not telling her lunch guests she had cancer because she thought they were all going to die.The prosecutor suggested Patterson\\'s claim to various people that she had cancer was \\'deliberately false\\'.\\'I didn\\'t make that claim,\\' Patterson said.Dr Rogers said Patterson made the cancer claim to get them to the lunch.\\'That\\'s incorrect,\\' Patterson said.Dr Rogers suggested it was a \\'good reason to get them to lunch because [it was] so out of the ordinary\\'.\\'I disagree,\\' Patterson said.Patterson admitted it \\'wasn\\'t out of the ordinary to have people over for lunch\\'.\\'I suggest that you never thought you would have to account for this lie of having cancer, because you thought that the lunch guests would die and your lie would never be found out,\\' Dr Rogers said.\\'No,\\' Patterson responded.05:56Patterson claims child protection officer\\'s evidence was \\'wrong\\'Dr Rogers asked Patterson if she remembers telling child protection officer Katrina Cripps (pictured) on August 1 that she said she invited Don, Gail, Ian and Heather to lunch to discuss a medical issue.\\'I wouldn\\'t have put it like that because that wasn\\'t the reason I invited people,\\' she said.Patterson then said Ms Cripps’ evidence was \\'wrong\\'.Dr Rogers reminded Patterson of Ms Cripps\\' evidence about when she asked the child protection officer for advice on how to approach this issue with the kids.Patterson said her memory of the conversation was \\'clearly different\\'.05:53Patterson grilled over claims she told guests about \\'chemo\\'Dr Rogers has continued pressing Patterson on what she said about her fictitious cancer diagnosis.\\'Do you agree, you told the lunch guests that you had upcoming treatment for cancer?\\' Dr Rogers said.\\'I can\\'t remember the exact words… I was really trying to communicate I might be needing some treatment,\\' Patterson replied.\\'You wanted your lunch guests to believe you may be having treatment,\\' Dr Rogers said.\\'I agree with that,\\' Patterson said.Patterson again disagreed she told her guest she had cancer.Dr Rogers suggested she told her guests she had ovarian cancer and required treatment including chemotherapy.\\'I don\\'t think I put it like that precisely, I don\\'t remember saying I had a diagnosis…,\\' Patterson said.\\'There was nothing to tell the kids and I had no intention of telling the kids.\\'Dr Rogers brought up the evidence where Simon said he was made aware Patterson said she required \\'chemo\\'.05:31Patterson denies telling lunch guests she had cancerDr Rogers has insisted Patterson told her lunch guests she had cancer but the accused killer denied those claims.Patterson claimed she told guests she didn\\'t want to tell the kids about her illness and she didn\\'t ask for advice on how to tell the kids.\\'I did not,\\' Patterson said when asked if she told her guests she had cancer.Dr Rogers reminded Patterson that Ian Wilkinson (pictured) had talked about a diagnostic test.\\'I think I talked about that I\\'d been undergoing some testing,\\' she said.Dr Rogers said when Mr Wilkinson gave evidence earlier on in the trial, he had said Patterson said she had a spot on a scan that was a tumour.\\'I don\\'t believe I said that, I don\\'t think so no,\\' Patterson said.Dr Rogers insisted Patterson said she had cancer.\\'I disagree,\\' Patterson responded.05:28Prosecution alleges Patterson lied about cancer to ensure Simon attended lunchDr Rogers has suggested Patterson told Gail she needed a biopsy in a bid to ensure Simon came to the July 29 lunch.Patterson is reminded of a message she sent to Gail in which she said she took her daughter to see The Little Mermaid.Patterson also communicated to Gail she had to have a needle biopsy and an MRI.The jury heard Patterson admitted it was a lie.\\'I didn\\'t have an appointment and I didn\\'t have a needle biopsy or a lump,\\' she said.Dr Rogers asked Patterson if she expected Gail to tell Simon about her biopsy stuff.\\'I don\\'t think I wished that, no,\\' Patterson said.Dr Rogers suggested Patterson hoped Gail would tell Simon about the biopsy so he would not decline any future lunch invites.\\'The answer to that is no because I wouldn\\'t expect her to tell him any of that,’ she said.05:14Prosecution claim Patterson wanted to \\'plant a seed\\' of serious health concerns Patterson has admitted lying about a story she concocted that she had to go to hospital to have a lump on her elbow checked out.Dr Rogers suggested Patterson had no appointment at St Vincent\\'s Hospital and no appointment for a needle biopsy.Patterson agreed she had no medical issues to discuss with Gail at the lunch.\\'I didn\\'t have a legitimate medical reason, so, that\\'s true,\\' Patterson said.\\'You had nothing to tell the kids about medical issues,\\' Dr Rogers asked.\\'No,\\' Patterson said.Dr Rogers previously suggested Patterson told Gail about the elbow lump to \\'plant a seed of a serious health issue\\'.\\'No, I don\\'t think that\\'s right, no,\\' Patterson said.\\'Why did you say it?\\' Dr Rogers asked.\\'So I think I gave this in evidence a couple days ago, I initially thought I had an issue with my elbow…\\' Patterson said.\\'I had told Don and Gail what I was worried about, it started to resolve.\\'I probably whinged a bit too much about it to Don and Gail and felt a bit embarrassed about it, and they made me feel loved and cared for in the way they asked about my health and I didn\\'t want that to stop so I just kept going.\\'05:05Prosecution allege Patterson looked up cancer information \\'to lie\\'Dr Rogers has suggested Patterson made internet searches for information that would allow her to \\'tell a more convincing lie about having cancer\\'.The prosecutor used evidence from Victoria Police Cybercrime investigator Shamen Fox-Henry (pictured).The court heard Mr Fox-Henry allegedly found screenshots of cancer searches within a Google Photos app found on a device seized from Patterson\\'s phone.Patterson denied Dr Rogers\\' suggestion, telling the jury she feared she was sick.Dr Rogers repeated her suggestion Patterson was looking up information to lie.\\'I mean theoretically that\\'s true but that\\'s not what I did,\\' she said.Dr Rogers suggested she \\'did so to fool her in-laws\\'.\\'That was not why I did it...,\\' Patterson said.\\'I was concerned that I had ovarian cancer. I was concerned I had something wrong with my brain.\\'I didn\\'t give them any reason when I invited them. I just invited them.\\'04:56Patterson denies she mocked Don and GailDr Rogers said Patterson \\'expressed her true feelings\\' about Don and Gail (pictured) in Facebook messages.Dr Rogers asked Patterson about her use of \\'eye rolling emojis\\' and suggested she used those emojis in response to a family suggestion she \\'pray\\' to solve issues with Simon.The emoji was contained within the \\'I swear to f***ing god\\' message previously read out in court multiple times.Patterson told the jury the emoji looked to be a face with a straight line as a mouth and not rolling eyes.However, Patterson couldn\\'t explain what that emoji meant.\\'All I can say about it, is it\\'s a face with a straight line for a mouth, I don\\'t know what you\\'d call it,\\' she said.Dr Rogers suggested Patterson was mocking Don and Gail\\'s advice.\\'No, that\\'s not true,\\' she said.Dr Rogers also suggested Patterson had mocked their religion.\\'I wasn\\'t mocking, I was frustrated,\\' Patterson said.04:54Patterson denies telling Facebook friends she\\'s an atheist Dr Rogers asked Patterson if she was close to her Facebook friends.\\'Depends who we\\'re talking about,\\' Patterson said.Dr Rogers mentioned Patterson\\'s Facebook friend Christine Hunt, who she said she wasn\\'t close to.Patterson denied inviting Ms Hunt into a smaller chat group.Dr Rogers suggested Patterson \\'felt she could share things with them\\', including Ms Hunt.Patterson said she shared personal things but not in the group chat with Ms Hunt, and claimed she didn\\'t share anything after about 2021.Patterson also denied telling her friends she was an atheistDr Rogers said that\\'s an \\'untruth\\'.\\'No I didn\\'t say that,\\' Patterson said.\\'I didn\\'t post that in the Facebook group.\\'04:37Patterson declares her innocenceDr Rogers also suggested Patterson had lied about not \\'mushrooming\\' to Professor Stuart after knowing for 24 hours Don and Gail had been in hospital.\\'I don\\'t recall her asking me that, but if she did … I would have asked about what she meant by that (mushrooming) first,\\' she said.Dr Rogers then asked Patterson if she knows what mushrooming is.\\'It\\'s not a phrase that I would have used,\\' she said.\\'I would have used foraging if I meant picking.\\'Patterson said she found out Ian and Heather (pictured) were sick on Monday morning \\'indirectly\\'.The jury heard Dr Christopher Webster told her everyone else who ate the lunch had become unwell.Dr Rogers suggested Patterson deliberately used foraged mushrooms in the beef Wellington.\\'No that\\'s not true,\\' Patterson responded.\\'Death caps,\\' Dr Rogers said\\'I didn\\'t deliberately put death cap mushrooms in the meal,\\' she said.Patterson also said she doesn\\'t remember saying she panicked when guests became sick.\\'I don\\'t remember saying that,\\' she said.04:31Patterson grilled about when she knew her lunch guests were sickPatterson said Simon called her on July 30 at 11.08am and 2.23pm.Dr Rogers suggested Simon said he spoke to Patterson on the phone and told her that Don, Gail, Ian and Heather had been \\'crook\\' and were in hospital.\\'He only told me about Don and Gail on the Sunday,\\' she said.\\'You knew two lunch guests were sick on July 30 before you went to hospital the next day,\\' Dr Rogers asked.\\'Correct,\\' Patterson said.04:28Patterson \\'can\\'t remember\\' Health Department asking if she foraged mushroomsDr Rogers brought Patterson back to the evidence of Health Department officer Sally Ann Atkinson (pictured).Patterson agreed she spoke to Ms Atkinson on the phone on August 2 while she was with child protection officer Katrina Cripps.Ms Atkinson previously told the jury Patterson had confirmed she purchased the pre-sliced button mushrooms from Woolworths.\\'I did ask her if she had foraged for mushrooms and picked them herself,\\' Dr Rogers said Ms Atkinson had told the court.\\'I do recall that evidence, I don\\'t remember her asking me that question (about foraging) in the conversation and if I did… I would\\'ve said no,\\' Patterson responded.03:19Prosecutor suggests Patterson \\'lied\\' to doctorPatterson also couldn\\'t recall all of a conversation she had with Monash Health doctor Professor Rhonda Stuart a few days after the lunch.Dr Rogers suggested Professor Stuart said Patterson told her she\\'d only used Woolworths and Asian-type mushrooms in the dish.Professor Stuart said Patterson denied using any other mushrooms but accepted she\\'d been asked about \\'mushrooming\\'.Dr Rogers suggested Patterson said \\'no\\' to going mushrooming.\\'I don\\'t remember that conversation,\\' she saidDr Rogers suggested Patterson lied to Professor Stuart.\\'What I remember of all the questions being asked … was in the context of what was in the meal,\\' Patterson said.The trial has taken a break and will resume at 2.15pm.02:57Patterson denies telling online friends she was an atheist Dr Rogers suggested Patterson told her online friends about her personal life but said she denied telling them she was an atheist.Patterson also denied she told her friends she didn’t want her kids at a Christian school.Dr Rogers asked Patterson if she agrees she never told friends she\\'d foraged.\\'I don\\'t know if I did or I didn\\'t,\\' Patterson said.Dr Rogers suggested Patterson said \\'she didn\\'t\\'.\\'I don\\'t know if I told them or not,\\' she said.02:51Patterson intended to serve Simon beef WellingtonPatterson asked Dr Rogers to stop and move her microphone because she \\'lip reads a little bit\\' and she could not see the prosecutor\\'s face.Dr Rogers suggested Patterson intended to serve one beef wellington to Simon (pictured) had he turned up to the lunch.\\'If he\\'d come, I would have given him a beef Wellington too,\\' Patterson said.\\'But not one with death cap mushrooms in it intentionally.\\'02:46Patterson admits lying to policeDr Rogers suggested to Patterson she lied because if she told the truth she\\'d be \\'implicated in the poison lunch\\'.\\'I agree that I lied because I was afraid I would be held responsible,\\' Patterson said.\\'You knew that if you told police the truth then you would be immediately suspected by police of being involved in a poisoning event,\\' Dr Rogers suggested.\\'That\\'s probably true yes,\\' she said.02:46Prosecution claim Patterson weighed death capsDr Rogers (pictured left) mentioned a photo which Dr May confidently said depicted death cap mushrooms.\\'I don\\'t think they are,\\' Patterson responded.Dr Rogers also suggested Patterson saw an iNaturalist post of a death cap sighting at Loch made by Christine Mckenzie on April 18, 2023.\\'I disagree,\\' Patterson said.\\'I suggest you then went to Loch on April 28,\\' Dr Rogers said.\\'I don\\'t know if I did go to Loch on that day or not,\\' Patterson responded.\\'I suggest you went to Loch on that day to find death cap mushrooms,\\' Dr Rogers said.\\'I disagree,\\' Patterson said.Dr Rogers then showed Patterson a photo she suggested were death cap mushrooms picked from Loch.The Crown prosecutor also suggested Patterson weighed death cap mushrooms to \\'calculate the weight to administer the fatal dose required for one person\\'.Dr Rogers also suggested Patterson weighed death caps to calculate how much was needed to kill five people.Patterson said she disagreed.02:18Judge gives update on how long is left in trialJustice Christopher Beale has told the jury it\\'s likely Patterson will be in the witness box all week and possibly next week too.Justice Beale said once evidence is completed, he will have legal discussions with the parties while the jury is out.\\'Those discussions will include talk about if any more evidence is required and what direction he needs to give the jury regarded to law,\\' he said.Justice Beale said after all the evidence is completed closing addresses would commence.He predicted next week will be full due to the public holiday and the week after Justice Beale said there may be more evidence before closings.\\'Which could each take a couple of days and take up that week,\\' he said.\\'And then the jury needs to deliberate.\\'How long is a piece of string, you take all the time you need.\\'02:13Patterson denied she took photo of death capsDr Rogers has shown Patterson (pictured) several photos which had previously been exhibited.These photos depicted mushrooms and another showed a set of scales next to a dehydrator tray.Dr Rogers also showed a separate police search photo of a set of scales.Patterson agreed the scales in both photos were the same.Patterson was also asked to clarify if two images depicting mushrooms were different mushrooms.The accused killer agreed the mushrooms were different.An image also depicted mushrooms on a set of scales with the weight being 255mg.Dr Rogers showed Patterson another image of mushrooms.Dr Rogers said expert witness Dr Tom May said the mushrooms depicted in the image looked like death caps \\'at a high level of confidence\\'.\\'I suggest to you that these are death cap mushrooms which you foraged,\\' Dr Rogers said.\\'That\\'s not correct,\\' Erin said.Dr Rogers suggested Patterson foraged for death cap mushrooms in Loch after a death cap sighting was posted on plant identification website iNaturalist.01:57Patterson accused of practicing how to hide mushrooms in foodDr Rogers suggested Patterson dried and turned mushrooms into powder so she could test how to secretly put them in meals.Patterson claimed she used other foods in the dehydrator.\\'I can\\'t be specific about that but I was not just dehydrating mushrooms,\\' she said.Patterson claimed she tried to dry \\'apples, banana, quite a lot of different types of fruit\\'.Dr Rogers put it to Patterson that she only ever used the dehydrator to dry mushrooms but Patterson disagreed.Patterson admitted she secretly put dried and powered mushrooms in muffins, spaghetti, stew and brownies.\\'I was trying to get different types of vegetables into my children\\'s bodies,\\' Patterson said.01:51Patterson told she lied because she \\'deliberately poisoned lunch guests\\'Dr Rogers (pictured) suggested Patterson performed a factory reset on Phone B prior to dumping the dehydrator at the Koonwarra Transfer Station.The prosecutor is pressing Patterson to identify whether an image of a dehydrator seized from the tip is hers.\\'I presume this is the one I put in [the tip],\\' Patterson said.Dr Rogers suggested Patterson rushed from hospital to dump the dehydrator because she was aware she had dried death cap mushrooms in it.\\'I didn\\'t know that [death cap mushrooms were in the dehydrator],\\' Patterson said.\\'You knew they were death cap mushrooms,\\' Dr Rogers said.\\'You were pretty keen to get rid of any evidence, you lied to police, because you knew if you told police the truth it would implicate you in deliberately poisoning your lunch guests.\\'\\'No,\\' Patterson responded.01:41Crown commences cross-examining PattersonCrown prosecutor Dr Nanette Rogers has commenced cross-examining Patterson.Patterson agreed she bought the dehydrator from Hartly Wells - Betta Electrical in Leongatha.01:37Patterson sobs while denying intending to kill guestsPatterson has teared up when she was asked if she intended to kill or harm Don and Gail Patterson, and Ian (pictured) and Heather Wilkinson.Mr Mandy asked Patterson the questions about each individual and she responded \\'no\\' to each question while sobbing.Patterson also denied deliberately picking death cap mushrooms.01:34Patterson pleads her innocencePatterson also said she lied to police about foraging for mushrooms.\\'They were both lies,\\' she said.Mr Mandy asked Patterson if she lied when she said she only cooked one batch of beef Wellingtons.\\'No I did not lie,\\' Patterson said.\\'Were they all the same?\\' Mr Mandy asked.\\'Yes,\\' Patterson responded.\\'Did you lie about the Asian grocer purchase?\\' Mr Mandy asked.\\'No,\\' Patterson responded.\\'Did you lie about using those mushrooms in the Wellingtons?\\' Mr Mandy asked.\\'No I didn\\'t,\\' Patterson responded.\\'Did you lie about the kids eating them?\\' Mr Mandy asked.\\'No I didn\\'t,\\' Patterson responded.\\'Did you pretend to be sick?\\' Mr Mandy asked.\\'No I didn\\'t,\\' Patterson said.\\'On leaving hospital did you think anyone ate death caps?\\' Mr Mandy asked.\\'No I didn\\'t,\\' Patterson responded.\\'Were you reluctant to get treatment on July 31?\\' Mr Mandy asked.\\'On the first visit but not the second,\\' Patterson said.\\'The children?\\' Mr Mandy asked.\\'Initially I was reluctant, but once they explained to me the concern I wanted them to come in,\\' Patterson said.The trial was briefly paused.01:22Patterson lied about owning a dehydratorMr Mandy (pictured left) asked Patterson about the dehydrator.Patterson said the dehydrator was the same one she took photos of and shared images with online friends.Mr Mandy asked if Patterson lied to police about the dehydrator.\\'It was (a lie),\\' she said.Mr Mandy repeated some dialogue from the police interview:\\'Do you know anything about a dehydrator in your house?\\' Mr Mandy said.\\'Answer was \"no\".\\'Patterson responded: \\'Yes [those were lies]\\'.\\'Well I had disposed of it a few days earlier in the context of thinking maybe mushrooms that I\\'d foraged for the meal I\\'d prepared were responsible for making people sick,\\' she said.\\'It was this stupid knee jerk reaction, but I was just scared and shouldn\\'t have done it.\\'01:16Patterson reveals why she used her phone during police searchDefence barrister Colin Mandy SC asked Patterson about the use of her phone during the August 5 police search.\\'So the general principal was that it had to be out on the table in front of where I was sitting,\\' she said.\\'I couldn\\'t just be playing with it generally.\\'Patterson said she wanted to clarify if her daughter had a ballet lesson and asked police if she could text a ballet mum.Patterson said she was granted access to the phone.\\'[That was] quite early in the search, maybe an hour or so in,\\' she said.01:14Patterson assumes condition of Don and GailErin Patterson, who returned to the witness box wearing a paisley muumuu, agreed Simon told her on the Sunday that Don and Gail (pictured) were in Korumburra hospital on fluids.Patterson said she learned the pair were moved to Dandenong hospital on Monday and on Tuesday afternoon, Patterson said she learned the couple were then moved to the Austin ICU.\\'It was clear to me there had been a progression of symptoms, it seemed likely to me they were getting sicker,\\' Patterson said.00:40Trial delayed due to power outage The commencement of today\\'s murder trial session has been delayed due to an apparent power outage in parts of Morwell.Proceedings were due to start at 10.30am.Erin Patterson\\'s defence barrister, Colin Mandy SC, is pictured entering the court this morning.22:21Patterson admitted lying to family about cancer Patterson on Wednesday told the jury she spoke about her health with her lunch guests \\'right at the end of the meal\\'.\\'I mentioned I had an issue a year or two earlier where I feared I had ovarian cancer,\\' she said.\\'I\\'m not proud of this but I led them to believe that I might need some treatment for that over the next weeks and months, I did (mislead them).\\'They all showed a lot of compassion about that and then we saw Simon\\'s car driving into the driveway, so Ian said why don\\'t we pray for Erin and that\\'s what we did.\\'Patterson said she was embarrassed and ashamed that she didn\\'t have control over her body or what she ate.\\'I lied, I was ashamed, I was embarrassed, I shouldn\\'t have lied to them,\\' she said tearfully.22:21Why \\'frantic\\' Patterson dumped the dehydratorOn Wednesday, Patterson said the conversation with Simon made her think about all the times she had used the dehydrator and dried foraged mushrooms with it weeks earlier.\\'What if they got in the container with the Chinese mushrooms,\\' she said.\\'Maybe that had happened, I was thinking maybe that\\'s how this all…\\'Patterson said after she dumped the dehydrator at the tip she felt \\'scared and responsible\\'.\\'I just felt really scared,\\' she said.\\'I was frantic, people had got sick.\\'Patterson said she got the dehydrator and then drove to the Koonwarra Transfer Station tip (pictured).The jury heard the dehydrator was located and seized by police.Debris found within the appliance tested postive for death cap mushrooms.22:13Patterson sobs over Simon\\'s questionOn Wednesday, Patterson told the jury she spoke to estranged husband Simon Patterson (pictured) on August 2.She said she had a conversation with the kids about why they were at the hospital, and why everyone else was unwell.Patterson said there was concerns her lunch had made people unwell.Patterson explained how she had previously used a dehydrator to dry mushrooms.\\'(Simon) said to me \"is that how you poisoned my parents using that dehydrator?\"\\' Patterson said while sobbing in court.\\'I said \"of course not\".\\'21:54Erin Patterson to enter witness box for fourth straight day - as crowds line up outside courtErin Patterson (pictured) will resume giving evidence in her murder trial shortly after today\\'s proceedings kick off at 10.30am.Lead defence barrister Colin Mandy SC is expected to finish questioning his client before the prosecution lead by Dr Nanette Rogers SC (pictured in yellow scarf) will have an opportunity to cross-examine the accused killer.Patterson in the witness box has been a big-ticket item as far as members of the public are concerned.A crowd (pictured) started to gather outside Morwell Court, a small regional courthouse about two hours east of Melbourne, from 7am with people eager to see Patterson give evidence.The trial is sitting at the Supreme Court at Latrobe Valley Law Courts instead of the main supreme court in Victoria.

Retail Prices Index (RPI) inflation was also 0.1 percentage points too high for the month.The ONS said it would not be revising the official published figures, in line with its policy which only carries out revisions in exceptional circumstances.It also confirmed that no other periods were affected by the error.The correct vehicle excise duty data is set to be brought in for May’s inflation announcement.The tax is levied on every vehicle using public roads in the UK, including electric cars, which from April were no longer exempt.Rates for petrol cars also increased from April, with owners of the largest and most polluting vehicles seeing a doubling of the amount they have to pay in the first year.The ONS had said the tax hike was one of the biggest factors contributing to the jump in CPI inflation during the month.', 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: ONS admits inflation error due to tax\\nENTITIES: Office for National Statistics, ONS, Department for Transport, UK\\nEVENT: The ONS admitted that the April inflation figure was 0.1 percentage points too high due to an error in vehicle tax data provided by the Department for Transport.

Is It Bad I Don't Ever Have My Kids' Friends Over?'\", 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T06:00:23.000Z', 'content': 'A parent who described herself as an introvert has opened up about feeling “exhausted” by having her children’s friends over at her house – so, she avoids doing it. But she’s worried about what other parents might think. The parent of six-year-old twins said their friends are “very cute kids” but added that she doesn’t want them playing at her house. “Is that weird?” she asked r/Parenting. “My kids have been at their homes but I never have them come over to our home.”The mum caveated that if her kids do want to have a playdate, she’ll invite their friends (and their mums) to a playdate at the park. “We always go somewhere public,” she added. “I am just worried that it will ruffle feathers and the mums might think that I just don’t want to do playdates at all. That isn’t true. I just really struggle when it’s in my own home.”For context, the parent added she’s had some trouble with their cat urinating on the carpet and their litter-boxes are in the bathroom, which makes her feel “self conscious” if they have visitors.She also struggles with the balance of letting the kids play and hovering around to make sure they’re safe. She added playdates would involve “a lot of me saying ‘please don’t go on the top bunk. Please do cartwheels away from the tv. No I can’t have you play outside by yourselves’.”She continued: “And I know I should be more patient with it but it’s so exhausting for me. I struggle with it so bad. I try to be patient. I really do! I’m better away from home and with their parents around to parent them.”What does a therapist think?Helen Hazell-English, a BACP member and counsellor at Mum Therapy, told HuffPost UK “many mothers end up feeling ashamed and like they are failing in some way” thanks to society’s “perfect mother myth”.“We are all flawed, ordinary, and most of us are doing our best,” she noted.The counsellor said the matter of having playdates at home or not doesn’t have to be rigidly held onto as “an identity, problem or final decision for all time”. It’s simply her decision right now. She might change her mind as the children age and need less supervision, for instance. “Having said that it’s ok to have personal preferences, limitations and boundaries,” said Hazell-English. “She is facilitating playdates that work for her. There are no rules about what playdates have to look like.”The counsellor suggested that as time goes on, ideally she would be open to her children telling her what they think. If they ask for playdates at home and it becomes important to them, the counsellor said “if possible she could perhaps explore what’s so difficult about it for her and what she might put in place to make home playdates possible”.“This might include: keeping them short, waiting until the children are older and need less input, only inviting one friend at a time, not doing them often, having another adult help, quiet time scheduled afterwards, earplugs, staying in the garden, [doing a] certain kind of activity such as a movie night with snacks.″[There are] So many creative options to experiment with and tailor to her.”And if it’s still the case that she doesn’t want to do the playdates at home, the expert suggests she should be honest with her children and support their feelings about it.“Humans do disappoint and frustrate each other in relationships, it’s inevitable. She is allowed to say ‘no’ and they are allowed to be expressive about their feelings about that. I’m sure there are many things she does with them that are enriching and fun,” she added.Should she tell her mum friends? The counsellor noted that it sounds like the parent’s position being unspoken is causing her some social anxiety, “like she feels she is hiding something and just about getting away with it”.“It may help for the mother to recognise that she is allowed to have this boundary of only outside playdates, and to give herself compassion, grace and permission,” said Hazell-English. “She doesn’t have to explain herself but she may find it helps to tell the other mums that this is her preference, so it’s out there and established as her boundary. She can say why, but again she doesn’t have to.”', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Introverted mom questions avoiding kids' home playdates\\nENTITIES: Helen Hazell-English, Mum Therapy\\nEVENT: An introverted mother of twins seeks advice about feeling exhausted by hosting playdates at her home and preferring to meet in public places.\\nCONTEXT: Introverted parent seeks advice on avoiding home playdates.\", 'createdAt': '2025-06-05T08:04:47.658Z'}, {'id': 105147, 'sourceId': 12850, 'url': 'https://naturaldisasters.einnews.com/article/819252866/OTEy_3Aax9FLdz9_?ref=rss&ecode=5DCHg6ojdayQpKlr', 'title': 'Florida weather: Weatherman issues chilling hurricane warning amid Trump cuts', 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T07:33:05.000Z', 'content': 'John Morales, a meteorologist for NBC 6 South Florida, warned viewers that budget cuts by the Trump administration have left him unable to accurately predict the weatherJeremiah Hassel U.S. News Reporter and Charlie Jones Senior US News Reporter02:56 ET, 05 Jun 2025Updated 02:56 ET, 05 Jun 2025John Morales appeared depressed as he got on air for his usual meteorology report on NBC 6 South Florida(Image: NBC6/Youtube)A Florida weatherman has warned he won\\'t be able to predict hurricanes this year after Trump carried out sweeping budget cuts.\\u200cThis comes as the Sunshine State braces for an above-average Hurricane Season, which began on June 1.

He aspires to be a steadying force and to make Germany indispensable to Europe’s effort to stand on its own feet.But first, he and his aides know, Mr. Merz will have to get past an on-camera Oval Office performance with President Trump. The president and his administration have shown a special animus toward Germany among the European nations Mr. Trump sees more as competitors than allies.Mr. Merz, a center-right politician and wealthy former lawyer, hopes that he and the president will speak the same language. He has spent much of his first month on the job rehearsing for the test, mindful of the dressings-down some other foreign leaders have received in the Oval, including President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa.Late on Wednesday, Trump officials threw him a curveball: They moved the Oval meeting to the start of the visit, before a working lunch. German officials had expected the lunch to come first, offering the leaders a chance to hash through any disagreements in private before the cameras rolled.The Merz team knows how important the first meeting between the leaders is. Mr. Merz’s aides, who briefed reporters in advance of the visit, have spoken with advisers of other leaders who made the pilgrimage to Washington to ask about their experiences. Mr. Merz has spoken with many of those leaders himself, including a recent call with Mr. Ramaphosa.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

None delivered.This time, she says it will be different, announcing £15.6billion of investment into city transport in the North and Midlands.Buses, trams, new stations; £2.5billion for Greater Manchester and new tram stops in Bury, Oldham, and the tram to reach Stockport.On the other side of the Pennines, £2.1billion to start building West Yorkshire Mass Transit by 2028. And more projects from Tyne and Wear to Birmingham.At a bus manufacturer in Rochdale, Reeves announced that the Government is “committed to growth everywhere”, and that the Treasury’s Green Book rules were being torn up (which tend to favour the capital and South East).Katherine Forster quizzed Andy Burnham in Rochdale over Britain's broken transport networkGB NewsNext week’s Spending Review will bring hard choices, as increased defence spending and global uncertainty over trade make Reeves’s task all the harder.Real-terms cuts are coming. And tax rises are likely.So the Government yesterday was trying to get on the front foot. And Labour have been bruised by its drubbing in the local elections last month. Many of their own MPs, fearful of losing their seats after just one term, have been pushing for spending in the North.Back in January, Reeves announced an infrastructure splurge, which focused on London and the South East.They seem to have learnt some lessons from that. But is yesterday's announcement all it’s cracked up to be?Rachel Reeves delivers a speech during a visit to Mellor Bus in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, to announce a multi-billion-pound boost for city transport in the North and the MidlandsPAThe Conservatives have accused Labour of “copying and pasting” their old pledges. And it’s true that there are striking similarities with promises made by Rishi Sunak to the North when he stood in a former railway station in Manchester back in 2023 and ditched the last remaining Northern leg of HS2.And, the announcements were of funding for mayoralty regions. So questions about rail links between Northern cities went unanswered.Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham introduced the Chancellor. He was upbeat when I talked to him for GB News.He told me: “I'm confident, because people can see the change that we're already making. So, this isn't sort of pie in the sky or it'll happen one day. We're doing it.” Andy Burnham introduced the Chancellor at the eventPAHe pledges “the best integrated public transport system outside of London by the end of the decade” and with “the lowest fares possible”.But on rail, he adds: “As good as today's news was, I will not be letting the Chancellor or the Government off the hook. Because when it comes to rail travel between the big cities of the north, it's nowhere near good enough. “And the point I keep making is, why should people here be treated as second-class citizens when it comes to rail travel? Why should people lose half a morning if they're trying to go between Manchester and Leeds? They shouldn't. And we've had to put up with that for far too long.”He and Liverpool Mayor Steve Rotherham are pushing for “an Elizabeth line for the north west between Liverpool and Manchester with five stops. No more. That would be a new spine for the public transport system in the north west of England.”The money is coming from capital spending, so not hampered by the strict fiscal rules Reeves has imposed on day-to-day spending. On schools, prisons, local Government and elsewhere, there is likely pain to come.The projects will take many years, and people I spoke to are sceptical. There’s agreement that today’s plans sound good, “but will they be delivered?” one employee mused.That is the question. 16 million people in the North have heard it all before.For their sake, and for the Government’s own chances of getting back into power, they will need to be.\", 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Reeves announces £15.6B for Northern transport\\nENTITIES: Rachel Reeves, Andy Burnham, Rishi Sunak, Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire, Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds\\nEVENT: Rachel Reeves announced a £15.6 billion investment in city transport for the North and Midlands, including buses, trams, and new stations, with funding for Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire.\\nCONTEXT: The government is trying to regain trust in the North after failing to deliver on previous promises, but faces challenges with funding and skepticism from the public.', 'createdAt': '2025-06-05T08:04:47.658Z'}, {'id': 105967, 'sourceId': 12609, 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/05/gold-medals-inspire-lasting-change-uk-sport', 'title': 'Can gold medals really inspire lasting change? It’s time we tried to find out', 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T07:01:01.000Z', 'content': 'Sighs of relief accompanied the appointment of Prof Nick Webborn as chair of UK Sport after a lengthy delay and rumours of existential threats from Whitehall’s latest quango bonfire. It is a tricky time to take over as sport hangs in limbo without a strong advocate at the cabinet table as impossible funding and policy decisions are being made.At the same time, attitudes and expectations towards public bodies are changing as social needs and demands change. The need to justify the benefit to society of funding those who are world class at their sport is greater than ever. Arguably, there can be no organisation more suited to taking on difficult questions and reaching new heights than the agency that funds and masterminds Olympic and Paralympic high performance. So what’s top of Webborn’s in-tray?There is always the need to check in with the vision, the purpose, the raison d’être. Set up in 1997 after Great Britain won one gold medal in the Atlanta Olympics, UK Sport’s mission was to ensure Team\\xa0GB produced performances commensurate with the nation’s size and potential with consistent funding to create a world-leading system. In short, to become world class. It was unacceptable to finish 36th in the medal table and no longer a reasonable strategy to rely on outlier athletes to win largely through their own efforts. The best athletes from that point on would receive the best technical, physiological and medical support in return for medals.The system worked beyond the wildest dreams of its architects, Sue Campbell and Peter Keen, who had never imagined reaching tallies of 29 gold medals would be possible at a single Olympics. Mind you, nor had they envisaged the cultural abuses that might accompany a newfound focus on medals above all else.Over recent years, UK Sport adjusted its strategy to the aim of “winning well”, but leaders and coaches complain this remains poorly defined, while the clarity of medal expectations still dominates. A mantra of “medals and more” was introduced though this seemed largely to emphasise that medals came first and the rest was rather vague and secondary.Anthony Joshua won Great Britain’s 29th gold medal at London 2012. Photograph: Julien Behal/PABringing teeth to what “winning well” looks like – after checking whether the phrase still has credibility across theelite sports world, its athletes, coaches, leaders – feels essential for steering high-performance sport through its next phase. It is interesting to note the energy and passion the Australian system is putting into bringing this phrase to life.There was a clear and striking vision in 1997 that fitted the wider social context – a different vision is needed for a very different era. The next issue in the in-tray may help. UK Sport has been talking more about increasing “social impact”. Recent organisational changes at UK Sport led to the social impact team being reduced and merged into the communications team, but this area needs to have greater substance, and less rhetoric, to seriously explore what “lasting positive social impact” could come beyond the Olympic and Paralympic medal table.UK Sport’s strategy refers to “the powerful platform sporting success has to inspire and effect lasting positive change for individuals and society”. Those deeply invested in the current system or who have excelled through it fully buy into this. Yet serious evidence of this happening at scale is hard to come by. Recent research showed that any minor uplifts in the form of increased physical activity or subjective wellbeing during London 2012 fizzled out once the event had finished. The narrative that Olympians inspire the next generation is often fuelled by stories that are told energetically, while on a larger scale, evidence shows that young people are often more inspired by a teacher or local coach than an Olympic champion who is simply too distant to relate to.In these tumultuous times, it is surely essential to explore how money spent on medals and “inspirational moments” could produce something deeper and longer lasting. Webborn brings vital relevant experience as chair of the British Paralympic Association, which has set a social impact strategy through to 2032 with clear ambitions to improve access to sport and help break down societal barriers for those with disabilities.Hannah Cockroft (right) and Kare Adenegan were part of a successful ParalympicsGB team in Paris last summer. The body was led by the new UK Sport chair, Nick Webborn. Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesHere’s hoping Webborn and his team have insights into how to be more effective than in the past. Sport doesn’t have a great record on changing the lives of disabled people for the better, a point Tanni Grey‑Thompson has been vocal about for years.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionUnderstanding the need to move on from Olympians showing medals in school assemblies, UK Sport launched a pioneering programme, “Powered by Purpose”, to support athletes to become agents of change for causes they care about, enabling them to use their platforms and role-model status for good effect beyond winning medals, while also bringing to life the theory that flourishing athletes perform better and more sustainably when there is a wider meaning in their sporting journey beyond the scoreboard.It is a great move but this is social impact one stage removed, effectively outsourcing it to a few athletes without UK\\xa0Sport holding itself accountable beyond medals. The question for Webborn is how could UK Sport use its innovative talents and peerless determination to explore what lasting social value could come from those medals.There are no existing solutions as it hasn’t really been tried. The past 28 years have proved that medals can be won without much lasting positive social change. The challenge is to prove that the same or greater levels of performance can be achieved in a way that brings greater positive outcomes for others. That will require a different mindset and belief that says winning matters but is not enough on its own; and it will require a whole different set of impact-focused skills within the organisation.This will also require a different and much more integrated working relationship with its sister organisation that looks after grassroots sport, Sport\\xa0England, to learn from their ongoing experiences\\xa0(and\\xa0failures) about how sport can be an effective tool for social change.But what an opportunity for UK Sport, which exists to dare to make the impossible possible. UK Sport’s stated purpose and mission is to create “extraordinary moments” over the next decade. Webborn’s challenge and opportunity is to use the funding and talents of the country to create something much longer lasting.\\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

While Russia was previously a party to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)—a multilateral agreement that placed limits on Iran\\'s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief—it has taken a backseat amid shifting diplomatic dynamics and the U.S. withdrawal under Trump\\'s prior administration.After the call, Putin aide Yury Ushakov confirmed Trump\\'s account, saying the U.S. president believed \"Russia\\'s assistance may be necessary\" and would welcome Moscow working with the Iranian side.\\nMoscow and Tehran TiesEarlier this year, Russia and Iran signed a 20-year strategic partnership agreement, formalizing cooperation across military, economic, and technological sectors.The treaty, ratified by both nations\\' parliaments, includes provisions for joint military exercises, intelligence sharing, and collaboration on energy projects. This deepening alliance reflects a shared intent to counter Western influence and navigate around sanctions, which they both face.U.S.-Iran TalksSo far, negotiations between Washington and Tehran have failed to produce a new agreement. The U.S. wants Iran to halt uranium enrichment to prevent it building nuclear weapons, while Iran says its program is for peaceful, civilian energy purposes. No breakthrough has been reached, and prospects have dimmed further after Iran\\'s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday that the latest U.S. proposal contradicts Iran\\'s national interests.\\nIn this picture released by an official website of the office of the Iranian supreme leader, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, right, speaks with Russia\\'s President Vladimir Putin, in Tehran, Iran, Friday, Sept. 7, 2018....\\nOffice of the Iranian Supreme Leader/AP photo\\nWhat People Are SayingPresident Donald Trump: \"President Putin suggested that he will participate in the discussions with Iran and that he could, perhaps, be helpful in getting this brought to a rapid conclusion.\"Yury Ushakov, aide to President Putin: \"Donald Trump believes that Russia\\'s assistance may be necessary here, and he would appreciate it if Russia could work with the Iranian side accordingly.\"Negar Mortazavi, senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, editor and host of The Iran Podcast told Newsweek: \"President Trump\\'s suggestion that Putin could assist in the Iran talks signals a continued interest in striking a nuclear deal.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., nodding to an executive order President Trump signed in January aimed at achieving that outcome.During a hearing on Wednesday to discuss the possibility, Judge Richard Leon of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia nonetheless cautioned that he intended to proceed slowly and prioritize privacy in an extended process to determine whether any documents should be released before 2027, the date that another judge set in 1977 for the documents to be unsealed.Judge Leon said he would start by ordering the National Archives to show him — and him alone — an inventory of all the sealed materials related to Dr. King that have been stored there.He said that the inventory, which the government says it has not reviewed, might help shed light on whether documents specifically related to Dr. King’s assassination in 1968, and the investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation that followed, had been separated out and could be efficiently processed.The hearing on Wednesday came through a lawsuit brought by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the civil rights organization based in Atlanta associated with Dr. King, which has sued to halt any effort to unseal documents early.It came in response to an executive order Mr. Trump signed in January that directed intelligence agencies to set in motion plans to release records related to the assassinations of Dr. King, President John F. Kennedy and Senator Robert F. Kennedy.During Wednesday’s hearing, Johnny Walker, a lawyer for the Justice Department, proposed that Judge Leon authorize the department’s agents to look through the papers first and to fish out a subset that the court and associates of Dr. King could then approve for release.Mr. Walker said the group would steer clear of potentially damaging details about Dr. King’s life that might have been stored in F.B.I. surveillance records that the Trump administration has moved to unseal.Sumayya Saleh, a lawyer representing the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, said that the larger effort was part of a “deliberate effort to undermine the civil rights movement” and to “discredit” Dr. King’s legacy. She said it was far too difficult to define what documents were solely related to Dr. King’s death and that the government was asking the court to defy its own ruling from 48 years ago.Judge Leon said the proposals discussed at the hearing were “the first few steps in a journey” that could take several years.“This is delicate stuff,” he said.However, he added that if the two sides could reach an agreement on a way to jointly review the sealed documents and settle on a subset that both felt could be made public, he could “bless” that decision and move more quickly to unseal them.“Keep the lines of communication open,” he said. “That’s in everyone’s interest, including the president’s.”Zach Montague is a Times reporter covering the U.S. Department of Education, the White House and federal courts.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Judge Considers Early Release King Assassination Documents\\nENTITIES: Martin Luther King Jr., President Trump, Judge Richard Leon, Southern Christian Leadership Conference, Federal Bureau of Investigation\\nEVENT: A federal judge is considering releasing sealed documents related to Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination earlier than the scheduled date of 2027, following an executive order by President Trump.

One poll, published a month on from the supreme court ruling that the legal definition of “woman” in the Equality Act is based on biological sex, found 63% supportive of the ruling and 18% opposed. But younger people were far more likely to be in the latter camp, with 53% of 18- to 24-year-olds disagreeing with the judgment. In my age group, 50-64, the figure was just 13%. Such results echo earlier polls.As with any attempt to link a demographic with a point of view, there are plenty of exceptions. Last month Lady Hale, the octogenarian former president of the supreme court, became one of them when she argued that the ruling had been misinterpreted, telling a literary festival she had met doctors “who said there is no such thing as biological sex”.The progressive explanation for the age gap is in the name: progress. As the arc of history bends towards justice, younger people are ahead of the curve. Social scientists call this a cohort effect, which basically means that when you are born is one of the influences (along with income, education and so on) on your politics. In relation to transgender rights, the reasoning is that people born since the 1980s are more relaxed about sex and sexuality, and more committed to personal freedoms including the right to define one’s own identity. The obvious catch to this analysis, at the moment, is the way some young men have swung towards the hard right.If a cohort effect applies when it comes to gender, and assuming that future cohorts are in agreement, gender identity advocates can look forward to winning this argument eventually. Older, conservative voters (and politicians and judges and journalists such as me), who don’t think someone’s trans identity should take precedence over their biological sex when society decides which sports teams or prisons they belong in, are just causing a delay. This was the view endorsed by David Lammy in 2021 when he said there were “dinosaurs […] in our own party” who want to “hoard rights”. The extinction of such people would, he implied, sort things out in the end.Along with other middle-aged, gender-critical women, I have got used to dismissals such as Lammy’s. One of us, Victoria Smith, wrote a book about such attitudes and called it Hags. But terminology aside, I think those who characterise this struggle as being between young progressives and ageing reactionaries are mistaken. While I fully support transgender people’s right to be protected from discrimination, I don’t regard the erosion of sex-based entitlements – including single-sex sports and spaces – in favour of an ethos of “inclusion” as either liberal or leftwing.On the contrary, I think valuing inclusion over bodily privacy (in changing rooms) or fairness (in sports) is sexist – since women are more disadvantaged by these changes than men. And while gender identity campaigners claim autonomy and choice as progressive, even socialist, values, I see their emphasis on the individual’s right to self-definition as congruent with consumer capitalism. Multinational corporations, including banks and retailers, embrace Stonewall’s Workplace Equality Index and fly Progress Pride flags from their buildings because the shift away from the class politics of redistribution towards the identity politics of personal expression suits them.In 2023 the 40th British Social Attitudes survey described the widening age gap in UK politics as “a puzzle”, with changing party loyalties only partly mirrored in answers to questions seeking to place people on a left-right spectrum or a liberal-authoritarian one. To anyone looking for answers to the question of why such age differences exist – in relation to the supreme court or other issues – I would suggest that as well as cohorts (gen X versus Z and so on), they should consider the life cycle. Clearly, some things matter more to people as they get older, pensions being an obvious example. What if biological sex is another?This rings true with aspects of my own experience. For example, it wasn’t until I had children that I learned about birth injuries, came face to face with pregnancy and maternity discrimination, or understood that the gender pay gap is also a motherhood penalty. It’s not that I hadn’t been aware of my female body before this. But one of the things about having babies is the way that the biological and social become so enmeshed. More recently, I’ve become fascinated by female evolutionary thinkers such as Sarah Hrdy, whose life’s work has been to explore this tangle.Now, at 53, there is menopause and ageing. Most weeks my yoga teacher has something to say about the importance for women of strength-building exercises to ward off osteoporosis; of keeping our femur bones firmly in our hip sockets and using muscles to hold our reproductive organs in place.That male and female bodies go wrong in different ways is nothing new: the most common cancer for women worldwide is breast cancer, while in England prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed in men. What has only recently become better known, thanks to advances in medical research and campaigners such as Caroline Criado Perez, is that even when we get the same diseases there are differences, with examples including heart disease, Parkinson’s and dementia.As with reproduction, later-life physiological divergences have social and economic consequences. Social care is a feminist issue due to women’s greater longevity, as well as the sector’s predominantly female workforce. Most of the poorest pensioners are single women as many wives outlive their husbands, but also because of lower average lifetime earnings linked to women taking breaks from employment to care for children.And what about men? Like women, the older they are, the less likely they are to tell pollsters that gender identity should replace biological sex as a legal and social category. This makes sense to me, since my argument is that consciousness of sexual difference accumulates across the life-course. The fact that men are far less likely to be actively involved in campaigning on this issue than gender-critical women – even when they agree with us – is also easy to understand. Now, as in the past, men need legal protection against sex-based discrimination, abuse or injustice much less often than women.I don’t presume to predict that today’s gender identity activists will one day change their minds. But it has never seemed clearer to me than it does now that women and men have some different needs and experiences that the law must recognise. Far from an old fogey’s statute, I think the 15-year-old Equality Act, with its staunch protection of sex-based rights, is full of life.\\nSusanna Rustin is a social affairs journalist and the author of Sexed: A History of British Feminism\\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

If Mamdani were elected Mayor, Cuomo added, Trump would go through him like a “hot knife through butter.”The crowded debate stage also featured Adrienne Adams, speaker of the New York City Council; Brad Lander, the current New York City comptroller; Scott Stringer, the former comptroller; Michael Blake, a former state assemblyman from the Bronx; Zellnor Myrie, a Brooklyn state senator; Jessica Ramos, a Queens state senator; and Whitney Tilson, a former hedge fund manager.Cuomo was a frequent target throughout the night, with candidates launching attacks at his record, criticizing his handling of nursing home deaths during the Covid-19 pandemic and the sexual harassment allegations.A 2021 report by the New York attorney general found that the Cuomo administration undercounted thousands of deaths of state nursing home residents during the pandemic.On Wednesday, Cuomo defended the report and insisted that nursing home deaths were not undercounted.“There was no doubt that my administration produced the report, and it did not undercount the deaths,” Cuomo said.He also defended himself against the harassment claims, saying, “the report was done. Nothing has come out of it.”Current New York City Mayor Eric Adams was also frequently criticized on the debate stage despite not being there. Adams announced earlier this year that he would seek re-election as an independent candidate although he ran as a Democrat in 2021.At one point, when asked about their biggest political regrets, City Council speaker Adrienne Adams replied, “My biggest regret is believing that Eric Adams would be a good mayor for all New Yorkers.”Mamdani said his regret was “trusting leaders of Democratic party like Cuomo.”While Cuomo answered: “the state of the Democratic party” prompting backlash from Speaker Adams.“No personal regrets?” she asked. “No regrets when it comes to cutting Medicaid or healthcare? No regrets when it comes to slow-walking PPE and vaccinations in the season of Covid to Black and brown communities? Really, no regrets?”.Cuomo pushed back, calling her claims “inaccurate” and saying that “Medicaid went up under me.”Wednesday’s debate marked the first of two scheduled Democratic primary debates before the primary election later this month. The second debate is set for 12 June.The Democratic primary election will be held on 24 June, with early voting beginning 10 days earlier, on 14 June. New Yorkers will cast their votes using ranked-choice ballot, allowing them to select up to five candidates in order of preference.The general mayoral election is scheduled for 4 November.', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: NYC Mayoral Candidates Debate Housing, Covid, Trump\\nENTITIES: Andrew Cuomo, Zohran Mamdani, Adrienne Adams, Eric Adams, New York City\\nEVENT: Democratic candidates for New York City mayor debated housing, Covid-19 response, and their ability to handle the Trump administration, with Cuomo and Mamdani clashing over experience and funding.\\nCONTEXT: The debate highlights the key issues and divisions within the Democratic party in New York City.', 'createdAt': '2025-06-05T08:04:47.658Z'}, {'id': 105644, 'sourceId': 12506, 'url': 'https://www.techradar.com/streaming/entertainment/watch-virgin-island-online-and-for-free', 'title': 'How to watch Virgin Island online and for FREE &ndash; stream all episodes from USA, Australia, Canada', 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T07:32:37.000Z', 'content': \"(Image credit: Channel 4)\\nA group of singles in a sun-soaked locale?

By\\xa0Zak Garner-Purkis, Investigations Editor 07:00, Thu, Jun 5, 2025 | UPDATED: 09:12, Thu, Jun 5, 2025 Migrants in a makeshift camp on London’s billionaire row shouted and screamed at an Express reporter who asked why they were refusing to leave.The Romanian migrants said they had the “right to be there” when asked whether they’d obey an eviction notice handed to them by the landowner.\\xa0Locals have raged at the tent city that popped up on the central reservation of Park Lane—opposite a private jet sales suite - four months ago.Migrants in the camp have been seen defecating in public and holding loud drinking sessions late into the night on a stretch of road previously known for having millionaire playboys in Lamborghinis revving their engines.\\xa0When asked why they thought this was acceptable behaviour in the neighbourhood, where homes sell for £13 million on average, one man in the camp said, “there was nowhere to go.”“We don’t have a job,” he shouted. “We have the right to stay here. If you have any questions, you should go to the council. We have permission to stay.”The was an angry response from the beggars at London\\'s Park Lane (Image: Jeremy Selwyn)Romanian migrants hide themselves from the camera when accusations of bad behaviour are put to them (Image: Jeremy Selwyn)The group refused to answer questions about allegations from local workers and other homeless people that they’d been involved in incidents of stealing or claims that the police had twice visited the site.A homeless migrant from Africa living opposite the Romanian tents on the central reservation told the Express he was the first person to pitch up on the land, which is owned by Sadiq Khan\\'s Transport for London.“One of them saw me and then told me their friends would come,” he said. “Then they all came and set up tents.“They are very noisy, having loud arguments into the night. Sometimes, they come and go to the toilet near my tent, and I have to tell them to leave.“I don’t go to the bathroom around here. I’m clean and use the local mosque.”The man, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, showed off his courier bicycle, which he used to earn a living while living rough. He was preparing to leave and intended to comply with the court order.“They don’t work,” he added, gesturing at the Romanian group. \"They go begging. In the morning, they gather around and then get sent to different spots.”This claim was repeated by another homeless man from Northern Ireland, who was begging in Green Park.He told the Express that there were so many Romanian beggars in the area between Knightsbridge and Hyde Park Corner that it was impossible for other nationalities to set up a pitch asking for cash.

Read our Privacy PolicyBeggars at the site have angered neighbours by defecating in public (Image: Jeremy Selwyn)“Every two feet it seems like there’s another one,” he said. “Sometimes all the British homeless get together and push them out.”Visiting the site both early in the morning and late at night, the Express witnessed first-hand how beggars prepared to head to specific spots around Mayfair and Park Lane with pre-written ‘Homeless, can you help - God Bless’ signs.We watched one man carry a walking stick under his arm for half a mile. Before begging he stopped in a side street and changed his clothes, swapping a fresh flat cap for a ragged beanie and warm coat to a ragged one. He then sat down opposite St James’ Park on a cardboard box, presenting himself as injured.\\xa0After struggling to collect change from passing strangers, he switched his position, pulling a blanket over his legs and lying on the floor. This resulted in several pound coins being dropped in his cup.When the Express spoke to the Romanian group, we immediately recognised them as occupants of a homeless encampment on the other side of Park Lane that caused similar problems last summer.\\xa0During a visit to the site with a Romanian translator, the same group told how generations of families had been living on the site for years, with some of the older squatters claiming to have been based around Park Lane for over a decade.At that time, the camp patriarch, who called himself Vijay, claimed he couldn’t speak to the press because God forbid him to. But he insisted reports of problems from the group were untrue.This was disputed by a different homeless man called Marius, who told us the group came from the same small town and he feared them because they were into “trouble and drinking.” Asked to comment on the public defecation, abuse of local workers, allegations of theft, and organised begging, a spokesperson for landowner TfL said: “We continue to do all we can to ensure everyone\\'s safety.\\xa0“This includes taking legal and enforcement action and working with Westminster City Council, the Greater London Authority, and local charities to resolve the situation.\\xa0“We will not stand for abuse, assault or any other criminal or antisocial behaviour anywhere on our transport network and any allegations should be reported to the police.”They added: \"No one should be faced with sleeping rough on London’s streets.\\u202fPark\\u202fLane\\u202fis a busy part of the road network that is not a safe place for people to sleep rough and our focus has always been on the safety and welfare of everyone involved.\\xa0\"We have been working closely with Westminster City Council and other partners over many months to try to resolve the issue at Park Lane compassionately and safely.\\xa0“We had to take enforcement action to regain possession of the site on two occasions last year, however, a number of people have returned with tents and other belongings. We have been granted a possession order by the Court and are working through the next steps with our partners.”Westminster City Council rejected the migrants claim they had been allowed to say and told the Express it too was working on the process of safely clearing the site.“The central reservation of Park Lane is not a safe place for anybody to live and we’re concerned about the welfare of those sleeping there,” a spokesperson said.\\xa0“However, we are clear that the anti-social behaviour associated with this encampment is unacceptable.Men at the camp relax together with a bottle of vodka on one of London\\'s most expensive streets (Image: Jeremy Selwyn)“We have supported TfL with their recent site clearances and wider enforcement action. TFL have recently obtained a new possession order and are working to obtain the writ of possession through the courts. We’ll work with TfL to make sure this happens as quickly as possible.\"The City Council, our charity partners, TfL and London wide rough sleeping teams all regularly visit the people on Park Lane. Our support services are comprehensive and there is no reason a person should have to sleep rough – on this site or anywhere else in the city. \" “Everyone wants to see a safe, long-term resolution to the persistent issues at this site.”The charity St Mungos, which is part of the effort to support the squatters on Park Lane, said the group in Park Lane was part of a much bigger issue in London with street homelessness.It said“We continue to see an increase in the numbers of people rough sleeping throughout our services. In fact, our Outreach teams are out on the street every night of the year, responding to people who are rough sleeping.“St Mungo’s works with everyone affected by this issue to understand their rights and entitlements and support needs.\\xa0“We help people move on from rough sleeping and rebuild their lives.

I’d been there for eight years, which is a long time to play a character, and I have absolutely loved being in the show.\"They gave me the opportunity to learn on the job and also now I am able to take that onto other things that I do.\"Of course it’s sad but at the same time it felt like a natural end, with the Taylors being gone, it kind of felt right.

Meanwhile, the entry of nationals of Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela will be partially restricted.The US president said that he “considered foreign policy, national security, and counterterrorism goals” in deciding the scope of the ban. Trump had cued up the ban in an executive order signed on 20 January, his first day back in the White House, instructing his administration to submit a list of candidates for a ban by 21 March.Trump has cited a range of justifications for the bans, including national security and concerns that visitors from those countries are overstaying their visas.But advocates and experts have said that blanket travel bans discriminate against groups of people based on ethnicity alone. They will likely result – as the travels bans did during Trump’s first term – in the separation of families. The bans on travel from Haiti, Cuba and Venezuela could be especially impactful in US communities with huge immigrant populations from those countries.“This discriminatory policy, which limits legal immigration, not only flies in the face of what our country is supposed to stand for, it will be harmful to our economy and communities that rely on the contributions of people who come to America from this wide range of countries,” said Pramila Jayapal, a Democratic representative of Washington.The decision to ban travel from these countries comes amid a wave of hardline immigration policies that Trump has issued, including the blocking of asylum claims at the southern border and cancelling temporary protected status for immigrants from a number of countries facing deep humanitarian crises. Trump has also signed a proclamation to restrict foreign student visas at Harvard University and ordered US consulates to conduct social media screening of every visa applicant seeking to travel to the university.In a video message released on social media, Trump said he was making good on a promise to act following the recent attack at a Boulder, Colorado, event showing support for Israeli hostages. The attack by an Egyptian national “underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted, as well as those who come here as temporary visitors and overstay their visas. We don’t want them,” he said.Trump added that the list was “subject to revisions based on whether material improvements are made” and that “likewise, new countries could be added as threats emerge around the world”.Having instituted a travel ban on Muslim countries early in his first term, Trump trailed his plans for a new ban during his election campaign against Kamala Harris last year.“I will ban refugee resettlement from terror-infested areas like the Gaza Strip, and we will seal our border and bring back the travel ban,” Trump said in September. “Remember the famous travel ban? We didn’t take people from certain areas of the world. We’re not taking them from infested countries.”skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionProtesters rally against Donald Trump’s earlier travel ban in 2018. Photograph: Mohammed Elshamy/Anadolu via Getty ImagesHe was referring to the ban he imposed after taking office in January 2017, leading to chaos at airports as protesters and civil rights attorneys rushed to help affected travelers.Trump said the ban was needed to combat terrorist threats. It was blocked by federal courts on civil liberties grounds but the US supreme court, to which Trump would eventually appoint three hardline rightwing justices, allowed the ban to stand.The supreme court said Trump’s ban did not target Muslims – despite the fact it originally targeted travelers from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, Muslim-majority countries. According to the court, the ban fell within the remit of a president’s national security powers. North Korea and Venezuela were also included.The Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair) said then: “The Muslim ban’s bigotry should have been as clear to the supreme court as it is to the Muslims demonized by it.

Earlier today, Judge Christopher Bealeset out a rough timeline for the 14-member jury – who were expecting the trial to last around six weeks.But this is already week six, and he warns them there\\'s still a way to go.\"I’m not going to put a figure on how much time is left to run in this trial but let me just summarise for you,\" he said. Ms Patterson will most likely be in the witness box until early next week, followed by a few days of legal discussion and the possibility of \"more evidence\".The prosecution and defence will give their closing addresses and then, Justice Beale said, he\\'ll deliver final directions which \"takes quite a bit of time\".Then the jury will deliberate – and he said he can\\'t put an exact date on this.He reminded the jury they should take all the time they need. He joked that next week is a shorter one as there\\'s a public holiday on Monday – \"some good news\" – to much laughter from the jury members.\\nRe-cap of the day: Dehydrators, kitchen scales and emojispublished at 07:36 British Summer Time07:36 BSTpublished at 06:3606:36Lana LamLive digital reporter\\nFor the fourth day in a row, Erin Patterson gave evidence in her triple murder case.

She says she is struggling to express what she meant by that. Then she says there was \"difficulty\" in the relationship between Simon Patterson and their son. A moment later, the judge suggests that court finish early, partly owing to someone in the court room having a cough, which the judge suggests might distract Dr Rogers.

She is referring to messages sent to Don and Gail Patterson, asking if Erin Patterson at one point let Don and Gail know that school fees were in dispute, Dr Rogers asks. Erin Patterson she agrees that she said in a messge to Don and Gail that Simon\\'s refusing to pay school fees was a \"punishment\" for Erin Patterson claiming child support. She says she did this because she felt that if Don and Gail knew how Simon was behaving, they might encourage him to \"change his behaviour\".\\nQuestioning moves to Simon Patterson\\'s \\'single\\' tax statuspublished at 06:59 British Summer Time06:59 BSTpublished at 05:5905:59\\nMs Patterson is now being asked about her husband\\'s tax status, specifically, when he changed his marital status to \"single\" on his tax return.

I’m not sure.\"It is alleged she used the fake cancer diagnosis as an excuse to get people to her house for the meal – though Patterson is adamant she never claimed to have had a diagnosis.Dr Rogers takes Ms Patterson back to parts of her testimony earlier this week. She quotes Ms Patterson:\"I\\'m not proud of this, but I led them to believe I might be needing some treatment in regards to [ovarian cancer] in the next few weeks or months.\"Ms Patterson agrees she said this.\\nFast-paced day in courtpublished at 06:31 British Summer Time06:31 BSTpublished at 05:3105:31Katy Watsonreporting from Morwell\\nThe first few days Erin Patterson was in the witness box, she was being questioned by her lawyer – given time to explain what happened at that meal in 2023 and in the days afterwards. But that has dramatically changed today. The prosecutor Nanette Rogers is firing questions at Ms Patterson rapidly, switching between bits of evidence and making accusations that she deliberately poisoned her relatives and lied about health concerns to lure them to her lunch of death-cap-mushroom-laced beef Wellington.Erin Patterson is denying all accusations – on occasion she asks the prosecutor to repeat the question and takes her times before replying.\\nMs Patterson denies telling lunch guests she had cancerpublished at 06:24 British Summer Time06:24 BSTpublished at 05:2405:24Helen SullivanLive editor\\nQuestioning is now turning to what Ms Patterson said at the lunch.\"Did you tell people at the lunch you had cancer?\" Dr Rogers says. \"No,\" says Ms Patterson. Ian Wilkinson, the sole surviving guest, told the court that Ms Patterson had revealed she had cancer and talked about a \"diagnostic test\".He said she had been anxious about telling her children about what he described as a \"threat to her life\". Ms Patterson says she did not ask the guests about whether to tell children about a \"threat to her life\", and says she did not say she had cancer. She did say she told them she had been doing some testing.Dr Rogers takes her to a passage from Mr Wilkinson\\'s testimony where he said Ms Patterson talked about a scan that showed a spot that could be a tumour.Ms Patterson denies this happened. Dr Rogers again asks whether Ms Patterson told her lunch guests she had cancer, and she again denies this.\\n\\'A bit to digest\\' from fictional medical appointment, Ms Patterson wrotepublished at 06:15 British Summer Time06:15 BSTpublished at 05:1505:15James ChaterLive reporter\\nThe prosecution is reading a message from Ms Patterson sent to Gail Patterson, her mother-in-law, in response to a text asking how a biopsy appointment had gone.In it, Ms Patterson says there is a \"bit to digest\" from the appointment, which Ms Patterson has acknowledged was a lie. There was no appointment, and no medical information to digest.\"I might talk about it with you both when I see you in person,\" the message to Gail continued.Dr Rogers asks: \"In this message you purported to carry on the fiction that you had a very serious illness?\"\"Yeah that’s fair,\" Ms Patterson says.The prosecution continues that soon after this message was sent, Ms Patterson invited the family members to the fatal lunch.\\n\\'I didn\\'t give them any reason... I just invited them\\'published at 06:03 British Summer Time06:03 BSTpublished at 05:0305:03\\nMs Patterson is answering questions about what the prosecution calls her \"so-called cancer diagnosis\".She has previously agreed that she lied about having cancer.The prosecution is saying that research Ms Patterson conducted on ovarian and brain cancer would have allowed her to \"tell a more convincing lie about having cancer\".“I mean, theoretically that’s true, but that’s not what I did,” she replies. She said she\\'d researched those conditions because she thought she may have them.When Ms Patterson invited her guests to lunch, the prosecution says, she \"pretended\" she had \"a legitimate reason to speak with them\".\"I didn’t give them any reason when I invited them, I just invited them,\" Ms Patterson said.The court has previously heard the guests believed they were invited to her house to discuss a health issue.\\nMs Patterson was \\'mocking\\' religious advice, prosecution allegespublished at 05:47 British Summer Time05:47 BSTpublished at 04:4704:47James ChaterLive reporter\\nThis emoji chat follows questions about whether Ms Patterson said on a Facebook group that she was an atheist. Ms Patterson denied doing this, and has told the court she is a Christian.The prosecution is alleging that, when using the emojis in these messages, Ms Patterson was reacting to advice from her in-laws to pray.\"I suggest that you were mocking their advice to you,\" the prosecution says. \"Part of your mockery was the religious component of the\\nadvice.\"Ms Patterson denies the accusation, saying she was \"not mocking\" the suggestion of praying, she was just \"frustrated\" it was being offered as the only solution to the issues being discussed.\\nDiscussion turns to emojispublished at 05:45 British Summer Time05:45 BSTpublished at 04:4504:45Helen SullivanLive editor\\nToday has involved in-depth discussions of food dehydrators, kitchen scales, and now... emojis. Dr Rogers accuses Ms Patterson of using \"eye-roll\" emojis in response to suggestions from Don Patterson that the family pray. Dr Rogers says that Ms Patterson used eye-roll emojis with messages she sent to a Facebook group of friends about Don\\'s suggestions. She shows Ms Patterson the emojis in question, and Ms Patterson argues that the emoji in at least one of the messages is a face with a straight line for a mouth – but not an eye-rolling emoji. She\\'s asked to explain what she meant when using them. Dr Rogers then suggests Ms Patterson was responding with mockery, by using the emojis. Ms Patterson replies that she was frustrated, not mocking.\\nCourt debating the definition of \\'mushrooming\\'published at 05:31 British Summer Time05:31 BSTpublished at 04:3104:31\\nWe\\'ve hearing a bit of a back and forth about what \"mushrooming\" means.The court has heard a doctor asked Ms Patterson if she had been mushrooming in the days after the lunch, but Ms Patterson says she doesn\\'t recall that and also isn\\'t precisely sure what the doctor would have meant by that question.What do you think mushrooming means, the prosecution asks her.You might use it in regard to foraging, but might also use it in regard to \"other uses of mushrooms that are not eating\", says Ms Patterson.\\nWe\\'re backpublished at 05:18 British Summer Time05:18 BSTpublished at 04:1804:18\\nCourt proceedings have resumed with the accused, Erin Patterson, still on the stand.This afternoon, she\\'ll face more question from the prosecution, led by Nannette Rogers SC.\\nA reminder of who is whopublished at 05:04 British Summer Time05:04 BSTpublished at 04:0404:04\\nHere\\'s a reminder of who attended the fatal lunch, who died afterwards, and how they are related to Erin Patterson. Don Patterson, Gail Patterson and Heather Wilkinson are the deceased. Ian Wilkinson attended the lunch, but survived after being in an induced coma for weeks.\\nHow will the jury make its decision?published at 04:51 British Summer Time04:51 BSTpublished at 03:5103:51Helen SullivanLive editor\\nFifteen jurors - three more than usual - were selected for the trial, which began about six weeks ago. But a male juror was discharged after the judge found there was a \"reasonable possibility\" he had discussed the case with family and friends. There are now 14 jurors.But only 12 will deliberate over the verdict. After the court has heard all the evidence, that dozen will be randomly selected and the other two people sent home. At the opening of the trial back at the end of April, Justice Christopher Beale explained that when the jurors start their deliberations, they will be sequestered to protect the jury \"from any interference or outside pressure\" and to \"safeguard the integrity of their verdicts\".This means that once the jury has heard the closing speeches and final directions from Justice Beale, they will be bussed to a hotel at an undisclosed location, where they will stay overnight, before being bussed back to the court the next morning to continue deliberations.At the moment, the jury is able to go home at the end of each day in court.Justice Beale has also told the jury that their verdicts must be unanimous, meaning all 12 jurors must agree on the same conclusion.\\nThree things to know about the trial so farpublished at 04:33 British Summer Time04:33 BSTpublished at 03:3303:33\\nOur correspondent Katy Watson has been following the case since it started, here\\'s the key things you need to know in under 90 seconds.Media caption, Watch: Three things you need to know about Australia\\'s mushroom murder trial\\nCourt adjourned for lunch - here\\'s your recappublished at 04:23 British Summer Time04:23 BSTpublished at 03:2303:23James ChaterLive reporter\\nCourt has now adjourned for lunch, so let\\'s take a look back at what we heard this morning:First, Ms Patterson faced more questions from her defence lawyer, Colin Mandy SC:\\nMs Patterson admitted to lying to police about owning a food dehydrator because she was scared that the meal she had prepared was making people sick. \"It was a stupid knee-jerk reaction,\" she said\\nShe denied intentionally picking death cap mushrooms and putting them in the fatal beef Wellington\\nShe then, one by one, denied intentionally killing her relatives\\nAlmost without pause, the prosecution, led by Nanette Rogers SC, then began their cross examination:\\nMs Patterson denied, in a rapid series of questions, that she disposed of evidence because she knew that she had used death cap mushrooms in the lunch\\nShe said she had previously hidden mushrooms in food \"to get extra vegetables into my kids\\' bodies\"\\nShe denied that a photo of mushrooms - which the prosecution proposes were death caps - shows she was calculating a fatal dose of death cap mushrooms\\nHer estranged husband Simon Patterson would have been served beef Wellington if he came to the lunch, Ms Patterson said, \"but not one with death cap mushrooms in it, intentionally\"\\nMs Patterson admitted to foraging mushrooms in the weeks before the lunch', 'location': 'AUS', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Erin Patterson denies murder in mushroom trial\\nENTITIES: Erin Patterson, Don Patterson, Gail Patterson, Ian Wilkinson, Nanette Rogers, Simon Patterson\\nEVENT: Erin Patterson continued to give evidence in her trial, denying intentionally poisoning her relatives with death cap mushrooms and lying about having cancer to lure them to a fatal lunch.\\nCONTEXT: The trial is expected to continue for several more weeks, focusing on financial disagreements and alleged lies about cancer.', 'createdAt': '2025-06-05T08:04:47.658Z'}, {'id': 107604, 'sourceId': 12486, 'url': 'https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/todays-nyt-mini-crossword-answers-for-thursday-june-5/#ftag=CADf328eec', 'title': \"Today's NYT Mini Crossword Answers for Thursday, June 5\", 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T02:18:00.000Z', 'content': \"Looking for\\xa0the most recent\\xa0Mini Crossword answer?\\xa0Click here for today's Mini Crossword hints, as well as our daily answers and hints for The New York Times Wordle, Strands, Connections and Connections: Sports Edition puzzles.Today's\\xa0NYT Mini Crossword\\xa0could be tricky. 1-Across and 7-Across really threw me, and I had to wait till other answers filled in those letters to guess the full answers.

Currently, their household must earn less than £7,400 a year to qualify.The government says the change will make 500,000 more pupils eligible, which the prime minister said would \"help families who need it most\". Labour has faced scrutiny over plans to tackle child poverty, and is yet to decide whether to scrap the two-child benefit cap.Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson told the BBC ministers were \"working as quickly as we can\" on next year\\'s plans to extend free school meals.Ministers said the changes to free school meals would save parents £500 a year and \"lift 100,000 children out of poverty\".On the two-child benefit cap, which prevents most families from claiming means-tested benefits for any third or additional children born after April 2017, Phillipson was asked if there were plans to change this policy.The education secretary told BBC Breakfast it was not a \"silver bullet\" but \"it was on the table.\" She has previously said the government is looking at scrapping it but that it would cost a lot of money.On free school meals, the Department for Education has set aside £1bn to fund the change up to 2029.They have also pledged £13m to a dozen food charities across England to \"fight food poverty\", by redistributing food from farms. Sir Keir Starmer said: \"Feeding more children every day, for free, is one of the biggest interventions we can make to put more money in parents\\' pockets, tackle the stain of poverty, and set children up to learn.\"The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank said that while the rule change would cut child poverty to a degree and would be cheaper than making free school meals universal, \"other measures - such as lifting the two-child limit - would have a lower cost per child lifted out of poverty\".Christine Farquharson, associate director of the IFS, said in a statement that today\\'s announcement would \"not see anything like 100,000 children lifted out of poverty next year\". She said protections put in place in 2018 have already increased the number of children receiving free school meals. They ensure children don\\'t lose eligibility for free school meals when their family circumstances change.The changes are due to come into effect at the start of the 2026 academic year.The announcement has been largely welcomed by the education sector and organisations campaigning against child poverty.Nick Harrison, chief executive of the Sutton Trust charity, said it was a \"significant step towards taking hunger out of the classroom\".Pepe Di\\'Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders union, said it was \"great news\".\"There is much more to be done - but this is a welcome step forward,\" he added. Kate Anstey, head of education policy at the Child Poverty Action Group, said the extension would cover \"all children in poverty and those at risk of poverty\", with the current criteria only accounting for around two-thirds of those children.She called it a \"game-changer for children and families\", but called on the government to go further.\"We hope this is a sign of what\\'s to come in the autumn\\'s child poverty strategy, with government taking more action to meet its manifesto commitment to reduce child poverty in the UK,\" she said.Liberal Democrat spokesperson Munira Wilson said: \"This can only be a first step. To end the cost of learning crisis, the government needs to commit to auto-enrolling eligible children for free school meals, lifting the two-child benefit cap, and capping uniform costs to truly change the lives of children in poverty.\"Charities have called for the two-child benefit cap to be abolished in next week\\'s spending review.The government is expected to announce its decision in the autumn, when it publishes its child poverty strategy.Sir Keir said he was \"absolutely determined that we will drive down child poverty\" during Prime Minister\\'s Questions on Wednesday.But Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch accused him of \"causing confusion\" over the policy.Who can claim free school meals?The total number of children registered for free school meals in England is about 2.1 million, or 24.6% of the total pupil population, according to the latest data. Families in England need to meet certain criteria for their children to be eligible.That can include receiving Universal Credit but, until the changes are implemented next September, parents also must have a household income of less than £7,400 a year, after tax.Parents have to apply for their children to receive them and eligible children are not automatically enrolled.In February, MPs on the cross-party education committee called for that to change.They said tens of thousands of eligible children were missing out on free school meals because their parents were not claiming them - often because of language barriers or difficulty with the administrative process.Children\\'s eligibility for free school meals varies across the UK.All primary school children in London and in Wales can access free meals.In Scotland, all children in the first five years of primary school are eligible, as well as all children from families receiving the Scottish Child Payment benefit.Parents in Northern Ireland can apply if they receive certain benefits and are below an income threshold which is approximately double the current England level, at £15,000.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

As a Conservative, of course I want taxes to be as low as possible. But that must be achieved responsibly through fiscal discipline.”The shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, will say ‘for a few weeks, we put at risk the very stability which Conservatives had always said must be carefully protected’. Photograph: James Manning/PAStride will admit that while the Tories moved swiftly to limit the damage – the main tax cut was reversed in little more than a week, Kwasi Kwarteng was sacked as chancellor within three weeks, and Truss quit six days later – the party’s standing has taken a long-term hit.“Back then mistakes were recognised and stability restored within weeks, with the full backing of our party,” he said. “But the damage to our credibility is not so easily undone. That will take time. And it also requires contrition. So let me be clear: never again will the Conservative party undermine fiscal credibility by making promises we cannot afford.”Truss hit back, releasing a statement which called Stride “one of the Conservative MPs who kowtowed to the failed Treasury orthodoxy and was set on undermining my plan for growth from the moment I beat his chosen candidate for the party leadership [Rishi Sunak]”.She added: “Until Mel Stride admits the economic failings of the last Conservative government, the British public will not trust the party with the reins of power again.”Expressing a dim view of Truss’s record is not a particularly risky stance to take, with polling shortly before she resigned showing just 11% of voters thought she was doing a good job as prime minister.

Incomes have stagnated.

It cannot and will not be reliance on America in a world of a lot of threats.'Hegseth, standing alongside NATO chief Mark Rutte, repeated calls made in February for Europe to take more involvement in defence as the US pivots east.'Every shoulder has to be to the plough,' he said. 'Every country has to contribute at that level of 5% as a recognition of the threat.'He did soften some of the rhetoric employed earlier this year, assuring allies that the US is 'proud to be here' and to 'stand with our allies', while urging NATO members to shoulder more of the financial burden.Arriving in Brussels this morning, Rutte told reporters he expects allies will 'agree on capability targets' today.'What we will do today is to decide what do we need...to defend ourselves,' he said.'So, as you know, to prepare for war, spend more.

The county, which has long been a strong seller\\'s market, might soon switch in favor of buyers.What To KnowAccording to the latest data shared by the Miami Realtors, the total number of active listings in Miami-Dade increased by 43.3 percent year-over-year in April, rising from 13,094 to 18,765. That represents significantly faster growth than the national level reported in the same month, with inventory nationwide up 20.8 percent year-over-year.However, there are still not enough homes for sale to match demand: inventory is now 18.4 percent below April 2019 levels, at 22,984.\\nSingle-family homes in a Miami residential neighborhood as seen on May 10, 2022.\\nJoe Raedle/Getty Images\\nThe inventory of single-family homes, which represents the majority of the U.S. market, increased by 43.04 percent in April compared to the same period a year earlier, rising from 3,864 to 5,527. Condo inventory rose by 43.42 percent year-over-year in the same month, for a total of 13,328 listings. Both markets have a number of homes for sale at levels below those of 2019.The market for single-family homes, despite growing inventory, remains balanced, with a 6.3-month supply. In the condo market, buyers already have the upper hand. According to Miami Realtors, there is currently a 13.7-month supply, meaning that buyers have a wide range of options to choose from and significantly more negotiating power.A balanced market between buyers and sellers is typically considered to offer a supply of between six and nine months.Sales in South Florida, however, are dwindling despite rising inventory levels. A total of 2,133 homes went under contract in Miami-Dade in April, according to Redfin, down by 19.1 percent compared to a year earlier. Those homes spent an average of 81 days on the market before being sold, up 15 days from the previous year.And yet, prices have not come down.\"The rapid price growth fueled by fierce competition during the pandemic has left home prices elevated in many areas,\" Hannah Jones, senior economic research analyst at Realtor.com, previously told Newsweek.\"With mortgage rates still high, many prospective buyers are waiting on the sidelines for homeownership to become more affordable.\"Other South Florida counties are experiencing a similar surge in inventory and declining sales. In Broward County, active listings increased by 46 percent year-over-year in April, while Palm Beach County saw a 30 percent rise. In Broward County, sales were down 16.4 percent year-over-year in the same month, according to Redfin; in Palm Beach County, they were down by 10.7 percent.Overall, South Florida\\'s housing inventory has nearly quadrupled since 2022, reaching approximately 52,000 active listings, due to a combination of several factors.In part, it is because the Sunshine State has been building more new homes than any other state in the country in recent years, spurred by the sudden surge in demand during the pandemic. In part, this is because owners who were previously locked into their homes by high mortgage rates have now given up waiting for lower monthly payments and are putting their homes on the market.Elevated mortgage rates, high home prices and rising housing costs—including homeowner association (HOA) fees and home insurance premiums—are also playing a role in the piling up of unsold inventory in the state\\'s market, keeping buyers on the sidelines. Some existing homeowners are deciding to leave the state to avoid rising costs and escape the growing threat of devastating natural disasters, as well as higher home insurance premiums.What People Are SayingHannah Jones, senior economic research analyst at Realtor.com, previously told Newsweek: \"The trajectory of home prices in Florida is dependent on the larger economic context and mortgage rates, which both impact buyer demand. Currently, many buyers are on the sidelines because still-high prices and mortgage rates have priced them out of the market.\"Affordability could improve via some combination of lower home prices and lower mortgage rates. Until buyer demand improves, it is likely that sellers in Florida will continue to reduce asking prices, hoping to spur some buyer attention.\"Miami Realtors Chairman Eddie Blanco said in a press release: \"Miami and South Florida real estate continues to be a national leader in employment, population and home price appreciation gains. These Miami fundamentals are shielding the market from macroeconomic changes: tariffs, stock market fluctuations and 7 percent mortgage rates.\"What Happens NextWhile the Sunshine State housing market is experiencing a cooldown that is likely to continue bringing prices down at the state level, the situation on the ground is slightly different in South Florida and Miami-Dade, where inventory remains below the pre-pandemic level.Despite the threat of hurricanes hovering over the region, Miami-Dade also remains a relatively strong market, thanks to the pull of Miami, which is growing as a tech hub, attracting new residents, investments, and a larger workforce.At the same time, the region\\'s condo market is still being affected by new building safety legislation, which came into effect at the end of 2024 and has increased HOA fees for owners, prompting many to put their properties on the market despite a lack of buyers.', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: South Florida Home Inventory Surges, Sales Dwindle\\nENTITIES: Miami-Dade County, South Florida, Redfin, Miami Realtors, Hannah Jones, Realtor.com, Eddie Blanco\\nEVENT: South Florida's housing inventory has nearly doubled, with Miami-Dade seeing a 43% increase in for-sale homes in April, while sales are down nearly 20%.\\nCONTEXT: Rising inventory and declining sales suggest a market correction despite elevated prices.\", 'createdAt': '2025-06-05T08:04:47.658Z'}, {'id': 106465, 'sourceId': 12361, 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/05/business/on-a-search-for-an-old-ev-jay-lenos-car-obsession-came-up-clutch.html', 'title': 'Jay Leno’s Baker Electric, a Relic from the Electric Vehicle Past', 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T07:00:05.000Z', 'content': 'AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTYou have a preview view of this article while we are checking your access.

A century ago, roughly a third of taxi drivers in New York City shuttled passengers around in electric cars.I set out to write an article about these cars, and a time before lawmakers gave deference to the oil industry by offering numerous tax breaks, paving the way for gasoline-powered vehicles. But finding an original E.V. that I could ride in proved difficult. Most of them sit in museums and personal collections.Enter the comedian — and car collector — Jay Leno.My editor suggested I reach out to Mr. Leno after learning about his 1909 Baker Electric, housed in his famous garage. Mr. Leno’s team gave an enthusiastic “Yes” in reply.When I arrived at his warehouse garage in Burbank, Calif., in April, Mr. Leno had his Baker Electric charged and ready to hit the streets. The 116-year-old car, which had been refurbished, looked like it had just rolled off the showroom floor.Still, the wooden high-top body, 36-inch rubber wheels and Victorian-style upholstery whispered the car’s age. It was basically a carriage with batteries, enabling drivers to free horses from their bits and harnesses.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

It was so cathartic and so painful, and I regret that. I really do.”Walton later added: “There is no feud. I adore, I love this woman madly, and she is so important to me.“[She] is Goldie Hawn. [She] is Meg Ryan. She can do anything, and she will. You watch what the next 20 years of her experience will be.”“We care about each other very deeply,” he added.The Emmy nominee also said that he’d chosen not to dispel the feud reports during a now-infamous interview with The Times because he didn’t want to “speak for both of us” when Aimee wasn’t present.Similarly, she chose to remain schtum on the “feud” reports until now because she felt anything she said would be misconstrued, instead opting to “sit back and watch these people making something out of absolutely nothing”.Walton Goggins and Aimee Lou Wood in the final episode of The White Lotus season threeHBOAs for his unfollowing Aimee on Instagram, Walton put this down to wanting to put some distance between himself and The White Lotus once the show was over.“I knew what we had gone through, and I knew how close that we had gotten, and I needed to begin to process saying goodbye to Rick and Chelsea,” he said, apparently beginning to tear up.“And I knew that that was going to take a while for me, so I let her know, this is what I’ve gotta do. And she was extremely supportive about that.”It’s noted in Variety’s piece that Walton had more of a personal connection to Thailand than most of the rest of the cast, as he went travelling near where The White Lotus was filmed years earlier after his first wife died by suicide.Branding the media furore “ridiculous”, he concluded: “I’m emotional because we haven’t been in the same city to ever talk about this. So for me, this is just so wonderful.”Variety noted that the interview took place on the first weekend of May, shortly before both actors walked the red carpet separately at this year’s Met Gala.Since then, Walton’s wife Nadia Conners has also spoken out about rumours of an affair between her husband and his White Lotus co-star, which she took in good humour.Read Walton Goggins and Aimee Lou Wood’s full interview in Variety here.', 'location': 'N/A', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Goggins and Wood Deny 'White Lotus' Feud\\nENTITIES: Walton Goggins, Aimee Lou Wood, The White Lotus, Variety, Nadia Conners\\nEVENT: Walton Goggins and Aimee Lou Wood addressed rumors of a feud stemming from unfollowing each other on Instagram after filming 'The White Lotus', attributing it to needing space to process the show's end and denying any actual conflict.\\nCONTEXT: Actors address rumors of a feud after show.\", 'createdAt': '2025-06-05T08:04:47.658Z'}, {'id': 103874, 'sourceId': 919, 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/05/english-speaking-countries-more-nervous-about-rise-of-ai-polls-suggest', 'title': 'English-speaking countries more nervous about rise of AI, polls suggest', 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T06:00:02.000Z', 'content': 'People in English-speaking countries including the UK, US, Australia and Canada are more nervous about the rise of artificial intelligence than those in the largest EU economies, where excitement over its spread is higher, new research suggests.A global split over what has been dubbed “the wonder and worry” of AI appears to correlate with widely divergent levels of trust in governments to regulate the fast-developing technology.The polling of 23,000 adults in 30 countries, shared exclusively with the Guardian by Ipsos Mori, also showed a quarter of people globally still do not have a good understanding of what AI is, despite it being widely described as the most transformative technology in decades.On Wednesday, Abba’s Björn Ulvaeus revealed he was writing a musical with the assistance of AI, describing it as “like having another songwriter in the room with a huge reference frame”.Britons appear to be among the world’s most worried people about the rise of AI, with two-thirds of people in Great Britain saying they are nervous about the technology being deployed in products and services, and less than half trusting the UK government to regulate AI responsibly.By contrast half or less than half of people in France, Germany and Italy said products and services using AI made them nervous.“In the Anglosphere (US, Great Britain, Canada and Ireland and Australia) there is much more nervousness than excitement,” said Matt Carmichael, a senior vice-president at Ipsos Mori. “In European markets we see less nervousness, but also just a mid-range of excitement. Some markets are much more positive than nervous, especially in south-east Asia.”Only Americans, Japanese people and Hungarians trust their governments less to regulate AI than Britons. The UK government recently delayed a bill intended to regulate AI companies in order to align itself with the stance of Donald Trump’s administration in the US.Trust in government regulation is lowest in the US, where the president’s election campaign was bankrolled by Silicon Valley technology oligarchs including Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and he recently proposed a bill preventing new state-led regulations of AI.By contrast last June, the European Union passed the bloc-wide EU AI Act, which bans AI that poses an “unacceptable risk”, for example, systems used for social scoring, and requires systems to declare when AI has been used to manipulate or generate content.People in India, where the use of misleading AI-generated deepfake videos marked last year’s general election campaign, are also among the most nervous about AI being used in products and services.The polling also revealed widespread opposition to AI’s use in creating news articles, films and adverts but an equal acceptance that AI will become the primary producer of these things anyway.The highest levels of excitement about AI were found in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand where levels of trust in government regulation were also highest. Polling in those countries was only representative of the more “connected” urban and educated populations but it showed almost double the levels of excitement as in the whole populations of the US and Great Britain.People in Great Britain were among the most pessimistic about how AI will worsen the job market, with nearly a third fearing AI will replace them entirely at work.Globally, just 31% of people think the job market in their country will improve because of AI and 35% think it will get worse. But perception of its impact varied widely. Nearly three-quarters of people in Thailand believe it is very or somewhat likely that AI will replace their current job in the next five years, compared with only 14% who believe their job will go in Sweden and one in four in the US, Great Britain and Australia.Across all 30 countries, the polling showed very few people want AI created-online news articles, films or adverts, but most people think it is likely AI will become the primary producer of all of these things as well as making television programmes, screening job adverts and even creating realistic sports content such as tennis matches between AI-generated players.Carmichael said this could play out either with increasing public acceptance as AI-generated content becomes more widespread or alternatively a “backlash”.Some of that resistance is currently being seen with the campaign by musicians in the UK, including Kate Bush and Elton John, for greater protections against copyright infringement by technology companies building large language models (LLMs).

Luckily, there are some fantastic solutions that can really help keep your glow and your vitality.Georgia Louise shares her advice for caring for midlife skin\"You are going to need a richer cream. They are generally all marketed as antiaging cream, but they are catering to skin that is also going through perimenopause. During the day look for antioxidant rich creams that are full of collagen peptides that are really going to help support your skin. Also look for peptides and retinols in your night cream.\"Other superstar ingredients include hyaluronic acid, which can hold up to 1,000 times its weight in water, making it brilliant for plumping. I like to spritz my face with real water to make my skin slightly damp before applying, which ensures I really lock the moisture in.Niacinamide\\xa0is another hero ingredient in midlife, as it supports the skin barrier and reduces inflammation. It even things out and basically keeps your face from freaking out. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0Some experts might tell you that a cream is better than a serum or vice versa, but the most important thing is to find a product that works for you. If creams tend to clog your pores, then grab a serum instead. Find a routine that is easy for you to make into a twice-daily habit.© InstagramGeorgia Louise shares how her skin is faring in perimenopauseOne word of warning. Perimenopause can cause your skin to become extra sensitive, even if you have never reacted badly to an ingredient before. For that reason, I\\'d skip anything too heavily perfumed.\\xa0Moisturize morning and night, and if you\\'re feeling extra dry, keep a hydrating spritz in your bag.

German officials say the two leaders have started to build a “decent” relationship, with Merz wanting to avoid the antagonism that defined Trump\\'s relationship with one of his predecessors, Angela Merkel, in Trump\\'s first term. The 69-year-old Merz is a conservative former rival of Merkel\\'s who took over her party after she retired from politics. Merz also comes to office with an extensive business background — something that could align him with Trump.A White House official said topics that Trump is likely to raise with Merz include Germany’s defense spending, trade, Ukraine and what the official called “democratic backsliding,\" saying the administration\\'s view is that shared values such as freedom of speech have deteriorated in Germany and the country should reverse course. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the discussions.Merz will want to avoid an Oval Office showdown of the kind that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa experienced in recent months. Asked about the risk of a White House blow-up, Merz spokesperson Stefan Kornelius said on Monday that the chancellor is “well-prepared” for the meeting and that he and Trump have “built up a decent relationship, at least by phone\" and via text messaging. Merz has thrown himself into diplomacy on Ukraine, traveling to Kyiv with fellow European leaders days after taking office and receiving Zelenskyy in Berlin last week. He has thanked Trump for his support for an unconditional ceasefire while rejecting the idea of “dictated peace” or the “subjugation” of Ukraine and advocating for more sanctions against Russia.The White House official said Trump on Thursday will stress that direct peace talks must continue. In their first phone call since Merz became chancellor, Trump said he would support the efforts of Germany and other European countries to achieve peace, according to a readout from the German government. Merz also said last month that “it is of paramount importance that the political West not let itself be divided, so I will continue to make every effort to produce the greatest possible unity between the European and American partners.”Under Merz\\'s immediate predecessor, Olaf Scholz, Germany became the second-biggest supplier of military aid to Ukraine after the United States. Merz has vowed to keep up the support and last week pledged to help Ukraine develop its own long-range missile systems that would be free of any range limits.At home, Merz\\'s government is intensifying a drive that Scholz started to bolster the German military after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In Trump\\'s first term, Berlin was a target of his ire for failing to meet the current NATO target of spending 2% of gross domestic product on defense, and Trump is now demanding at least 5% from allies. The White House official said the upcoming NATO summit in the Netherlands later this month is a “good opportunity” for Germany to commit to meeting that 5% mark. Scholz set up a 100 billion euro ($115 billion) special fund to modernize Germany\\'s armed forces — called the Bundeswehr — which had suffered from years of neglect. Germany has met the 2% target thanks to the fund, but it will be used up in 2027.Merz has said that “the government will in the future provide all the financing the Bundeswehr needs to become the strongest conventional army in Europe.” He has endorsed a plan for all allies to aim to spend 3.5% of GDP on their defense budgets by 2032, plus an extra 1.5% on potentially defense-related things like infrastructure.Another top priority for Merz is to get Germany\\'s economy, Europe\\'s biggest, moving again after it shrank the past two years. He wants to make it a “locomotive of growth,” but Trump\\'s tariff threats are a potential obstacle for a country whose exports have been a key strength. At present, the economy is forecast to stagnate in 2025.Germany exported $160 billion worth of goods to the U.S. last year, according to the Census Bureau. That was about $85 billion more than what the U.S. sent to Germany, a trade deficit that Trump wants to erase.The U.S. president has specifically gone after the German auto sector, which includes major brands such as Audi, BMW, Mercedes Benz, Porsche and Volkswagen. Americans bought $36 billion worth of cars, trucks and auto parts from Germany last year, while the Germans purchased $10.2 billion worth of vehicles and parts from the U.S.Trump’s 25% tariff on autos and parts is specifically designed to increase the cost of German-made automobiles in hopes of causing them to move their factories to the U.S., even though many of the companies already have plants in the U.S. with Volkswagen in Tennessee, BMW in South Carolina and Mercedes-Benz in Alabama and South Carolina.There’s only so much Merz can achieve on his view that tariffs “benefit no one and damage everyone” while in Washington, as trade negotiations are a matter for the European Union’s executive commission. Trump recently delayed a planned 50% tariff on goods coming from the European Union, which would have otherwise gone into effect this month. One source of strain in recent months is a speech Vice President JD Vance gave in Munich shortly before Germany\\'s election in February, in which he lectured European leaders about the state of democracy on the continent and said there is no place for “firewalls.” That term is frequently used to describe mainstream German parties\\' refusal to work with the far-right Alternative for Germany, which finished second in the election and is now the biggest opposition party.Merz criticized the comments. He told ARD television last month that it isn\\'t the place of a U.S. vice president “to say something like that to us in Germany; I wouldn\\'t do it in America, either.”___Moulson reported from Berlin.

Pernell and his friends were setting up their barbecues for a traditional Fourth of July get-together when the men jumped a fence and announced a robbery.The investigation went nowhere until 2019, when a witness told police they should look at a man named Kavon Young.John Pernell.NBC WashingtonAccording to a document filed in D.C. Superior Court, police said DNA discovered under Pernell’s fingernails matched the DNA profile of Young. The probability the DNA did not belong to Young was one in 3.4 billion in the United States African American population.But that DNA evidence — presented in court as a match in 2019 — suddenly became a mismatch two days before trial. Prosecutors at the U.S. Attorney’s Office, the defense attorneys and the private lab that did the original testing will not say why.“It’s shameful. We have a right to know what happened,” said Pernell’s daughter, Yolanda Pernell-Vogelson.Two days before the trial was set to begin, Pernell-Vogelson and her sister, Ayana Pernell, say they got a call from Michael Spence, the prosecutor in the case, who told them the initial calculations were wrong.“To this day, [we] have not been given a full, understandable explanation as to why this has happened,” Ayana Pernell said. “I mean, we are essentially victims also.”Court records show the private lab that did the testing, Bode Technology Group Inc., lost the evidence and it cannot be retested. The judge told the prosecution and defense that at trial, the jury would be told “the government’s labs and/or agencies negligently lost the DNA extract in this case” just before the trial was set to begin.In an April 9 filing, prosecutors noted again the DNA “matched the defendant” “as reported by Bode Technology” — a result prosecutors relied upon for five-and-a-half years until deciding two days before trial it was unreliable.Bode Technology group declined to comment. Young was released in April, and NBC Washington couldn’t reach the attorneys who have been representing him.Pernell’s daughters said they wrote letters to all lawmakers in the city.“We extend our condolences to Mr. Pernell’s family and friends, including his daughters,\" Washington Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Lindsey Appiah said in a statement Wednesday. \"I’ve contacted them regarding his case, and we are investigating the matter to see if there is anything additional the District can do to be of assistance to ensure justice.”', 'location': 'N/A', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Murder case dismissed due to lost DNA\\nENTITIES: John Pernell, Kavon Young, Bode Technology Group Inc., U.S. Attorney’s Office\\nEVENT: A murder case in Washington was dismissed after DNA evidence, initially matching the defendant, was lost by a private lab.

A rapidly expanding petition on the parliamentary website has garnered 63,000 signatures demanding reforms.As it stands, individuals over 60 in Scotland, NI and Wales benefit from complimentary bus travel. In England, however, only certain areas like Merseyside and London offer this perk due to local authorities lacking funds.The petition, accessible here, with 63,285 supporters states: \"We call on the Government to extend free bus travel to all people over 60 years old in England outside London. We believe the current situation is unjust and we want equality for everyone over 60.\"It further argues: \"Currently, people in England who do not live in London are not entitled to free bus travel until they reach the state pension age, which we believe has changed dramatically.

No assessment has been made of the potential impact of lowering the age on social inclusion, the economy or the environment.\"Emphasising the versatility within local governance, he added: \"Local authorities in England have the power to offer concessions in addition to their statutory obligations such as lowering the age of eligibility.

Voters have a chance to send Farage packing today and they should embrace this opportunity with gusto. Crisis on wards Scotland's NHS is in need of some major surgery to make it fit for purpose. And in reforming our health service, the Scottish Government could do a lot worse than listening to the frontline workers who save lives every day. Today, the Daily Record reports on concerns from NHS cancer specialists over staff shortages causing massive waiting times for diagnosis and treatment. The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) describes the situation as a “ticking time bomb”, with further shortages expected in the next five years. With so many families affected by cancer, it is vital we have enough trained medics to get people treated quickly. We all know early detection can be a life saver. Nobody should have to wait for treatment knowing every passing day could see their condition getting worse. There are no silver bullets that will fix our health service – which is in desperate need of resources and reform. But listening to warnings from frontline medics is vital to any solution.

League now looks a possibility, with TYC Sports in Argentina claiming that United are once again interested in Martinez.They claim that the Red Devils actually made initial contact over potentially sealing a deal for the World Cup winner back during the January transfer window.Getty Images\\n2 hours agoRangers appoint Russell Martin as new managerRangers have officially now appointed Russell Martin as their new manager.The former Scotland international defender has signed a three-year contract at Ibrox as the permanent successor to Philippe Clement, who was sacked back in February as club legend Barry Ferguson was placed in interim charge.Steven Gerrard had been linked with a sensational return to Rangers in addition to the likes of Carlo Ancelotti’s son Davide, but it’s former MK Dons and Swansea boss Martin who has got the job, having been out of work since being sacked by Southampton in December after their Premier League promotion quickly turned into a nightmare.\\n2 hours agoMan Utd must pay over £60m for Bryan MbeumoManchester United must increase their offer for new top target Bryan Mbeumo.Reports emerged last night that the Reds had tabled an opening bid for the Cameroon forward worth an initial £45m plus a further £10m in add-ons.However, that number was said to fall below Brentford’s valuation of Mbeumo as negotiations continue between the two clubs.Now The Telegraph report that United will need to move beyond the £60m mark with their next offer for the 25-year-old, who scored 20 goals in 42 appearances across all competitions this season.Getty

replaced the Real Madrid-bound Trent Alexander-Arnold with Jeremie Frimpong on the right side of defence, they are now prioritising a long-term successor to Andy Robertson at left-back.Kerkez has been their top target in that regard, with talks having been ongoing with Bournemouth for a while.According to TEAMtalk, the Reds are now on the verge of clinching a £50m deal for the Hungarian international, who will join compatriot and close friend Dominik Szoboszlai at Anfield.The two clubs are said to be ironing out the final details of the transfer, with Kostas Tsimikas expected to be sold after Kerkez’s arrival.REUTERS\\n2 hours agoChelsea in talks over signing Hugo Ekitike Chelsea are said to be in talks to sign another new striker in Hugo Ekitike.On Wednesday night the Blues finally announced the arrival of Liam Delap, having triggered the England Under-21 international’s £30m relegation release clause at Ipswich.But the Conference League winners evidently want more firepower in soon ahead of this month’s Club World Cup.According to Sky Germany, Chelsea have now made initial contact with Eintracht Frankfurt over Ekitike, who is also wanted by Liverpool.However, they will apparently have to pay a huge fee of €100m in order to make a deal happen.Getty Images\\n3 hours agoFlorian Wirtz agrees huge Liverpool dealLiverpool are expected to reach an agreement over the blockbuster signing of Florian Wirtz soon, reports claim.So far the Reds have seen two substantial offers for the German forward rejected by Bayer Leverkusen, the second totalling a club-record £109m including add-ons and bonuses.Leverkusen are said to be holding out for around £125m for their top asset, while there were rumours that they were looking to also receive either Jarell Quansah or Harvey Elliott as part of the deal.According to German outlet BILD, Wirtz has already agreed a bumper five-year contract at Anfield that will pay him in the region of £200,000 a week.The 22-year-old played and scored for Germany in their home Nations League semi-final defeat by Portugal in Munich last night.Getty Images\", 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT',

Chung & Cara Delevingne\", 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T07:46:39.000Z', 'content': 'Festival season is under way and we’re prepping hard. And just in time Burberry’s hot new campaign has landed, which is as star-studded as Kate Moss’s 2005 Glastonbury Rocks belt. Set in the muddy fields of a rural wonderland, it features Goldie, Cara Delevingne, Alexa Chung, Seungmin, Loyle Carner, Chy Cartier, John Glacier, plus Liam Gallagher and his children — Lennon, Gene and Molly Moorish — in various scenes of festival merriment.Alexa Chung BurberryChung is a diamond in the mud, clad in pink sequins and Burberry wellies, while Carner disguises his fame behind a high-neck collar. Liam Gallagher is backstage beside a Winnebago (this surely isn’t going to help those Glastonbury rumours) while his offspring are dotted among the tents and revellers. Cara DelevingneBurberryGlastonbury, the mother of all festivals, opens in three weeks’ time, so if this has you wondering which fashion tribe you want to be a part of, we’re way ahead of you. GoldieBurberryWhether it’s one day only or a full weekend in the forest, we break down some of the major trends for 2025, plus who to put on your moodboard. These are the looks to know, whether you want to go boho, gorpy, or full Kate Moss.Gorpmeister 3000Cecilie Bahnsen FW25Cecilie BahnsenDo you hear that? It’s the sound of everyone in east London tightening the strings of their Salomon XT-6 trainers, ready for festival season. In case you aren’t familiar with the concept of gorpcore, gorp derives from the “Good Old Raisins and Peanuts” trail mix snack, and gorpcore is the kind of clothing you’d wear on said trails. Arc’teryx, North Face, Maharishi, Gramicci. It looks a little silly on the streets of London, but it actually doubles up very well for festival gear. Fred Again and his fishing vest may have been right all along. Handily, you can adopt this style for free by nabbing your uncle’s old North Face. Voila!The Kate Moss impersonatorKate Moss attends Glastonbury 2005Getty ImagesSuch is the obsession with Moss’s old festival looks that many have taken to straight-up impersonating her, instead of simply using her as inspiration. You’ll know them when you see them: a flash of gold chainmail, a belt worn around the hips with no practical purpose, a waistcoat with mini shorts and wellies, always. Mossy is also well known for her fondness for leopard print, which is sure to have a revival this year, with Depop searches for “animal print” up 1,947 per cent since March.Boho babeChloé SS25Courtesy of ChloéOh, you thought boho was dead? Chemena Kamali, the new creative director of Chloé, would like a word. Sure, it might be a little silly to wear her £825 transparent Maxine wedges and £10,159 lace dresses to a festival, but Kamali is single-handedly reviving boho chic. She’s had a little help from Sienna Miller, reigning festival fashion queen, who’s sure to be repping some sort of Chloé garment with her wellies this Glastonbury. If in doubt, add a trailing sliver of lace to your look, or a silk chemise. Just make sure it doesn’t go anywhere near the long drops.Biker girlOlivia Dean performs at Glastonbury 2024Getty ImagesThe geniuses among us have worked out that biker boots essentially function the same as wellies, so they’re perfect for anyone looking to add a dash of punk to their festival look. Leather and plaid garments will be big this year, with many taking inspiration from the belted leather mini dress Dua Lipa wore to perform at Glastonbury last year, or Olivia Dean’s patchwork plaid look by Chopova Lowena. Get digging through the shops for anything tartan, leather, belted or buckled. If in doubt, check out Martine Rose’s SS25 collection.Oversized everythingBillie EilishGetty Images for The Recording AYou’d be forgiven for confusing these individuals with the very tents they’re camping in, because everything they wear is three sizes too big. Think Billie Eilish and her baggy shorts, baggy shirts and boyish accessories — ties, baseball caps, the lot. Depop has observed a 100 per cent increase in searches for camo jorts, so you’ll be blending in in more ways than one.Back to basicsHailey Bieber attends Coachella 2025Hailey Bieber via InstagramIf you’ve been charting the evolution of festival fashion via the likes of Hailey Bieber and Kylie Jenner at Coachella, you’ll have noticed it has been scaled back from colourful maximalism to monochrome minimalism in recent years. There’s a heavy focus on basics: white vests, denim cargo trousers, black mini dresses. It’s finished off with an oversized jacket and one or two key accessories, such as a Yankees cap or a pair of sleek sunglasses. Get yourself a reliable white vest and use it as your festival staple, building outfits around it. Rhode lip balm case optional.The coquetteClairo performs at Coachella 2025Getty Images for CoachellaWhile we really wouldn’t advise donning any kind of ballet flat for a festival, expect to see plenty of coquettish looks from the ankle up. The British crowd will have undoubtedly taken inspiration from Charli xcx and Clairo’s Coachella looks, which featured silk, pearls and polka dots, as well as a rogue Lou Reed tee from Charli, which helped keep things a little more grungey.The semi-pro athleteWales Bonner SS25Wales BonnerThis person rowed at Harvard, played rugby at Loughborough and could have gone pro for Arsenal if they hadn’t hurt their knee. Or at least that’s what their outfit would have you think. As blokecore reaches fever pitch and people attempt to wear actual football boots (yes, with the studs) out on the streets of London, the festival summer will be populated with wannabe athletes in a Frankenstein’s mishmash of sports clothes. Just don’t rely on them to jog between stages —they don’t have the lung capacity.Trending\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Burberry's festival campaign features celebrities, trends\\nENTITIES: Burberry, Liam Gallagher, Alexa Chung, Cara Delevingne, Kate Moss, Goldie, Loyle Carner, Chy Cartier, John Glacier, Lennon Gallagher, Gene Gallagher, Molly Moorish, Chemena Kamali, Sienna Miller, Dua Lipa, Olivia Dean, Billie Eilish, Hailey Bieber, Kylie Jenner, Charli xcx, Clairo, Wales Bonner\\nEVENT: Burberry launches a star-studded festival campaign featuring celebrities in various festival-inspired looks, coinciding with the upcoming Glastonbury festival.

With a brand new Mario Kart game to enjoy and countless other titles in the Switch's extensive back-catalogue, it's set to be an exciting weekend ahead for many gamers.While the Nintendo Switch 2 console is of course the main event, you can enhance your experience by picking up a few accessories alongside your new gadget. Some will make gaming in docked mode much more pleasurable, while others will help to keep your £400 console safe during its lifetime.I've rounded up some of the best accessories you can purchase for the Nintendo Switch 2 right now, along with the best prices. Find all the details below:Nintendo Switch 2 Carrying Case & Screen Protector - £20.99Nintendo Switch 2 Carrying Case & Screen Protector - £20.99(Image: Nintendo)The Nintendo Switch 2 is a hybrid console, meaning it can either be played docked to a TV or portably in handheld mode. Despite handheld mode being a tentpole of the Switch 2's design, Nintendo doesn't actually supply you with a carry case by default.That means if you want to take the Switch 2 out and about, you run the risk of it getting damaged by just throwing it in a bag and hoping for the best. To ensure your brand new console stays safe, it's worth investing in a carry case and screen protector.Nintendo sells an official carrying case on its site, which also comes with a screen protector for good measure. It's simple in its design with a blacked out colour scheme aside from some blue and red accents on the zips.There's also room to carry up to six game cartridges in the case at the same time, letting you bring up to seven games on the go with you if you count one installed in the system itself. Best of all, it doesn't really break the bank coming in at £20.99 from the official Nintendo Store.Click here to add the Nintendo Switch 2 Carrying Case & Screen Protector to your basket.Nintendo Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip - £29.95Nintendo Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip - £29.95(Image: Amazon)You can get away with using the set of Joy-Cons that the Nintendo Switch 2 comes with, especially since the console comes with a grip to insert them into to turn them into a more traditional controller. However, that included grip is missing one hugely important feature - it doesn't let you charge the Joy-Cons while in use.This is especially disappointing if you're someone who enjoys longer gaming sessions as running out of charge means you'll need to dock them directly onto the console. You can get around this issue by picking up this Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip, which lets you plug in a USB C cable to provide power to the Joy-Cons while without interrupting a gaming session.What's more, this grip adds an additional two back grip buttons to the controllers which can be mapped to any other button you like. This will be especially useful for those who enjoy competitive games, or who particularly hate having to take their thumbs off the sticks to press certain buttons.Click here to add the Nintendo Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip to your basket.Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller - £74.95Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller - £74.95(Image: Amazon)For players who intend to play their Nintendo Switch 2 almost entirely in docked mode, it's worth picking up the new Pro Controller that's releasing alongside the new console. It adds those additional back paddle buttons while providing a more traditional controller layout and grip.It also comes equipped with an audio jack at the bottom which lets you plug in headphones to the controller and listen to your game without disturbing those around you. An NFC connection is located in here too, letting you scan Amiibo for unique in-game rewards.Click here to add the Nintendo Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip to your basket.Nintendo Switch 2 Camera - £49Nintendo Switch 2 Camera - £49(Image: Amazon)The Nintendo Switch 2 Camera is a brand new addition for this console, allowing you to show your face to friends while playing games online. This functionality is now baked into the consoles software, with it using clever trickery to cut your face out from the background and layer it over in-game elements, like your kart in Mario Kart or games in Super Mario Party.It's certainly a unique use of the gadget and will mostly benefit those who enjoy playing their Switch 2 online. If this sounds like your cup of tea though, it can be picked up for £49.99.Click here to add the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera to your basket. There's also an adorable Piranha Plant version, although this has a lower camera resolution.ProCase 2 Pack Joy-Con Controller Hand Grips - £13.58ProCase 2 Pack Joy-Con Controller Hand Grips - £13.58(Image: Amazon)While you can use the Joy-Con 2 controllers individually, they are a little on the small side and cause hand cramp if used in this way for a long period of time. If you're someone who's likely to be playing a lot of two-player Mario Kart, it might be worth picking up some of these grips to make the experience a little more pleasurable.The Joy-Cons slot into the grips seamlessly, creating a much larger grip for you to hold that's far more ergonomic in the hand.

This classic is popular in Hong Kong, as well as among Chinese-speaking communities in Asia and beyond. Since then, numerous courtroom thrillers involving juries have been produced, many achieving success at the box office.The jury system is a common feature of many common law systems, although it has been abolished in some jurisdictions such as Singapore.Introduced in Hong Kong in 1845, the jury system has in effect been in operation for more than 175 years. Its importance and widespread acceptance are underscored by Article 86 of the Basic Law, which states: “The principle of trial by jury previously practised in Hong Kong shall be maintained.”Juries are mainly used in criminal trials for more serious offences tried in the Court of First Instance. The essential function of a jury is to determine the relevant facts of a case from the evidence presented in court and to apply the law as directed by the judge. The judge addresses points of law and jurors assess the facts, applying their common sense and life experience to determine the truthfulness of witness testimony.The jury system allows members of the community to participate in the criminal justice process, bringing their perspectives and experiences. It also plays a pivotal role in maintaining public confidence and legitimacy in the criminal justice system, as jurors gain first-hand insight into the operation of the justice system through their participation.Of course, it must be recognised that for historical reasons – as trials in Hong Kong were conducted solely in English and the English-speaking population was relatively small – the vast majority of criminal offences in Hong Kong have been tried in the Magistrates’ Court and the District Court, where there are no juries, and yet sentences can be up to seven years.', 'location': 'HKG', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Hong Kong Maintains Jury System Under Basic Law\\nENTITIES: Hong Kong, Andy Lau Tak-wah, Singapore, Basic Law, Court of First Instance, Magistrates’ Court, District Court\\nEVENT: Hong Kong's jury system, introduced in 1845 and protected by Article 86 of the Basic Law, is primarily used in criminal trials in the Court of First Instance, allowing citizens to participate in the justice system.\\nCONTEXT: The jury system is a cornerstone of Hong Kong's legal framework, ensuring public participation and confidence in the justice system.\", 'createdAt': '2025-06-05T08:04:47.658Z'}, {'id': 104592, 'sourceId': 904, 'url': 'https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/film/mark-wahlberg-pacific-peru-australia-scottish-b1231346.html', 'title': 'Mark Wahlberg tells Scots brothers their Pacific rowing bid ‘could be a movie’', 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T06:14:02.000Z', 'content': 'Three Scottish brothers aiming to become the fastest people to row across the Pacific have received a surprise video call from Hollywood actor Mark Wahlberg, who told them their record-breaking bid “could be a movie”.The Perfect Storm star spoke to Ewan, Jamie and Lachlan Maclean 54 days into their bid to row 9,000 miles non-stop and unsupported from Lima, Peru to Sydney, Australia.As well as aiming to set a record for the fastest row across the world’s largest ocean, the brothers are hoping to raise £1 million for clean water projects in Madagascar.Wahlberg told the brothers that he was “so inspired” by their undertaking, which has seen them battle salt sores, relentless weather and broken equipment during more than seven weeks at sea.“You’re badasses doing something no one else would think of”, he told them.“This could be a movie. The best films I’ve done are based on true stories – ordinary people doing extraordinary things.“No way I’d row an ocean, but I’d play one of you guys in a movie.”He added: “What you guys are doing is next level. You’re living out a sense of purpose – combining passion with impact.“That’s rare, and it’s humbling to watch. People need to hear about what you’re doing.”Ewan Maclean told the actor that speaking to him from the middle of the Pacific was “probably the most surreal situation I’ve ever been in”.Lachlan added: “We’re operating on such little sleep that we thought it could all have been a hallucination.”Wahlberg responded that he “couldn’t be more inspired by the grit, the determination, the resiliency” that the brothers were showing.The Maclean brothers described speaking to Mark Wahlberg from the middle of the Pacific Ocean as “surreal” (The Maclean Brothers/PA)PA MediaHe continued: “What you guys are doing for such an amazing cause, and how hard you’re willing to sacrifice yourself and your own wellbeing for the good of others, is so inspiring.“For you guys to do this under your own free will – it’s pretty crazy. Some would say we might need to give you a couple of psychological examinations.”Wahlberg, who owns restaurants in Sydney and the Gold Coast, also told the brothers he would “have a meal waiting for you” at the finish line.Asked about conditions so far, Ewan replied that “it’s been much harder than expected”, but that earlier that day they had seen “dolphins surfing near the boat, and that lifted our spirits”.Wahlberg quipped: “You guys are probably getting a lot more sunshine than you’re used to at home.”He added: “I’ve been fortunate enough to visit a couple of times and it’s a beautiful, beautiful country.

It's the 16th straight year of decline.It's about one-quarter of the peak of 2.7 million births in 1949 during the postwar baby boom.The data in a country of rapidly aging and shrinking population adds to concern about the sustainability of the economy and national security at a time it seeks to increase defense spending.Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has described the situation as “a silent emergency” and has promised to promote more flexible working environment and other measures that would help married couples to balance work and parenting, especially in rural areas where family values tend to be more conservative and harder on women. Japan is one of a number of east Asian countries grappling with falling birth rates and an aging population. South Korea and China have fought for years to encourage families to have more children. Also on Wednesday, Vietnam scrapped decades-old laws limiting families to two children in an effort to stem falling birth rates.The Health Ministry's latest data showed that Japan's fertility rate — the average number of babies a woman is expected to have in her lifetime — also fell to a new low of 1.15 in 2024, from 1.2 a year earlier. The number of marriage was slightly up, to 485,063 couples, but the downtrend since the 1970s remains unchanged.Experts say the government's measures have not addressed a growing number of young people reluctant to marry, largely focusing on already married couples.The younger generation are increasingly reluctant to marry or have children due to bleak job prospects, a high cost of living and a gender-biased corporate culture that adds extra burdens for women and working mothers, experts say.A growing number of women also cite pressure to take their husband's surname as a reason for their reluctance to marry. Under Japanese law, couples must choose a single surname to marry. Japan's population of about 124 million people is projected to fall to 87 million by 2070, with 40% of the population over 65.\", 'location': 'JPN', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Japan's births plummet to record low\\nENTITIES: Japan, Shigeru Ishiba, Health Ministry, South Korea, China, Vietnam\\nEVENT: Japan's annual births fell to a record low of 686,061 in 2024, prompting concerns about the country's aging population and future.\\nCONTEXT: Japan's declining birth rate threatens its economy and security.\", 'createdAt': '2025-06-05T08:04:47.658Z'}, {'id': 103388, 'sourceId': 881, 'url': 'https://news.sky.com/story/hamilton-larkhall-and-stonehouse-by-election-polls-open-as-public-cast-votes-to-replace-late-msp-13378939', 'title': 'Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse by-election: Polls open as public cast votes to replace late MSP', 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T06:00:00.000Z', 'content': 'The polls are now open in the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse by-election.It comes following the death of SNP government minister Christina McKelvie.\\nThe MSP died in March at the age of 57, having last year taken medical leave to undergo treatment for secondary breast cancer.Ms McKelvie, the minister for drugs and alcohol policy, had been an MSP since 2007 and represented the Central Scotland region up to 2011 before going on to serve Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse.\\nImage:\\nThe late SNP MSP Christina McKelvie.

It’s a miracle it’s happening at all', 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T04:00:02.000Z', 'content': 'When I first moved to Italy in 2012, I had no idea that more than a decade later I’d still be here. Back then, being British I had the luxury of EU citizenship, and thus of not overthinking things. I was excited by the prospect of spending time in a country that I’d always been fascinated by, and that was that. And yet, post-Brexit, I’m still here. Italy is my home. My community is here and I’ve made my career here. I speak the language fluently, and I’m even making progress with the hand gestures. Politically, I’ve lived through seven prime ministers – from Mario Monti to Giorgia Meloni – but, sadly, one thing I’ve never been able to do, in all these years, is vote in an election.This weekend, Italians will participate in a referendum that includes a proposal to halve the time of legal residency required for non-EU adult foreigners to apply for Italian citizenship, from 10 to five years. (My own path to citizenship is covered by a different, post-Brexit process. However, a yes vote would offer me another route if my various EU-era documents and residency proofs are found wanting by the Italian bureaucracy.)Some of my neighbours face more serious obstacles. I recently attended an Italians Without Citizenship event; this grassroots organisation played a key role in gathering half a million signatures last year, which was required to bypass parliament and put this question directly in the hands of the people. Sonny, a 38-year-old man born in Italy to a Nigerian mother, told the small crowd that he’d been waiting for more than a decade to claim citizenship, because some vital documents were sent to the wrong address. Benedicta, whose parents are from Ghana, explained that she had recently gained citizenship after 17 years of bitter struggle. It’s estimated that as many as 1.4 million people, including 284,000 minors, are living in similar states of limbo, their paths to citizenship blocked due to clerical errors, insufficient income and other systemic obstacles.The fact that this referendum is happening at all is therefore something of a miracle. For the past three decades, the Italian state has been tightening up its citizenship rules so that fewer and fewer are eligible. And the political wind is still blowing very much in that direction. Last year, a broad coalition of parties put forward a proposal to introduce a so-called ius scholae reform, which would have automatically extended citizenship to foreign nationals who have completed a cycle of schooling. Meloni’s government quickly quashed their efforts. And just weeks ago, her administration enacted a law to prevent foreigners from claiming Italian citizenship by descent via their great-grandparents.With the walls closing in, this weekend’s vote is a rare chance for Italians to make the country’s bureaucracy slightly more benevolent. But it has cultural implications, too. Citizens are being asked to go to the polls to make a statement about their own identity and, let’s face it, that identity, like any national identity, is so often tainted by bigotry. Meloni habitually prioritises white, heterosexual, “native” Christian families over other Italians, and millions support her. Yet a similar exclusionary logic persists, in more subtle forms, well beyond the far right. Take the dolce vita reverie of clean-cut youths dressed in designer clothes whizzing around on Vespas and eating pizza and pasta in family-run restaurants. How inclusive, really, is this widely accepted fantasy of a country perpetually frozen in the 1950s, that foreigners and Italians alike consume with such gusto?Don’t get me wrong, I love old movies and nostalgic daydreaming as much as the next Italophile. But the focus on traditional identity all too easily feeds into a desire for ethnic and cultural homogeneity, which neglects so many people’s experiences. Where do Olympic volleyball gold medal winners Paola Egonu and Myriam Sylla fit into this national story, for example? Both are Italians with African ancestry, both are, undeniably, national heroes, yet both struggled to gain citizenship and both have faced discrimination since doing so. Or what about Khaby Lame, the world’s most followed TikToker, who, despite living in Italy since he was one, only gained citizenship in 2022, more than 20 years later? These are just the high-profile cases. By relaxing the rules on naturalisation, Italians would be recognising the dignity and diversity of millions more of their should-be-compatriots, and enriching their own national story with new protagonists in the process. Surely this is an opportunity for everyone involved?Meloni and her colleagues do not see it that way. Earlier this week the prime minister declared that she “will not be collecting” her referendum ballot, and several high-profile ministers, including Matteo Salvini, leader of the League party, have been encouraging people to “head to the beach” instead of participating. The government seems to be hoping that fewer than 50% of Italians will turn up to the polls, that the referendum will not reach quorum and that the organisers will be humiliated for their efforts.As a future citizen, albeit one currently without a voice, I am crossing my fingers that enough of my neighbours will demonstrate the requisite common sense and civic duty to at least show up. Politics aside, this is an opportunity for those privileged with the right to vote to prove that they care as much about the future of Italy as I and so many of my fellow migrant-residents do.\\nJamie Mackay is a writer and translator based in Florence', 'location': 'ITA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Italy citizenship referendum: fairer rules possible\\nENTITIES: Italy, Jamie Mackay, Giorgia Meloni, Matteo Salvini, League party, Paola Egonu, Myriam Sylla, Khaby Lame\\nEVENT: Italians will vote on a referendum to halve the residency requirement for non-EU citizens to apply for citizenship from 10 to 5 years, facing opposition from the current government.\\nCONTEXT: Referendum offers chance to ease citizenship rules, challenge bigotry.', 'createdAt': '2025-06-05T08:04:47.658Z'}, {'id': 106588, 'sourceId': 12357, 'url': 'https://twitchy.com/warren-squire/2025/06/05/galactus-head-popcorn-bucket-reaction-fantastic-four-movie-tie-in-n2413801', 'title': 'New Fantastic Four Movie Has Some Comic Fans More Excited Over a Popcorn Bucket than the Film Itself', 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T04:30:59.000Z', 'content': \"Disney Marvel’s Fantastic Four: First Steps is surfing into theaters in late July, but we’re already getting a sneak peek at some of the movie theater tie-ins.

Elsewhere, the other big reveal was perhaps the new James Bond game from Hitman developer IO Interactive, with a youthful, fresh-faced 007.\\nIt may have lacked a surprise from one of Sony’s big names, but the rest of the presentation was filled with some pretty great announcements.

Two years later, however, and it’s reappeared in pretty promising shape.\\nThe gameplay looks somewhere between Vanquish and Astral Chain, with a promised ‘two-in-one twist of action and strategy’ as a young girl named Dianna sits on your back and throws out assist attacks during battles. It’s set to be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC in 2026.\\nRomeo Is A Dead Man\\nJapanese developer Goichi Suda, aka Suda51, revealed his new ‘ultra-violent science-fiction’ game, Romeo Is A Dead Man. The opening of the trailer sports a cel-shaded comic book style, but the gameplay appears to be more visually grounded, albeit with the bloody spectacle you’d expect from the creator of No More Heroes.\\nYou play as Romeo Stargazer, an FBI investigator who hunts wanted criminals across space. The game is set to launch in 2026 on PlayStation 5.\\nSilent Hill f\\nKonami’s next mainline instalment in the Silent Hill franchise, Silent Hill f, received a creepy new trailer, which showed off some of the spectacularly messed up monster designs.\\nThe trailer also confirmed a September 25, 2025 release date across PlayStation 5, PC, and Xbox Series X/S. It might be just before the Halloween season, but this looks set to haunt you for weeks.\\nFinal Fantasy Tactics – The Ivalice Chronicles\\nThis long-rumoured remaster was finally revealed, with the name of Final Fantasy Tactics – The Ivalice Chronicles.

While you directly control one, the other assists in combat, and you can switch between the two at the press of a button.\\nBloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement is set to launch in 2026 on PlayStation 5.\\nMortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection\\nDigital Eclipse, the studio known for retro gaming compilations like Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration, are back with a new Mortal Kombat retrospective.\\nThe collection boasts over 20 different playable versions of the classic games, across arcade, console, and handheld entries.

The former is similar to the Nioh combat seen in past games, while the Ninja style serves up quick movements, aerial actions, Ninjitsu techniques, and other abilities.\\nOther announcements\\nWhile these were the main highlights, there were several other smaller announcements, with new trailers for Sea Of Thieves-like Sea Remnants, Tides Of Tomorrow from the creators of Road 96, and Sword Of The Sea from the team behind The Pathless.\\nThere were release dates for several indie titles too, with Baby Steps slated for September 8, Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound arriving on July 31, and survival climber Cairn planned for November 5, with a demo available now.\\nAs for Ghost of Yōtei, Sony announced it will offer a gameplay deep dive on the sequel in July, ahead of its launch on October 2, 2025.\\nA gameplay deep dive is happening next month (Sony Interactive Entertainment)\\nEmail\\xa0gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below,\\xa0follow us on Twitter.\\nTo submit Inbox letters and Reader’s Features more easily, without the need to send an email, just use our\\xa0Submit Stuff page here.\\nFor more stories like this,\\xa0check our Gaming page.\\nArrow\\nMORE: Mario Kart World review in progress – not the game you thought it was\\nArrow\\nMORE: Where to buy Nintendo Switch 2 consoles in the UK today\\nArrow\\nMORE: Games Inbox: What are your Nintendo Switch 2 first impressions?\\nGameCentral\\nSign up for exclusive analysis, latest releases, and bonus community content.', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Sony State of Play: New Games Revealed\\nENTITIES: Sony, PlayStation, Capcom, Arc System Works, IO Interactive, Enhance Games, Konami, Digital Eclipse, Vertigo Games, Maze Theory, Eidos-Montreal, Koei Tecmo, Team Ninja\\nEVENT: Sony's State Of Play revealed new games like Lumines Arise, Pragmata, Romeo Is A Dead Man, Silent Hill f, Final Fantasy Tactics – The Ivalice Chronicles, Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement, Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection, Thief VR: Legacy Of Shadow, and Nioh 3, with release dates spanning from 2025 to 2026.\\nCONTEXT: Sony's State Of Play showcased upcoming games for PlayStation and other platforms, focusing on diverse titles rather than first-party exclusives.\", 'createdAt': '2025-06-05T08:04:47.658Z'}, {'id': 105534, 'sourceId': 12618, 'url': 'https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/2064561/morrisons-horror-woman-wheelchair-throws-items-attacks-people-rampage', 'title': \"Morrisons horror as woman in wheelchair 'throws items and attacks people' in rampage\", 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T02:01:00.000Z', 'content': 'A chaotic scene unfolded at a Morrisons in Eccles, Greater Manchester, when a woman in a wheelchair began \"throwing items\" and \"attacking people\" during a self-checkout meltdown.The shocking incident was captured on video, showing the woman hurling products into the air, to the audible shock of onlookers.

It will also put $455m towards improving its compliance, safety and quality programmes.Under the deal, Boeing also agreed to pay a criminal penalty of $487.2m, although half of that was already paid in 2021.\"Boeing is committed to complying with its obligations under this resolution, which include a substantial additional fine and commitments to further institutional improvements and investments,\" said a company spokesperson. If the deal is approved by a federal judge the plane maker will avoid a criminal fraud trial.\"The [DOJ] agreed that it will not further criminally prosecute the company\", said Boeing in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing.The BBC has contacted the DOJ to request further comment on the agreement.Two 737 Max aircraft crashed in separate but almost identical accidents that killed 346 people.In October 2018, all 189 people on a Lion Air flight died after the aircraft crashed into the Java Sea 13 minutes after take-off from Jakarta, Indonesia.In March 2019, an Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed six minutes after take-off from the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa. All 157 people on-board were killed. Both crashes were linked to faulty flight control systems.In 2021, Boeing agreed to settle US fraud charges and admitted deception over hiding information from safety officials about the design of its 737 Max planes.Relatives of the victims will have the chance to appeal this latest deal when it is considered by a federal judge.Mr Singh says the latest agreement has provoked \"visceral outrage\" from his clients and believes the current payout is insufficient.\"If you look at that $1.1bn, it\\'s actually like Boeing paying $10 to escape criminal liability.

2025\\nBy\\nAAP\\nAustralia is considering imposing tariffs on countries that persist with high carbon-emission production, and forming a trading bloc in the region for those nations that are pursuing net zero emission goals.The case for such tariffs has been made by think tank Climate Energy Finance days after federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen signalled openness to imposing charges on emissions-heavy steel and cement.Carbon border adjustment mechanisms, known as CBAMs, are intended to prevent those local industries that are forced to adopt more expensive power sources and production methods from being undercut by foreign companies using cheaper methods.Without them, steelmakers and other producers may choose to move factories offshore to countries with less stringent regulations on pollution, a problem known as 'carbon leakage'.The European Union has been leading the charge and its carbon border adjustment mechanism is scheduled to come into full force in 2026.There was a strong case for an Asian equivalent building on the 17 domestic carbon pricing schemes already across the region, Climate Energy Finance net-zero transformation analyst and report author Matt Pollard said.This includes Australia, which forces big polluters to pay a carbon penalty if their emissions are above a certain threshold. Energy and Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen (pictured) was quizzed by the ABC's David Speers about whether he would bring in a carbon tariff - and twice refused to rule it out This would see levies placed on carbon-intensive products such as steel, cement and lime imported from abroad and could make the building process more expensive China, South Korea, Japan and Singapore also have carbon pricing in some shape or form, but those in developing economies in Asia do not.This form of environmental protectionism would effectively function as a price on carbon in international trade.'As a result, lower-emission products can more effectively compete against higher-emissions products in a global market,' Mr Pollard explained.The think tank wants Australia to spearhead the conversation as part of its bid to co-host the COP31 climate summit alongside Pacific nations.Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen would not rule out the possibility of carbon tariffs on specific sectors, such as steel and cement, during an interview on ABC's Insiders on SundayHe cited an ongoing review into carbon leakage headed by Australian National University climate change economics expert Frank Jotzo.'We want to ensure Australian industry is best placed to compete in a decarbonising world,' he said on Sunday.Opposition energy and emissions reduction spokesman Dan Tehan criticised the minister for floating the idea immediately after winning the federal election.'He's put electricity prices up, he's put gas prices up, and he's put emissions up, and now he wants to follow Donald Trump's lead and put in place tariffs,' Mr Tehan said on social media platform X on Sunday.Mr Pollard rejected the comparison to the US president's 'erratically applied, economically and industrially destructive and investment-deterring' tariff agenda.'Carbon border adjustment mechanisms are not discriminatory, and enhance globalisation, international collaboration and climate action - which is intrinsically a global problem,' he said.While they are tariffs by nature, carbon border adjustment mechanisms have the opposite objectives of the Trump administration's trade policies that are designed to 'enhance protectionism and isolationism'.\", 'location': 'AUS', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Australia considers carbon tariffs, regional trading bloc\\nENTITIES: Anthony Albanese, Donald Trump, Chris Bowen, Climate Energy Finance, Frank Jotzo, Dan Tehan, European Union, China, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Australia, ABC, Australian National University\\nEVENT: Australia is considering imposing tariffs on countries with high carbon emissions and forming a trading bloc for nations pursuing net-zero goals; Energy Minister Chris Bowen signaled openness to charges on emissions-heavy steel and cement.\\nCONTEXT: Australia considers carbon tariffs, mirroring EU's CBAM.\", 'createdAt': '2025-06-05T08:04:47.658Z'}, {'id': 103609, 'sourceId': 2, 'url': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-harvard-visas-rcna211079', 'title': \"Trump moves to deny visas to Harvard's international students\", 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T01:40:11.000Z', 'content': 'President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he will deny visas for foreign students trying to come to the United States to attend Harvard University, his latest attack on the prominent Ivy League college.The administration tried late last month to revoke Harvard’s ability to enroll foreign students — a move that was swiftly blocked by a federal judge.In a proclamation Wednesday, Trump said Harvard failed to present sufficient information about its foreign students to the federal government.“Harvard provided data on misconduct by only three students, and the data it provided was so deficient that the DHS could not evaluate whether it should take further actions,” Trump said, referring to the Department of Homeland Security.Harvard said it would fight to protect its international students. \"This is yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard’s First Amendment rights,\" a spokesperson for the university said Wednesday night. Trump made his pledge as he announced what amounts to a travel ban for 12 countries and limitations on seven others.The proclamation said the president would “restrict the entry of foreign nationals who seek to enter the United States solely or principally to participate in a course of study at Harvard University or in an exchange visitor program hosted by Harvard University.”It added that the State Department would review existing foreign students under F, M or J visas to see whether their visas should be revoked.Trump and his administration have attacked Harvard, saying it has not done enough to combat antisemitism on campus during demonstrations against the Israel-Hamas war.Harvard in April rejected Trump administration demands that included auditing viewpoints of the student body. In response, the federal government said it was freezing more than $2 billion in federal grants.The administration previously sought to limit Harvard\\'s ability to enroll foreign students by revoking its certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, Harvard said.

easing child poverty, but urged the Government to axe the two-child benefit cap as economists warned the scope of the change would be limited.Campaigners and school leaders said the change, which will see all pupils in families that claim universal credit in England made eligible for the scheme, will relieve pressure on household budgets.But organisations including the NSPCC, the National Children’s Bureau and Action for Children insisted the abolition of the two-child welfare rule was still needed.Meanwhile, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warned the expansion would “not see anything like 100,000 children lifted out of poverty next year” and that lifting the cap “would have a lower cost per child lifted out of poverty.”The Government said the change would lift 100,000 children out of poverty (Danny Lawson/PA)PA ArchiveThe cap, which was introduced in 2017, restricts child tax credit and universal credit to two children in most households.Hundreds of thousands more pupils across the country will be able to access means-tested free school meals when the provision is extended from September 2026, the Department for Education (DfE) announced on Thursday.Currently, households in England on\\xa0universal\\xa0credit\\xa0must earn below £7,400 a year (after tax and not including benefits) to qualify for free school meals.But the Government has announced that every pupil whose household is on\\xa0universal\\xa0credit\\xa0will have a new entitlement to free school lunches from the start of the 2026/27 academic year.The move comes after campaigners and education leaders have called for free school meals to be extended to all children whose families are on\\xa0universal\\xa0credit\\xa0to ease pressures on young people living in poverty.Nearly 2.1 million pupils – almost one in four of all pupils (24.6%) – in England were eligible for free school meals in January 2024.The DfE has said more than half a million more children are expected to benefit from a free meal every school day as a result of the expansion, and nearly £500 will be put back into parents’ pockets every year.Sir Keir Starmer has indicated he is considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap but declined to give further details ahead of the autumn (Stefan Rousseau/PA)PA WireIt suggested that the expansion will lift 100,000 children across England completely out of poverty.Chris Sherwood, chief executive of the NSPCC, said the move was a “welcome step in the right direction” and “a lifeline for many families who are struggling to survive in this cost-of-living crisis”.But he added: “By removing the two-child limit, the government could lift over 350,000 children out of poverty, which, if coupled with an ambitious child poverty strategy later in the year, would help tackle the crisis children are facing.”Action for Children chief executive Paul Carberry said the changes would make a “big difference” but “by itself, it can’t deliver the bold, ambitious reduction in child poverty that the Prime Minister has promised”.Sir Keir Starmer has indicated he is considering scrapping the two-child limit amid the prospect of a backbench rebellion over the policy, but has declined to give further details ahead of the publication of the Government’s flagship child poverty strategy in the autumn.Mr Carberry said: “This must set out a comprehensive and funded plan to fix our inadequate social security system, beginning with the abolition of the cruel two-child limit and benefit cap.”Anna Feuchtwang, chief executive of the National Children’s Bureau, said the expansion should be a “down payment” on further investment in addressing child poverty in the autumn.She said it was “crucial” that the Government reconsiders its position on the two-child limit for the autumn.Anna Taylor, executive director of The Food Foundation, called it a “landmark day for children”.She said: “The expansion of free school meals is supported by the overwhelming majority of people in the UK – regardless of how they vote.“We all know that feeding our children well, whatever their background is not rocket science, it is about priorities and today the government put children first.”The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that in the long term, the change would mean free lunches for about 1.7 million additional children, but that in the short run, the announcement would benefit “considerably fewer pupils”.Christine Farquharson, associate director at the think tank, said: “Transitional protections introduced in 2018 have substantially increased the number of children receiving free school meals today – so in the short run, today’s announcement will both cost considerably less (around £250 million a year) and benefit considerably fewer pupils (the government’s estimate is 500,000 children).“This also means that today’s announcement will not see anything like 100,000 children lifted out of poverty next year.”She added: “There is some evidence too that school meals can have benefits for children’s health and attainment.“But if the government’s main interest is to reduce child poverty, there are other measures – such as lifting the two-child limit – that would have a lower cost per child lifted out of poverty.”', 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Free school meals

Dry, sunny weather has helped butterflies get out early, survive for longer than usual and lay plenty of eggs.The naturalist Matthew Oates noted 36 consecutive days when he saw butterflies on the wing, from Good Friday through to late May – a cheering and increasingly unusual experience in this country.Lepidopterists are a bit like farmers, apt to grumble about the weather unless it is a perfect balance of sunshine and some rain. Without rain, caterpillar food plants shrivel up and die, and the next generation do not thrive. So the current rains are very welcome, and should ensure emerging caterpillars have plentiful food.But this bright picture unfurls against much darker big-picture trends. Butterflies are sun-loving animals; global heating should mean British populations are booming, but in fact the opposite has been happening. Last summer was the second-worst year for common butterflies since scientific records began in 1976. For the first time, more than half of Britain’s 59 native species are in long-term decline.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionHopefully this summer sees a big bounceback for British butterflies, but even in good times we must note that these well-studied insects are a bellwether for the global collapse of insect populations.

Eighteen people in total lost their lives.For Patel, now 21, the memories are blurred by trauma and lost to time, much like the friends and teachers he lost that day. But on the 10th anniversary of the tragedy, he felt ready to revisit that chapter of his life.“I had always wanted to know what had happened, because nobody shared it with me,” he said.Joined by his former classmate and fellow survivor, Emyr Uzayr, Patel began the journey to retrace the very trails that once tested their limits — and to heal.The reunionWhen Patel and Uzayr reunited for the climb on May 20 this year, they were ready — despite lingering anxiety and fear — to honor the friends who never came home.The two had stayed in a vague sort of touch after the 2015 disaster, little more than brief hellos on Instagram and scattered “how are you” messages.Despite barely speaking over the years, one thing was clear for both of them: returning to Mount Kinabalu was unfinished business. They were both eager to return and shake off the ghosts on the 10th anniversary of the earthquake.On the climb, they reunited with Cornelius Sanan, the 43-year-old Malaysian mountain guide who, 10 years earlier, had saved Patel’s life.Sanan told CNN that the first thing he said to Patel was, “Where are your magic shoes?”“I wish I still had them,” Patel replied, “but they held too many painful memories, so my parents didn’t want me to keep them.”Though the bright orange shoes were long gone, Patel wore a familiar religious pendant around his neck — his lucky charm, which Sanan recognized. It was the same pendant Patel had worn on the day of the quake.The group hoped to complete the climb in two days. But in the early hours of May 21, heavy rain began to fall, forcing them to spend an extra day on the mountain.What could have been a frustrating delay turned into an opportunity to listen to the stories of the locals who still remembered that tragic day, and to hear from Sanan himself.“It became more of a shared journey than a personal one,” Uzayr reflected.The next morning, at 3:30 a.m., just as the rain eased, they resumed their climb through the steep, soggy terrain of Mount Kinabalu.“It was physically very tough,” Uzayr admitted. “At some point, I wondered — how did we even manage this when we were just kids?”Under clear skies and with fresh mountain air all around, as Uzayr climbed, the old memories surged back.“Every step we took,” the 21-year-old recalled, “memories of our friends came flooding back.”The recollectionUnlike Patel, Uzayr remembers everything from that fateful day which began with laughter, the thrill of a long-awaited school trip finally coming to life.“We were just kids, telling each other, ‘Hurry up! Move faster!’” he recalled with a soft smile.The day had only just begun when the ground began to tremble.“The whole mountain shook,” he said. “And then, thousands of rocks — some the size of car tires — came crashing down from above at very fast, fast speed.”Teachers shouted, “Get down! Get down!”But the rocks fell faster than anyone could react to.“I remember the colors of my friends’ jackets everywhere,” he said quietly, “and then… the bodies.”Uzayr was left covered in cuts, with a fractured skull. But he made it out alive.For Patel, though; the memories are mostly lost and scattered. It is Sanan, the mountain guide who found him, who now helps fill in the blanks.He shows Patel the exact tree where he had been found, dangling for hours — barely visible.“We saw a bit of movement and thought, ‘maybe someone is still alive’,” Sanan told CNN. “We made the decision to bring Patel up without any proper gear. We just had to try.”“If I had landed just a few meters to the left or right,” Patel said, “they wouldn’t have been able to see me. The trees would’ve hidden me completely.”He was severely injured, physically and emotionally.“I completely couldn’t speak, couldn’t walk, couldn’t write,” he recalled, “so I had to relearn how to do every basic thing from the start.”And yet, the man who pulled Patel from the trees wasn’t trained in rescue at all. Sanan had only been a mountain guide for five years, with no prior experience in a natural disaster. But on that day, instinct took over.Sanan lost someone too — his cousin Robbie Sapinggi, a fellow guide who had been leading a Thai tourist when the earthquake hit. Sapinggi was caught under falling rocks. Knowing he wouldn’t make it, he told the tourist to go on without him. Another mountain guide, Joseph Soludin, also lost his life that day.Sanan still guides today. It’s his way of honoring Sapinggi’s memory.“I continue guiding,” he said, “because part of my soul lives here (in Mount Kinabalu).”To Uzayr and Patel, Sanan will always be their hero — the man who saved lives.But Sanan shakes his head.“We were all there that day — guides, rescuers, everyone. No one did it alone,” he said softly. “We were all heroes, in our own way.”The trails on Mount Kinabalu have since been rebuilt. A dedicated rescue team now stands ready every day.Safety has changed, but the mountain hasn’t. High up in those peaks, the memories of 2015 still live on.“In everything we do now, we carry their memories,” Uzayr said. “We honored what our friends never got the chance to finish.”And sometimes, when the weight of memory grows heavy, they think of the little things.Like the bright orange shoes caught in a tree — proof that life clings on, even in the darkest moments.“We found a renewed sense of purpose,” Uzayr said. “And realized it was time to accept the past and move on to the future.”The-CNN-Wire™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Her battle with EB lasted for three months.”\\u200cWhen the couple got pregnant for a third time they again travelled to London for testing.Thankfully, doctors were able to confirm that their third daughter, Ava, did not have EB.Ava grew up with her family campaigning to raise funds for DEBRA to help stop other families facing the ordeals they had – but insists more needs to be done to educate.\\u200cShe said: “I have many early memories of my parents fundraising for DEBRA at our village gala days.

However, on Thursday he told the Guardian that the country’s citizenship office had subsequently reviewed Tate’s documents and found no fault with them.“They’ve found the files and according to the records, at the time when Mr Tate was granted the citizenship, he was cleared by Interpol, and the UK, so that was the decision at the time,” he said.The review, he said, meant the government was not currently taking any further steps to revoke Tate’s citizenship.“The chairman [of the citizenship office] confirms that the way it is at the moment he [Tate] remains a citizen and for Vanuatu there are no further actions to be taken,” he said.Manassah said that Tate would never have been granted citizenship if the government had been aware of the allegations he faced at the time.“If the government had been aware of this at the start, and our processes were working, we should have not allowed him in the first place,” he said, adding that: “We can’t just go back and revoke based on information that is discovered later.”Tate, a 38-year-old misogynist influencer reportedly secured a “golden passport” through a citizenship-by-investment programme that allows foreign nationals to buy citizenship for $130,000 (£96,000), according to the OCCRP and Intelligence Online.In 2021 the Guardian detailed in a months-long investigation how Vanuatu sold passports – and with them visa-free access to the UK and EU – to thousands of individuals. Buyers included people linked to sanctions, or facing serious allegations, or with warrants out for their arrest.Acknowledging that Vanuatu’s citizenship program has a “very bad reputation overseas” Manassah said the government would strengthen its “due diligence processes so that such instances do not happen again”.Tate, a former professional kickboxer who has amassed more than 10 million followers on X, runs an online academy where he says he teaches young men how to get rich and attract women.He was granted citizenship to Vanuatu in December 2022, the OCCRP reported, the same month that he and his brother Tristan, 36, were arrested by Romanian authorities on charges of human trafficking and forming an organised crime group. Andrew Tate was also accused of rape.The Tate brothers, who grew up in Luton in the UK, have been under criminal investigation in Romania since April 2022.Tate’s spokesperson declined to comment to the Guardian earlier this week on the reports of his Vanuatu citizenship.According to Manassah, Tate’s citizenship could be revoked if he was found guilty.“If he has been convicted then definitely measures to revoke his citizenship, that can be determined later. That would be something the government could consider in future,” he said.For now he said: “New regulations have been signed off by the prime minister and the current chairman under [citizenship commissioner] Charles Maniel, is trying to ensure that similar incidents do not happen again and that we our improve our due diligence processes.”The Tate brothers deny the allegations they face in Romania, and an appeals court said in December that a human trafficking case could not proceed because of legal and procedural irregularities. The case has been sent back to prosecutors.The pair are due to be extradited to the UK after the conclusion of proceedings in Romania. UK prosecutors confirmed last week they had authorised 10 charges against Andrew Tate, including rape, actual bodily harm, human trafficking and controlling prostitution for gain, and 11 charges against Tristan Tate, including rape, actual bodily harm and human trafficking.

The school's aim is to teach children faster, with personalised programmes that adapt to each learner's pace.What is Schooling Like?At Alpha, the morning starts with lively activities. In a colourful kindergarten classroom, six-year-old Sarah Schipper collaborates with classmates on a logic game. They hop on coloured dots, trying to solve a puzzle while cheering each other on.The environment is upbeat, with pop music and encouragement replacing the traditional teacher-led lecture. Students are encouraged to think independently and support each other, fostering not just knowledge but confidence.How Does the AI-Driven System Work?After the initial group activity, students move onto individualised lessons on laptops. These 30-minute sessions cover maths, English, science, and social studies. The programme uses specialised apps to help children master topics at a pace that suits them—up to five times faster than traditional methods, according to school officials. The goal is to create confident learners who can progress without the constant oversight of an adult.Sarah says she loves working on her computer and wants to be a scientist when she grows up. She believes Alpha's approach will help her reach her ambitions. Her enthusiasm isn't unusual; many students at the school report high levels of engagement and curiosity.The guides, who act as facilitators rather than traditional teachers, provide resources and support but don't give direct answers. This encourages children to develop independence and problem-solving skills.Concerns Over Screen Time and Education QualitySarah explains she is motivated to work on her computer even after school. She claims she sometimes works until midnight to complete her mastery goals. Her story highlights a broader debate about screen time; many parents worry about children spending too long on devices, especially when they're used for educational purposes.Swain, the campus lead, says most children finish their lessons during school hours, so homework isn't usually necessary. Younger students, in particular, aren't allowed to take laptops home. This approach aims to balance technological benefits with concerns about overexposure, especially given that US students spend an average of 98 minutes daily on school devices.Does Personalised Learning Really Work?Early data suggests that Alpha's model is effective. Co-founder MacKenzie Price claims their students outperform most benchmarks nationally, learning core subjects faster and with better retention. These results are encouraging for advocates of personalised learning, although critics warn that AI cannot replace the social and emotional aspects of teaching.The school's success stems partly from its realisation that traditional classrooms often fail to meet individual needs. Price, who launched Alpha a decade ago after her own frustrations with standard schooling, believes technology can make education more engaging and efficient. She points out that children learn best when they love what they're doing, and Alpha aims to foster that love through customised, mastery-based lessons.The Role of Teachers in a Tech-Driven FutureWhile AI handles core instruction, guides at Alpha are focused on motivation and emotional support. They don't create lesson plans or grade assignments, freeing up more time to build relationships with students. This reimagined role is a significant shift from traditional teaching, raising questions about the future of educators.Experts like Robin Lake from the Centre on Reinventing Public Education argue public schools could learn from Alpha's approach. They suggest that many teaching tasks could be streamlined with technology, allowing teachers to focus on mentoring and critical thinking. However, they emphasise that AI should complement, not replace, the human element crucial to effective learning.\", 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Texas School Replaces Teachers with AI System\\nENTITIES: Alpha School, Texas, MacKenzie Price\\nEVENT: A school in Texas has swapped the traditional classroom for a system entirely powered by artificial intelligence, with core lessons delivered by AI and guides focused on motivation and emotional support.\\nCONTEXT: The school's success stems partly from its realization that traditional classrooms often fail to meet individual needs.\", 'createdAt': '2025-06-05T08:04:47.658Z'}, {'id': 107601, 'sourceId': 12486, 'url': 'https://www.cnet.com/videos/we-finally-unbox-and-play-the-switch-2-should-you-buy-one/#ftag=CADf328eec', 'title': 'We Finally Unbox And Play The Switch 2.

Fans are dead, no gas... lunch service is a bust, basically,” as hordes of fans wait at the bar.His team battled last-minute problems due to the hastily pulled together launch event PrimeClarkson sells his own Hawkstone lager in the venue and wanted to have all of the produce sold there grown or reared by British farmers.In a post to the pub\\'s website, he said that ingredients like quinine in tonic water cannot be grown in Britain but emphasised that they are \"doing all we possibly can to support British farming\".“There are so many things that you discover about opening and running a pub that you wouldn’t even consider,” he told PA. “When you and I go in a pub, you ask for a pint, you get a pint, you sit down, maybe have some pork scratchings or something, and it doesn’t look that difficult.“But there’s an enormous amount of regulation on food hygiene and safety. And then you’ve got staffing. You’ve got to try and find chefs, you’ve got to find waitresses, and that’s all very complicated,” he added to PA.His timing might have also added unnecessary extra pressure.He opened The Farmer’s Dog last August (PA)PA WireHe explained: “I wanted to try and capture the August Bank Holiday Weekend, which meant that we were trying to open it at the exact same time as I was doing the harvest,” he said. “So I’d spend all day trying desperately to get the pub open and dealing with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of problems.“Then you get home absolutely knackered, and you have to get into your tractor and do grain carting through the night.

It was during the questioning of Bob Lambert, an officer who deceived at least four women into sexual relationships in the 1980s, and fathered a child with one of them.“Lambert’s lack of attention to detail was shocking; the whole thing seemed like a process to him. Whereas Belinda Harvey, one of the women, meticulously remembered every single detail of their relationship, every feeling, every thought. She said she was in her early 20s when she met him, and she was basically groomed into activism by him. This is someone whose life was completely turned inside out and upside down by the state. This is someone who was raped by the state.”White, the artistic director of Cardiff and Bradford-based theatre company Common/Wealth, is directing a new play based on the scandal and inquiry.Entitled Demand the Impossible, the play – written by Taylor Edmonds and initially commissioned by National Theatre Wales – interrogates police injustice and the infiltration of more than 1,000 political groups between 1968 and 2010.The play has been developed in close collaboration with campaign groups including Undercover Research Network and Police Spies Out of Lives, drawing on the victims’ enormous sense of betrayal and their ongoing fight for justice.“My own friends who were part of the Cardiff Anarchist Network [CAN] were spied on by the police,” White said. “My friend Tom Fowler found out his best friend of four years was an undercover copper called Mark “Marco” Jacobs.”According to CAN, Jacobs took minutes at meetings and made newsletters and banners, but in reality he was gathering intelligence, disrupting the group’s activities, and using it to infiltrate other groups, including a European network of activists.“Tom was frustrated because a lot of people were taking on the spycops story and sensationalising it without talking to the activists involved.

Some of the changes that historically activists have campaigned for, and which are now enshrined in law, like the right of women to have bank accounts, or animal rights, were slowed down because of the effects of infiltration.

Not only can the signature turn words into laws of the land, but it also appoints individuals to some of the highest positions in government, creates or eliminates national policies and allows prisoners to go free.\"In recent months, it has become increasingly apparent that former President Biden\\'s aides abused the power of Presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden\\'s cognitive decline and assert Article II authority,\" Trump wrote. \"This conspiracy marks one of the most dangerous and concerning scandals in American history. The American public was purposefully shielded from discovering who wielded the executive power, all while Biden\\'s signature was deployed across thousands of documents to effect radical policy shifts.\"He continued, saying Biden had suffered from \"serious cognitive decline\" for years, and the Department of Justice (DOJ) recently concluded that Biden should not stand trial, despite clear evidence he broke the law, because of his mental state.EXCLUSIVE: COMER HAILS DOJ\\'S BIDEN PROBE AS HOUSE INVESTIGATION HEATS UP President Trump called on Attorney General Pam Bondi to launch an investigation into whether former President Biden\\'s team used an autopen and covered up the former president\\'s cognitive decline. (Trump: Reuters / Autopen: AP)\"Biden\\'s cognitive issues and apparent mental decline during his presidency were even ‘worse’ in private, and those closest to him ‘tried to hide it’ from the public,\" Trump said. \"To do so, Biden\\'s advisors during his years in office severely restricted his news conferences and media appearances, and they scripted his conversations with lawmakers, government officials, and donors, all to cover up his inability to discharge his duties.\"Still, during the Biden presidency, the White House issued over 1,200 Presidential documents, appointed 235 judges to the federal bench and issued more pardons and commutations than any administration in U.S. history, Trump said.The president wrote about Biden’s decision just two days before Christmas 2024, to commute the sentences of 37 of the 40 most dangerous criminals on federal death row, including mass murderers and child killers.TRUMP SAYS BIDEN DIDN\\'T FAVOR HIS ADMIN\\'S LAX BORDER SECURITY POLICY, SUGGESTS AUTOPEN PLAYED A ROLE A new book describes President Joe Biden\\'s cabinet meetings as \"scripted\" and \"uncomfortable.\"\\xa0 (Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Care Can\\'t Wait Action)\"Although the authority to take these executive actions, along with many others, is constitutionally committed to the President, there are serious doubts as to the decision-making process and even the degree of Biden\\'s awareness of these actions being taken in his name,\" Trump wrote. \"The vast majority of Biden\\'s executive actions were signed using a mechanical signature pen, often called an autopen, as opposed to Biden\\'s own hand. This was especially true of actions taken during the second half of his Presidency, when his cognitive decline had apparently become even more clear to those working most closely with him.\"Given clear indications that President Biden lacked the capacity to exercise his Presidential authority, if his advisors secretly used the mechanical signature pen to conceal this incapacity, while taking radical executive actions all in his name, that would constitute an unconstitutional wielding of the power of the Presidency, a circumstance that would have implications for the legality and validity of numerous executive actions undertaken in Biden\\'s name,\" he added.TRUMP HAS NOT DIRECTED ADMIN TO DECLASSIFY BIDEN DOCS ON HEALTH \\'COVER-UP\\' President-elect Donald Trump shakes hands with U.S. President Joe Biden at Trump\\'s inauguration in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda on January 20, 2025 in Washington, DC (Kenny Holston-Pool/Getty Images)The memo goes on to call for an investigation that addresses if certain individuals, who are not named in the document, conspired to deceive the American public about the former president’s mental state and \"unconstitutionally\" exercised the president’s authority and responsibilities.Specifically, Trump called on the attorney general’s investigation to look at any activity that purposefully shielded the public from information about Biden’s mental and physical health; any agreements between his aides to falsely deem recorded videos of Biden’s cognitive ability as fake; and any agreements between Biden’s aides to require false, public statements that elevated the president’s capabilities.The investigation will also look at which policy documents the autopen was used for, including clemency grants, executive orders, and presidential memoranda, as well as who directed Biden’s signature to be affixed to those documents.Trump said last week that he thinks Biden did not really agree with many of his administration’s lax border security policies, instead suggesting that those surrounding the former president took advantage of his declining faculties and utilized the autopen to pass radical directives pertaining to the border.House Republicans, led by Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, launched an investigation earlier last month aimed at determining whether Biden, who was in declining health during the final months of his presidency, was mentally fit to authorize the use of the autopen. Comer said last week he was \"open\" to dragging Biden before the House to answer questions about the matter if necessary.\\xa0CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPBiden released a statement later Wednesday, deriding Trump\\'s investigation as a \"distraction.\"\\xa0\"Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency.

Any suggestion that I didn’t is ridiculous and false,\" Biden said. \"This is nothing more than a distraction by Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans who are working to push disastrous legislation that would cut essential programs like Medicaid and raise costs on American families, all to pay for tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy and big corporations.\"\\xa0Fox News Digital’s Alec Schemmel and Bradford Betz contributed to this report.', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Trump orders probe into Biden's autopen use\\nENTITIES: Donald Trump, Joe Biden, Pam Bondi, James Comer, Department of Justice, House Oversight Committee\\nEVENT: Trump orders investigation into Biden's autopen use, alleging cover-up of cognitive decline and unconstitutional wielding of presidential power.\\nCONTEXT: Trump suggests Biden's advisors used autopen due cognitive decline.\", 'createdAt': '2025-06-05T08:04:47.658Z'}, {'id': 103824, 'sourceId': 12304, 'url': 'https://www.npr.org/2025/06/05/nx-s1-5424238/new-zealand-parliament-suspends-lawmakers-maori-haka-protest', 'title': 'New Zealand Parliament suspends 3 lawmakers who performed Māori haka in protest', 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T07:36:42.000Z', 'content': \"New Zealand lawmakers Hana-Rāwhiti Maipi-Clarke, top left, Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, bottom left, and Rawiri Waititi, bottom right, watch as other legislators debate their proposed bans in parliament in Wellington on Thursday, June 5, 2025.\\nCharlotte Graham-McLay/AP\\nhide caption\\ntoggle caption\\nCharlotte Graham-McLay/AP\\nWELLINGTON, New Zealand — New Zealand legislators voted Thursday to enact record suspensions from Parliament for three lawmakers who performed a Māori haka to protest a proposed law. Hana-Rāwhiti Maipi-Clarke received a seven-day ban and the leaders of her political party, Debbie Ngarewa-Packer and Rawiri Waititi, were barred for 21 days. Three days had been the longest ban for a lawmaker from New Zealand's Parliament before. The lawmakers from Te Pāti Māori, the Māori Party, performed the haka, a chanting dance of challenge, last November to oppose a widely unpopular bill, now defeated, that they said would reverse Indigenous rights.\\nBut the protest drew global headlines and provoked months of fraught debate among lawmakers about what the consequences for the lawmakers' actions should be and whether New Zealand's Parliament welcomed or valued Māori culture — or felt threatened by it.\\nA committee of the lawmakers' peers in April recommended the lengthy punishments in a report that said the lawmakers were not being punished for the haka itself, but for striding across the floor of the debating chamber towards their opponents while they did it. Maipi-Clarke Thursday rejected that, citing other instances where legislators have left their seats and approached their opponents without sanction. It was expected that the suspensions would be approved, because government parties have more seats in Parliament than the opposition and had the necessary votes to affirm them. But the punishment was so severe that Parliament Speaker Gerry Brownlee in April ordered a free-ranging debate among lawmakers and urged them to attempt to reach a consensus on what repercussions were appropriate. No such accord was reached Thursday. During hours of at times emotional speeches, government lawmakers rejected opposition proposals for lighter sanctions. There were suggestions that opposition lawmakers might extend the debate for days or even longer through filibuster-style speeches, but with the outcome already certain and no one's mind changed, all lawmakers agreed that the debate should end.\", 'location': 'NZL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: NZ Parliament suspends lawmakers for Māori haka\\nENTITIES: Hana-Rāwhiti Maipi-Clarke, Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, Rawiri Waititi, Te Pāti Māori, Gerry Brownlee, New Zealand Parliament\\nEVENT: New Zealand Parliament suspended three lawmakers for performing a Māori haka in protest of a bill.\\nCONTEXT: The suspensions sparked debate about Māori culture in Parliament.', 'createdAt': '2025-06-05T08:04:47.658Z'}, {'id': 105130, 'sourceId': 12850, 'url': 'https://naturaldisasters.einnews.com/article/819241369/P01RyU2vkz9wehnm?ref=rss&ecode=5DCHg6ojdayQpKlr', 'title': 'World Environment Day: NE floods another reminder of climate change', 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T06:38:47.000Z', 'content': 'New Delhi, June 5- Northeast India has been reeling under the monsoon fury with states of the region struggling with severe floods and landslides triggered by continuous heavy rainfall.\\nAmong the NE states, Assam is the worst-affected.\\nNortheast flood fury is another grim reminder of how global warming climate change and human hand are affecting mother nature.\\nFlash floods and landslides that followed torrential monsoon rains destroyed livelihoods and claimed many lives.\\nAccording to the IMD, rains are expected to continue in Assam.

While there has been no use of this type of weapon of mass destruction against another country since the war, two nuclear rivals in South Asia—India and Pakistan—exchanged large-scale fire last month, while other nuclear-armed countries continue to modernize their arsenals.\\nThis photo shows the radioactive plume from the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki in Japan on August 9, 1945.\\nHiromichi Matsuda/Handout from Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum/Getty Images\\nIn addition to the aforementioned five countries, France, the United Kingdom, Israel—which are U.S. allies—and North Korea are confirmed or believed to possess nuclear weapons.What To KnowThe Research Center for Nuclear Weapons Abolition announced its estimate on Wednesday, saying the number of deployable nuclear warheads—those ready for immediate use or stored for potential deployment—had increased by 32 from last year, reaching 9,615.With regard to the three largest deployable nuclear arsenals, Russia had 4,310 warheads, a decrease of 0.8 percent from 2018, while the U.S. possessed 3,700, a decrease of 2.6 percent. In contrast, China\\'s arsenal increased by 150 percent, reaching 600 warheads.\\nAmong all the nuclear powers, China has seen the most significant increase in its number of warheads, adding 360 to its arsenal. Chinese President Xi Jinping ordered the country to accelerate the buildup of nuclear forces, even as Beijing called on Russia and the U.S. to pursue nuclear disarmament.Meanwhile, North Korea—which tested nuclear weapons between 2006 and 2017—has seen the highest percentage increase in its number of warheads, rising by 233 percent. However, with 50 warheads, the Northeast Asian nation possesses the world\\'s smallest nuclear arsenal.According to the Japanese think tank, the number of deployable nuclear warheads worldwide has been trending upward since 2018. The most recent estimate, as of this month, shows an increase of 364 nuclear warheads—designed for operational use—in just under a decade.By including non-deployable nuclear warheads—those retired or awaiting dismantlement—the total number of nuclear warheads across all nuclear-armed countries reached 12,340.\\nAn unarmed but nuclear-capable United States Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile launching during an operational test at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California on May 21.\\nSenior Airman Kadielle Shaw/U.S. Space Force\\nWhat People Are SayingThe Research Center for Nuclear Weapons Abolition said in a news release on Wednesday: \"The United States and Russia account for more than 80 percent of the total number of active nuclear warheads and needless to say bear a special responsibility for nuclear disarmament, but the remaining seven countries\\' share also increased from 12 percent in 2018 to 17 percent in 2025.\"U.S. Air Force General Anthony J. Cotton, the commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, testified at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on March 26: \"To effectively deter adversaries across the spectrum of threats requires sustained legacy triad systems and urgently completing the multigenerational, decades-long modernization of all three legs of the nuclear deterrent and its critical [nuclear command, control and communications] systems.\"Senior Colonel Wu Qian, a spokesperson for the Chinese Defense Ministry, said on February 27: \"On defense budget, the U.S. military spending has topped the world for many years in a row and is higher than that of the following eight countries combined, which deeply concerns the international community. I believe that the U.S. should put \\'America First\\' into practice in this regard, and be the first to cut its nuclear arsenal and military expenditure.\"What Happens NextAll nuclear-armed nations are expected to continue modernizing their arsenals amid conflicts around the world, such as the war in Ukraine, tensions on the Korean Peninsula and in the Taiwan Strait, and the great power competition among the U.S., Russia and China.', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Nuclear Warheads Increase; Arms Race Warning\\nENTITIES: Russia, United States, China, North Korea, India, Pakistan\\nEVENT: The number of deployable nuclear warheads has increased, with China and North Korea showing the largest percentage increases in their arsenals.\\nCONTEXT: Nuclear warhead numbers are increasing amid global tensions.', 'createdAt': '2025-06-05T08:04:47.658Z'}, {'id': 104599, 'sourceId': 904, 'url': 'https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/facebook-lincolnshire-cornwall-age-uk-bude-b1231342.html', 'title': 'Siblings reunited with school photo found in charity shop 300 miles away', 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T06:00:18.000Z', 'content': 'A brother and sister who were reunited with their primary school photo after it ended up in a charity shop more than 300 miles away said their story shows “the power of social media”.Chris Kirkum, 32, who lives in Holsworthy, Devon, and his sister Jade Kirkum, 30, who lives in Bude, Cornwall, were roughly eight and six when they posed for a school photo at what was then Bude Junior School in Cornwall.Over the years, the photo, which was placed inside a brown, metallic frame, mysteriously ended up in an Age UK shop in Boston, Lincolnshire, seemingly lost to time.The photo of Jade and Chris Kirkum when they were in primary school (Michael Beecroft/PA)However, thanks to a post from Michael Beecroft, 42, from Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, who came across the photo during a visit to the charity shop and posted about it in a Facebook group called “Charity Shop S**t” on March 9, the siblings were reunited with the nostalgic picture within a few days.“I randomly joined the group as it appeared on my news feed and I thought it was quite funny,” Ms Kirkum, who is a full-time mother, told the PA news agency.“One day, someone who went to school with Chris and I but was not in the same classes as us tagged me, and I clicked on the link and it took me to the picture of Chris and I, which was the most bizarre thing.”Mr Kirkum, who works as a mechanic, told PA: “I was quite taken aback.“I think I was just doing the washing up and Jade asked me if I had seen the Facebook post and I said no and when I saw it, I couldn’t believe it was a photo of us two sitting together in primary school.”Jade Kirkum reunited with the school photo (Family handout/PA)Mr Kirkum said he could vividly remember the day the photo was taken.“At the time, I remember thinking to myself: ‘Oh, she’s got to sit on my lap’ and I was grumpy about it,” he said.Chloe Poole – an administration assistant based in Boston – managed to retrieve the photo from the charity shop and posted it to Ms Kirkum on March 10, who received it on March 13.Ms Poole, 26, said she saw the Facebook post while on a break at work, so decided to retrieve the picture since it was close-by – she was even given it for free by the manager.“Honestly, I’m just glad she could get the photo back.

This cable also provides Chile with a longer route to other continents.Officials from both Google and the Chilean government hailed the project as critical infrastructure with potential to attract millions of dollars in investment from major tech companies, mining and banking firms in Chile and Australia.“The idea of \\u200b\\u200bbuilding this cable is that it can also be used not only by Google but also by other users, such as technology companies operating in Chile,” said Cristian Ramos, director of telecommunications infrastructure for Latin America at Alphabet, Google’s parent company.Although Google did not disclose its total investment, Patricio Rey, general manager of local partner Desarrollo País, a state-owned infrastructure company, estimated the cable project’s value at $300 million to $550 million, with Chile contributing $25 million.The Humboldt Cable will establish Chile as a data gateway for the Asia-Pacific, while strengthening its relations with Asian nations, especially China, its largest trading partner. It also comes as demand for undersea cables surges due to increased reliance on cloud computing services.The next stages involve installing the submarine cable, selecting and contracting a telecommunications operator, and constructing landing stations in Chile.The initiative could heighten tensions as Chile finds itself caught in the middle of an intensifying rivalry between China and the Trump administration.

He’s also warned that premiums for business will need to rise by 36% in the next three years.“No employers should have to worry about the sustainability of the scheme,” he said. “If we delay further the task gets harder.”The government’s bill would lift the threshold for whole of person impairment from 20% to 30%, limiting their compensation to payments to 2.5 years.It has been heavily criticised by the union movement and medical and legal experts who say that the threshold is too high, and will leave workers who are unable to function without the financial support they need.The opposition wants the threshold left as it is, but offered amendments to definitions of bullying and other aspects of the bill, which it said would deliver more modest savings.Greens MLC Abigail Boyd, who is chair of the public accounts committee, said the government had committed “a complete breach of trust” by blurring the impact on various government accounts and failing to produce the modelling that would allow members to assess the impact of the scheme.“I don’t like being misled,” Boyd said. “The treasurer has deliberately confused the nominal fund and the Treasury-managed fund,” she said.

But while these capabilities certainly aren’t out of reach, AI is not the “plug-and-play” solution that some might hope. Without the right data, context, and oversight, the lens offered by AI is blurry at best.According to a 2024 report by IBM, roughly two-thirds of organizations say they’re now deploying AI tools and automation across their SOC environments. However, a 2025 survey by Darktrace reveals that less than half (42%) of CISOs have confidence in their AI deployment and fully understand how AI fits into their security stack. This gap between AI deployment and understanding how to extract value from it isn’t sustainable long-term.CTO of Wazuh.Sprawling webs of interconnectivityNetworks used to be small, contained and relatively easy to protect – often confined to an office or single cloud computing environment. Today, they’re sprawling webs of interconnectivity spanning multiple clouds and endpoint devices. In other words, cybersecurity has gotten more complex.There’s a growing assumption that AI can shed light on this complexity – that if you throw enough data at a model, it will separate the signal from the noise, even without deep integration into your environment. But threats don’t exist in a vacuum. They move through systems, exploit blind spots, and adapt to patterns. And unless an AI system understands the operational baseline – what’s normal, what’s sanctioned, what’s truly anomalous – it’s probably just best-guessing. Sometimes it guesses right, but when it doesn’t, the consequences can be costly.None of this is to say that AI isn’t a force for good. It’s an incredibly powerful tool when wielded in the right way, but businesses need to pace themselves and create the right environment before it can truly deliver on its promises.Are Businesses Prepared for AI?The excitement around AI isn’t new or exclusive to cybersecurity. According to Gartner’s most recent Hype Cycle, both generative AI and cloud-based AI services are currently in the “peak of inflated expectations” phase. What comes next, with any new technology, is the “trough of disillusionment” – this is where the hype meets reality and industries realize that some lessons need to be learned before the technology can ascend to the last part of the cycle, “the plateau of productivity”.This is the very pattern that security teams now find themselves in with AI. Early deployments have revealed just how brittle AI can be when removed from the controlled conditions of lab testing. Sophisticated models that looked flawless in demos can falter in the complex, unpredictable context of a live enterprise environment.False positives are one problem. Analysts know the fatigue of chasing alerts that lead nowhere – and AI, when misapplied, can actually amplify that noise rather than reduce it. But the bigger risk is what AI misses. Algorithms trained on generalized threat data might completely overlook subtle, organization-specific anomalies, such as a lateral movement that piggybacks on a rarely used internal tool, or data exfiltration masked by a legitimate third-party integration. These are the types of threats that slip through when detection efforts lack specific environmental context.Another cause for hesitation is that many AI-powered solutions operate as black boxes, which goes against the grain of the open source, community-driven threat response the industry is now rightly moving toward. Their logic isn’t exposed, their training data isn’t transparent, and their outputs are often unverifiable. For CISOs, that’s a risky proposition.It’s hard enough to explain cybersecurity risks to the board; try explaining why an opaque model flagged – or failed to flag – a critical incident. AI effectiveness is one thing, but trust in AI and its processes is something that must be planned for and cultivated over time.Putting Things into ContextIn cybersecurity, context is everything. AI might detect an anomaly, but can it tell whether that anomaly is benign, malicious, or even expected? That requires more than pattern recognition. It requires a deep understanding of system baselines, user behavior, network topology, and operational rhythms.Without this foundation, AI tools are inevitably prone to misinterpretation: flagging routine administrative scripts as threats, or worse, overlooking subtle indicators of compromise that don’t conform to known attack patterns. That creates more trivial work for security teams as it’s down to them to figure out what’s real and what’s not.This is where network visibility comes into play. AI needs telemetry from every layer of the environment: endpoints, servers, cloud workloads, authentication flows, network traffic, and more. And it needs that data to be correlated, not siloed. An alert from an endpoint only makes sense when viewed alongside what’s happening across the system.A login from an unusual location might be suspicious, unless it’s coming from a known travel route for a senior executive or a new remote hire based in another time zone. AI can’t make those judgments on its own. Without unified context, even the most advanced algorithms are guessing. And in cybersecurity, guessing is always a liability.The Case for UnificationIf AI is going to play a meaningful role in cybersecurity, it first needs a foundation it can trust, and so do the people relying on it. That begins with visibility, but it extends to architecture. Fragmented tools with partial views and proprietary, closed-source alert logic only hinder cybersecurity efforts.What CISOs need is a cohesive layer of detection and response where telemetry is unified, logic is transparent, and automation is tightly aligned with operational context. This is where architectural convergence – for example, the merging of SIEM-level visibility with the orchestration capabilities of extended detection and response (XDR) – becomes critical. This baseline will turn AI into a force multiplier for security teams when correctly deployed.Equally important is explainability. If an AI system flags a potential threat, security teams need to understand why. Not only to validate the alert, but to learn from it, adapt processes, and communicate risk to leaders and stakeholders. Black-box models might seem impressive, but in security, opacity is a threat vector in itself.CISOs don’t need magic; they need clarity. And the best AI implementations are those that put humans in the loop – enhancing decision-making, accelerating triage, and surfacing the insights that matter most without drowning teams in noise.We've compiled a list of the best identity management software.This article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

It’s a torch song that might be on Downing Street playlists as the Government heads into what insiders call “everything month” — the period intended to be the zenith of the political year, launched this week with a major defence review, then hurtling to the big sorting hat of the spending review next Wednesday — and nervous hopes that the promise of a trade agreement with the US will turn from promise to reality, despite another round of delay in finalising implementation from an unreliable White House. Spending tussles already unleashed a bloodbath between a “quad” of influential Cabinet figures and a chancellor tied into an over-tight fiscal corset, with a flurry of costs coming down the line and tensions with her No\\u200910 neighbour and boss. The Starmer-Reeves duo faced a tsunami of rebellions over benefit cuts, anxiety over the lack of a clear upward growth trend and a run of odd “moments” which have either dissolved into messy communications — or led to questions about Labour’s grip on the machinery of power.Overall, the Government feels tetchy and listless: Keir Starmer himself sounded uncertain as to whether he sees a long-term residency behind the glossy black door, answering tautly to a questioner who asked him about his plans that “you’re getting way ahead of me”. It feels, as one senior backbencher who was called in for a pep talk put it, “like one of those schools put in special measures where the head teacher is as stressed as the staff and the playground is always on the brink of chaos”. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he would not resile from his duty to stabilise the economyPA WireFighting fires on all frontsIt’s not hard to spot the causes of the political kryptonite besetting a government which flew into office not yet a year ago on a handsome majority. Newcomers brought into the No\\u200910 team were aghast at how little policy preparation had been done for the enormity of fixing creaking welfare systems and enabling an upgrade of an NHS lagging in data, AI and technology advances. “We had a long time out of power and the Corbyn stint to boot, and we forgot what ‘good’ looks like,” one of the No\\u200910 delivery “boosters” brought in to amp up results confided to me. Add to that the relentless march of Reform in the local elections.Starmer took the fight to Nigel Farage’s economic recipe — “Liz Truss 2.0” — and asked if voters could trust Nigel. But it’s doubtful whether fighting rhetorical battles with a figure who thrives on conflict will change much at this point: when voters move towards more extreme solutions, they are signalling a lack of faith in the more orthodox alternatives. Simply telling them that they are falling for a charlatan doesn’t cure the root cause of disaffection.Starmer’s threat of an ‘island of strangers’ felt alien to the way a serious man would speakMeanwhile the PM’s strategy feels like the posture of a man trying to stay upright on one leg on a balance ball. He has also embraced aspects of Farage-ism in his own rhetoric — the threat of an “island of strangers” felt alien to the way a serious man would speak.By any standards, Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves have their hands full and new pressures, not least from a looming defence bill — no one close to this week’s slightly scrappy presentation of the UK’s options thinks that the three per cent target can be reached without substantial tax rises. But more and more MPs are voicing a preference for the kind of wealth-tax wielding plans of Angela Rayner — YouGov’s polling on Cabinet popularity this week (which is really a study in who is less unpopular than others) places her streets ahead, with Starmer and Reeves bottom of the pops. Reeves, who this week announced £15bn for trams, trains and buses outside London, has spent the past couple of weeks fending off bids for more cash from Rayner for housing, as well as Home Secretary Yvette Cooper and Energy Secretary Ed Miliband. And the PM has effectively “scooped” her decisions, by pledging to restore the winter fuel allowance to pensioners and suggesting that the cap on benefits and tax credits for families with more than two children will be removed to appease party ire.Rachel Reeves this week announced £15bn for trams, trains and buses outside LondonGetty ImagesDynamism turned to self-doubt It is not fun being the one person who has to learn to count in a government flailing to meet its pledges not to raise core taxes — and with a party (and increasingly, colleagues) which has never loved fiscal restraint. Half of Reeves’s £10\\u2009billion fiscal headroom to stick to her targets would disappear if the softenings Starmer proposes were fully reversed. Rises in NHS spending — a major plank of the Government’s plan to show real-world impact — are a done deal, which is why Wes Streeting, the cocksure Health Secretary, has a spring in his step. But even the fortunate in this unhappy house of government is a step away from someone else’s frustration. Streeting’s partner Joe Dancey, installed as the Labour Party’s main communications chief, has had a torrid few months of accusations that the party brand has become “soggy” (as one internal critic puts it).Starmer’s ‘can do’ attitude has gone missing, replaced by angsty self-doubt and blame-shiftingStarmer became Prime Minister, if not by accident, then certainly not by design — and succeeded. That sense of “can do” however has gone missing, replaced by angsty self-doubt and blame-shifting. The central remedy is for Starmer to decide more clearly what he wants his government to do — and what sacrifices he is prepared to make in personnel and policies to define it. Without that, he is missing what makes the “Prime” Minister truly prime.Anne McElvoy is co-host of the daily podcast, Politics at Sam and Anne’s', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Starmer-Reeves leadership faces internal rebellions\\nENTITIES: Rachel Reeves, Keir Starmer, Angela Rayner, Yvette Cooper, Ed Miliband, Wes Streeting, Joe Dancey, Nigel Farage\\nEVENT: The Starmer-Reeves leadership faces rebellions over benefit cuts and economic growth concerns, while struggling to meet spending pledges and define a clear government agenda amidst internal tensions and rising unpopularity.\\nCONTEXT: Labour government faces internal strife and policy challenges.', 'createdAt': '2025-06-05T08:04:47.658Z'}, {'id': 105488, 'sourceId': 12615, 'url': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14782233/Sussan-Ley-Alan-Stockdale-assertive-women-comments.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490', 'title': \"Sussan Ley hits back at Liberal Party elder who suggested women had become 'so assertive'\", 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T03:44:16.000Z', 'content': \"03:25, 05 Jun 2025, updated\\n04:44, 05 Jun 2025\\nBy\\nMAX AITCHISON\\nand\\nAAP\\nREAD MORE:\\xa0\\xa0Trump declares 'we don’t need them' as he signs bombshell travel ban restricting people from 19 countries\\nSussan Ley has encouraged 'assertive women' to join the Liberal Party after a former party executive complained about female assertiveness.The Opposition Leader condemned comments made by\\xa0Former federal president Alan Stockdale, 80, who reportedly claimed women had become 'so assertive' the party might need to consider measures to support men.'The women in this party are so assertive now that we may needs some special rules for men to get them preselected,' he told a meeting of the NSW Liberal Womens' Council on Tuesday, the Daily Telegraph\\xa0reported.Ley said there was 'nothing wrong with being an assertive woman'.\\xa0'The Liberal Party must reflect, respect and represent modern Australia and that means recognising the strength, merit and leadership of the women in our ranks,' she said in a statement.\\xa0It came after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese suggested the Liberal Party need to 'have a good look at themselves and their structures'.\\xa0Mr Stockdale, who was Treasurer of Victoria in the government of Jeff Kennett, later told the Telegraph it was 'a lighthearted but poorly chosen remark'.But that didn't stop senior Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie and former Labor premier for Queensland Anna Palaszczuk from joining forces to condemn his remarks.

And from late June, the whole city will go Cezanne mad, as the painter’s atelier, north of the centre, and the family home to the west reopen after an eight-year restoration.But during Cezanne’s lifetime, and for years after his death in 1906, Aix seemed at pains to ignore the artist later called the “father of modern art”. When his widow, Hortense, offered several paintings to the city’s main Musée Granet, director Henri Pontier declared that Cezanne paintings would enter the gallery only over his dead body.France mapThis year, however (with Pontier dead almost a century), Aix is making up for its neglect with a blockbuster exhibition at Musée Granet to accompany the unveiling of Cezanne’s studio and the estate bought by the artist’s family in 1859. The retrospective will bring together more than 130 works, including still lifes, portraits and landscapes.The paintings were all made in and around the Bastide du Jas de Bouffan, which was a refuge and inspiration for the painter for 40 years. Cezanne’s banker father acquired the 18th-century mansion with its farm and 15 hectares (37 acres) from a bankrupt client. Disappointed that his only son had no interest in finance, he still let young Paul use the ground floor grand salon as a workspace.Bastide du Jas de Bouffan; and, below, Cezanne’s depiction of the family home, painted c1885-7. Photograph: ITV Photograph: National Gallery Prague 2025By 2017, however, the house had fallen into disrepair and was closed for a long renovation. Its grand opening is on 28 June, but we grab a sneak preview. Though now in an Aix suburb (20 minutes from the centre, or a few minutes on bus no 8), it’s a charming place, three serene storeys in five hectares of verdant grounds, its shutters painted in Aix’s signature grey-blue.Inside, projections on the walls of the grand salon recreate the paintings (later chiselled off and sold) young Cezanne made on the walls, including a “four seasons” fresco. His card players series – one of which set a record in 2011 for the highest price ever paid for a work of art – was painted here, as was an 1866 portrait of Cezanne père reading a newspaper. (The artist and his family never used an accent on the first ‘e’ of their name: Cézanne seems to have been a later, Parisian invention.)The family later made a studio for Paul on the second floor, and its tall window, higher than the roofline, can be seen from the front. The kitchen and Madame Cezanne’s bedroom can also be visited.Daily guided tours of the interior (available in English) will cost from €9.50, but if these sell out, a ticket just for the grounds is still rewarding. For many fans, Cezanne’s genius lies in his outdoor works, and they come to life in the extensive gardens. There’s the chestnut avenue he painted, the farm buildings and, most evocative for me, the square bassin (pond) that features in dozens of pictures. I’m excited to spot the lion and dolphin statues seen in several canvases, the lions with their bums in the air. (The majestic plane trees and orangery were added by later owners.)After his father died in 1886 and the estate was sold, Cezanne built his atelier in Les Lauves, then a rural area north of Aix, with views to the mountain that had long been his muse, Mont Sainte-Victoire. The 1,000-metre-high limestone ridge can be viewed from many points, including the roof terrace of our hotel, the Escaletto (doubles from €105) on the edge of the old town.A painting by Cezanne of his muse, Mont Sainte-Victoire, with Gardanne in the foreground. Photograph: AlamyIt’s a 15-minute walk from here to the atelier, up a road now called Avenue Paul Cézanne. The traditional-style house sits on rising ground, with kitchen and living areas on the ground floor; the first floor is one huge, high-ceilinged studio, with a full-height, north-facing window. This was his last workplace, where he painted the Bathers series, one of which is in London’s National Gallery. After further renovations next winter, the lower floor will have displays including the artist’s coat, palette and satchel.If Aix had mixed feelings about its famous son, those seem to have been mutual. Of the 1,000-plus paintings Cezanne left, just one is of the city: a watercolour of the fountain in Place de la Mairie. However, he made hundreds in the countryside around, including over 80 of Mont Sainte-Victoire. So the best way to find Cezanne’s Provence is to get out of Aix.Between the city and the mountain is Bibémus quarry, source of the creamy ochre stone that has built Aix since Roman times. The bus trip there (no 6) is like a ride through a thousand paintings. These wooded hills are all protected, and daily tickets (from the tourist office) include a shuttle from the terminus at Les Trois Bons Dieux. What pictures can’t convey is the loud birdsong, southern heat and early summer scents of pine and broom.Cezanne made 27 paintings here, developing his pre-cubist style and trademark palette of blue, green and ochre. Reproductions of paintings around the quarry show the vantage point from which they were made – and their current homes: this one now in New York, others in San Francisco, Philadelphia, Baltimore …skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionUS tourists in Europe may not feel their homeland offers much to be proud of right now, but in Aix they can reflect with satisfaction that it was thanks to US collectors that Cezanne’s fame spread and his legacy was preserved. The atelier would have been demolished for housing had a group of US collectors not saved it in 1952. And an American artist, George Bunker, bought the Bibémus quarry in 1954 and left it to the city when he died in 1991, on condition that the land be protected and open to visitors.Canadian sculptor David Campbell, now in his late 80s, with wizard-like white hair, was a friend of Bunker’s and has lived here in a quarryman’s cottage for 40 years. We spy him exercising on the edge of the site and he later shows us some of his fluid works in white limestone, plus masterly recreations of medieval masonry.The Red Rock (c.1895, now in Paris’s Musée de l’Orangerie) is one of the best-known Cezanne quarry paintings, and the small post at the bottom left is still there today. But the site calls to my mind another in the National Gallery, with, unusually, a figure in white shirt and blue trousers dwarfed by a wall of orange rock.Visitors can also book a 6pm visit to Bibémus to enjoy the setting sun on Mont Sainte-Victoire (€17pp) or a half-day electric bike tour from Aix (€90pp including bike hire). The area may close unexpectedly, however, if mistral winds increase the risk of wildfires.Cezanne’s atelier, which narrowly avoided demolition in the 1950s. Photograph: Sophie SpitériOne town the artist did choose to paint is Gardanne, around seven miles from Aix (eight minutes by train). Here, Cezanne tourism is more informal. A plaque on the main street, Cours Forbin, shows where he lived with his wife and son for a productive year in 1885-6.Nearby Colline des Frères (Brothers’ Hill) was an open-air studio for Cezanne, and a free-to-visit walking route includes reproductions of paintings of his favourite mountain, with Gardanne and its bell tower in the foreground. (Power station cooling towers do detract slightly from today’s view.) Again, these works are almost all now in the US – one even in the White House. The local tourist office does guided tours (€10, in English) on Fridays in July and August.There are no hotels in Gardanne, but a self-catering let meant we could make the most of the extensive street market under towering plane trees on Cours Forbin (Weds, Fri and Sun).I’m pleased to learn that the square blobs on the right of at least two of Cezanne’s Gardanne paintings are windmills, which still stand. We climb north up Cativel hill and find three mills, one still with its sails, and the date 1567 over the door. They’re on a gorgeous rolling hillside glowing in Cezanne colours, with interlocking shadows of umbrella pines completing the painterly scene.Aix may be all about Cezanne this year, but closer encounters may well be found off the main tourist trail.', 'location': 'FRA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Aix celebrates Cezanne with exhibition, site reopenings\\nENTITIES: Paul Cezanne, Aix-en-Provence, Musée Granet, Bastide du Jas de Bouffan, Mont Sainte-Victoire\\nEVENT: Aix-en-Provence is hosting a major Cezanne retrospective at Musée Granet and reopening Cezanne's studio and family estate after restoration.\\nCONTEXT: Aix-en-Provence celebrates Cezanne with retrospective exhibition and restored sites.\", 'createdAt': '2025-06-05T08:04:47.658Z'}, {'id': 105196, 'sourceId': 12852, 'url': 'https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3313104/liaison-office-change-hong-kong-all-about-focusing-economy-analysts-say', 'title': 'Liaison office change in Hong Kong all about focusing on economy, analysts say', 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T01:59:27.000Z', 'content': 'Beijing’s new liaison office chief in Hong Kong, Zhou Ji, has already distinguished himself from his predecessors, just five days into the job.Breaking with tradition, Zhou made his first public appearance by carrying out community visits to Sham Shui Po and Tsing Yi, two days after being appointed as director on Friday.

They were protesting legislation that would have reinterpreted the country’s 184-year-old founding document, a treaty that was signed between colonial British rulers and Indigenous Māori.A parliamentary committee found the three lawmakers in contempt of parliament last month and recommended that they be suspended for up to three weeks “for acting in a manner that could have the effect of intimidating a member of the House.”Debbie Ngarewa-Packer and Rawiri Waititi, co-leaders of Te Pāti Māori, the Māori party, which holds six of Parliament’s 123 seats, were suspended for three weeks each. Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke, who at 22 is New Zealand’s youngest legislator, was suspended for one week on the recommendation of the committee, which said in its report that she had demonstrated “some level of contrition” in her written statement.The vote was 68-55 against Maipi-Clarke, 68-54 against Ngarewa-Packer and 68-53 against Waititi, all of whom were suspended immediately.Waititi told reporters after the vote that he and his colleagues would “continue to be the voices our people expect us to be.”“They are demonizing haka,” he said of the lawmakers who voted for the suspensions. “They are making us out to be violent, to be disruptive, and our people have heard that for a long, long time.”It is rare for New Zealand lawmakers to receive such suspensions, which are unpaid, and the longest anyone had previously been suspended was three days. The opposition Labour Party as well as the Green Party criticized the suspensions as disproportionate, with the Labour Party proposing censure instead. The three lawmakers performed the protest haka in November during the reading of a bill that would have redefined the Treaty of Waitangi. Signed in 1840 between the British Crown and Māori chiefs, the treaty established British governance and structures to protect Māori rights and continues to influence policy today. The legislation was brought by the small libertarian party ACT New Zealand, which said the treaty had been misinterpreted to give Māori people special treatment. Critics of the bill, which was defeated in April, said it would undo decades of progress for Māori, who make up about 20% of New Zealand’s 5 million people and fare worse than the rest of the population in health, education and the criminal justice system.One of the Māori lawmakers, Maipi-Clarke, led the haka by tearing up a copy of the bill, joined by other Māori members and some visitors in the public gallery. Video of the protest went viral and gathered hundreds of millions of views across social media.Some lawmakers objected to the way their Māori colleagues advanced toward them across the floor. “This was a very serious incident, the likes of which I have never seen before in my 23 years in the debating chamber,” said Judith Collins of the center-right National Party, chair of the parliamentary committee that issued the report.She added that the lawmakers had performed the haka without permission and that the disruption had suspended legislative proceedings for 30 minutes.The three Māori lawmakers declined to appear before the committee during its investigation, citing disrespect for their cultural traditions. Their party said the way it was being conducted was “grossly unjust” and that “this was not about process, this became personal.”The committee said the lawmakers were being sanctioned not for performing the haka, but for “the time at and manner in which it was performed.” It said the severity of the sanctions was intended to “leave members in no doubt that the behavior discussed is not acceptable.”The vote had originally been scheduled for last month but was postponed so that the three Māori lawmakers could participate in debate over the federal budget.Performing haka in Parliament is not uncommon, and is typically seen when Māori members celebrate the passage of a particular bill. The dance is known abroad for being performed at matches by New Zealand’s rugby teams, and variations of it are also performed at funerals and formal welcomes.“It would have been clearly understood by everyone in the parliament that this was a peaceful act of protest done in a way that aligns with Māori tradition,” said Julian Rawiri Kusabs, a Māori historian and researcher at the University of Melbourne in Australia.Kusabs said the suspension was a setback in decades of reconciliation efforts between the New Zealand government and Māori communities, whose members have had to navigate “a highly complex and frequently painful relationship” even to achieve representation in Parliament. The suspension, he said, reinforces the longstanding perception that “Māori culture is not equally respected within New Zealand’s formal institutions of governance.”Julia ZhongJulia Zhong\\xa0is an intern on\\xa0NBC News's\\xa0Asia Desk.Mithil AggarwalMithil Aggarwal is a Hong Kong-based reporter/producer for NBC News.\", 'location': 'NZL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Māori lawmakers suspended for protest haka\\nENTITIES: Māori, New Zealand Parliament, Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, Rawiri Waititi, Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke, Te Pāti Māori\\nEVENT: Three Māori lawmakers were suspended from New Zealand's Parliament for performing a protest haka against a bill reinterpreting the Treaty of Waitangi.\\nCONTEXT: Suspensions highlight tensions between Māori culture and governance.\", 'createdAt': '2025-06-05T08:04:47.658Z'}, {'id': 103861, 'sourceId': 919, 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/jun/05/australia-news-live-matt-kean-climate-target-jeremy-rockliff-tasmania-no-confidence-nicolette-boele-bradfield-ntwnfb', 'title': 'Day of high drama in Tasmanian politics – as it happened', 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T07:34:33.000Z', 'content': 'Key events2h agoWhat happened Thursday 5 June, 20252h agoNSW parliament bans public-private partnerships for hospitals2h agoRockliff to go to governor on Tuesday to ask for election3h agoRockliff arrives at Government House to ask for early Tasmanian election5h agoTasmania passes vote of no confidence in premier Jeremy Rockliff6h agoWinter is here: BoM confirms coldest days of the year in Sydney7h agoLiberals will vote against Labor’s super tax plan, O’Brien says7h agoMan dies after being hit by tram in Sydney7h agoDfat providing assistance to man detained in Bali9h agoCity of Perth suspends e-scooter hire schemes after man dies9h agoSarah Hanson-Young says it would be ‘honourable’ for Dorinda Cox to resign11h agoSussan Ley says there’s ‘nothing wrong with being an assertive woman’11h agoTasmanian premier Jeremy Rockliff says he will move to call election if no-confidence motion passes11h agoFormer Liberal party president sparks ire after saying party women are ‘so assertive now’12h agoHundreds attend vigil for man who died in police custody in Alice Springs last month13h agoQueensland nurses to launch their first industrial action in 23 years today13h agoNicolette Boele relishes victory in Bradfield after long recount14h agoGood morningShow key events onlyPlease turn on JavaScript to use this featureWhat happened Thursday 5 June, 2025With that, we’ll end our live coverage of the day’s news.

Local community hospitals that are designed to provide services to public patients should be part of the public health system.”\\nYou can read more about Joe’s law in this piece from health reporter Natasha May here:Rockliff to go to governor on Tuesday to ask for electionTasmanian premier Jeremy Rockliff has said the state’s parliament will resume next Tuesday to pass supply bills to ensure essential services the government is responsible for are funded, before an election is called.Rockliff will then meet with the government of Tasmania to request that an election be called.The premier was speaking outside government house in Tasmania hours after parliament passed a vote of no confidence in him.Rockliff accused opposition leader, Dean Winter, of taking a “wrecking ball” to parliament “and effectively the Tasmanian people”.“[It’s been] quite a day for all of us and for all Tasmanians, and a day that I did not want to come to this point, but it has,” Rockliff said.Albanese stands firm in trade talks to get ‘damn fine’ products into EuropeAustralia has stood firm in free trade negotiations with the European Union in the new environment of Donald Trump’s tariffs.Trade minister Don Farrell walked away from the bloc’s previous offer following rounds of negotiations because it failed to give Australian agricultural products greater market access, which remains the sticking point.Farrell met face-to-face with the EU’s trade commissioner, Maros Sefcovic, for the first time on Wednesday, on the sidelines of an OECD meeting in Paris.Anthony Albanese said there was bipartisan support for free and fair trade.The PM said:\\nWe will seek a deal that is good enough for Australia.\\nIf it benefits us, we’ll be in it. If it doesn’t, we’ll continue to not sign up to something that is not in our national interest.”\\nAlbanese said Australia’s free trade agreement with the UK had led to an increase in meat exports, in addition to wine.“Why is that the case? Because our products are damn fine and they are in demand right around the world,” he said.Australian Association PressAnthony Albanese says Australia’s products are in demand around the world. Photograph: Richard Wainwright/AAPRockliff arrives at Government House to ask for early Tasmanian electionAdam MortonThe Tasmanian premier, Jeremy Rockliff, has arrived at Government House to ask for an early state election after the parliament passed a motion of no confidence in him earlier today.He will be meeting the state’s chief justice and lieutenant governor, Christpher Shanahan. The governor, Barbara Baker, is not in the state.Rockliff’s car has just passed through the gates of Government House, on the Queens Domain.It is unclear whether the acting governor will accept Rockliff’s advice or consider other options for this parliament to continue. The Labor leader, Dean Winter, has said he would not form a minority government that relied on the support of the Greens.It is just 15 months since the last election. The Liberals have 14 seats, Labor 10, the Greens five and there are six other crossbenchers.Psephologist Kevin Bonham said the earliest possible election date was 12 July.There is another potential issue that needs to be resolved.Parliament is likely to need to pass a temporary supply bill to ensure government services can continue to function during an election campaign as the budget introduced last Thursday has not been passed. The lieutenant-governor could appoint Rockliff as acting premier for a sitting to pass the supply bill.Jonathan BarrettRental crisis eases for inner city tenantsSome renters have received a reprieve from years of relentless increases, with rents falling in about one-third of suburbs around Australia over the last quarter, according to market data company PropTrack.The falls were steepest in inner-city areas, where investors have been buying properties, adding rental stock to the market.Median rents in Australia’s biggest city, Sydney, have fallen in about one-third of suburbs, in line with the national average.The PropTrack economist Anne Flaherty said: “While an increase in investor activity is bad news for owner occupier buyers who are competing with investors, it does help add to the stock of rental properties.”Overall, rents have still trended higher across the country over the past quarter, although the pace of increases has slowed.Tenants have suffered the brunt of the cost-of-living crisis amid a tight supply of housing that has led to sharp increases in rent.PropTrack data shows that Sydney renters are paying an average of $13,000 a year more now than they were five years ago. After a brief lull, home prices have started to rise again, fuelled by lower interest rates.Man charged over mini pistol in luggage at Perth airportA Western Australian man travelling through Perth airport has been detected allegedly carrying a foldable pistol in his backpack.The man was charged with allegedly carrying a foldable pistol in his luggage, after federal police – who have jurisdiction in airports – were notified on Wednesday that airport security had allegedly found a firearm during an X-ray screening of a passenger’s backpack.“Police searched the backpack and found an unlicensed foldable single-shot pistol weighing less than 1kg. No ammunition was found in the luggage or in the man’s possession,” police said.The 37-year-old was charged with one count of possessing an unlicensed handgun; and one count of carrying a weapon through a screening point.The maximum penalty for each offence is seven years’ imprisonment. The man was scheduled to appear before Perth magistrates court on Thursday.The AFP Det Acting Supt Peter Brindal said “carrying a firearm in an airport is a serious offence”.\\nSecurity screening staff at the airport were vigilant and, along with AFP officers, acted quickly to ensure the safety of the travelling public and stop weapons entering the aviation environment.\\nChristopher KnausAttorneys general are considering if reform needed on child abuse liabilityThe nation’s attorneys general are considering whether reforms are needed following a high court decision limiting the liability of churches and other institutions for child abuse.The high court ruled last year that the Catholic church couldn’t be held vicariously liable for abuse committed by a parish priest because the priest wasn’t a formal employee of the church.The ruling had broad consequences in limiting institutions from being held vicariously liable for abuse committed by individuals who are associated with them but are not considered formal employees, such as parish priests and volunteers.The ruling has prompted multiple crossbench attempts for reform, including in Victoria and New South Wales, attempting to extend the concept of vicarious liability to “persons akin to employees”.NSW finance minister Courtney Houssos. Photograph: Bianca de Marchi/AAPA bill by Jeremy Buckingham, a NSW upper house crossbencher, was voted down on Wednesday night. In voting down the bill, the state finance minister, Courtney Houssos, revealed the issue was being considered by the standing council of attorneys general, a body comprising federal and state attorneys general. She said:\\nThe Standing Council of Attorneys-General is the most appropriate forum for consideration of the impacts of this decision, and the New South Wales Government believes we should not progress reforms ahead of this process.\\nIt is important that all jurisdictions are given the opportunity to consider potential reform options as any changes in this space would benefit from a uniform national approach, if possible, to ensure that victim-survivors across Australia have equal opportunities to seek justice.\\nAny reforms progressed in this sensitive area of law must also be developed in close consultation with key legal stakeholders and victim-survivors to ensure that there are no unintended consequences.\\nThorpe says PM ‘should have done his homework’ before saying bullying in parliament not an ongoing issueConversation turns to Dorinda Cox’s defection to the Labor party, which followed Lidia Thorpe leaving the Greens to become an independent prior to the last election.Asked if the Greens have a “problem with Indigenous women”, Thorpe says the two senators left the party for “very different reasons”, particularly on the referendum and her stance on the voice to parliament.\\nThe Greens still have … a staunch and active group of blackfellas from around the country, so as long as they have the Blak Greens I think they just need to listen to them and they will be able to get it right eventually.\\nIt is disappointing to see Senator Cox go to the Labor party to become a backbencher that obviously will not have a voice and no say in policy development.\\nThorpe confirms she made a complaint with the parliamentary workplace support scheme in relation to Cox because the PM “told the people of this country that there was no ongoing issues with bullying and he was wrong”.\\nHe should have done his homework before he opened his mouth because there is still an ongoing issue with bullying in the workplace and there is a lot of work to do and Labor need to take that seriously.\\nYou cannot force people to mediate, so I am always open to a conversation and conciliation, so until that happens, it is still open.\\nAsked if Cox should resign, Thorpe says that’s for her to decide, “not for me”.Cox’s office was approached for comment on Thorpe’s allegations but referred Guardian Australia to the prime minister’s media team, which did not respond to questions.Cox has been the subject of a number of workplace behaviour complaints, as first reported by the Nine newspapers last October. At the time, the WA senator apologised for “the distress this may have caused” but said there had been “significant missing context” in the reports of bullying allegations within her office.‘It just has to stop’: Thorpe calls for action on Aboriginal deaths in custody after death of Warlpiri manThe independent senator Lidia Thorpe is appearing on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing after revelations she made a bullying complaint about the former Greens senator Dorinda Cox which remains unresolved.First, she is asked about the death of Warlpiri man Kumanjayi White in police custody in Alice Springs last week.Thorpe says the federal government needs to “take very seriously” what community members have been calling for, which is an independent investigation into his death, rather than “cops investigating cops”.\\nIt is very clear that we have had so many deaths in custody, almost 600 deaths in custody, and nobody ever is held accountable for any of those deaths. We need to enact those royal commission recommendations from 1991 which clearly states that we need independence and accountability of these killings … it is another member of the Yuendumu community who has lost their life at the hands of the police.\\nThorpe adds that state, territory and federal governments have worked together on issues such as vaping, kids on social media and the pandemic.\\nWhy can’t we call the state and territories together on stopping Aboriginal deaths in custody? It just cannot continue. Our families and communities are reeling in the trauma every time we lose somebody in our communities.

With certain exemptions, Mr. Trump\\'s order bans citizens of those countries seeking to come to the U.S. permanently as legal immigrants, as well as temporary visa holders, like tourists.\\nThe president also partially suspended the entry of travelers and immigrants from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. That part of his proclamation applies to all prospective immigrants from these countries with visas to settle in the U.S. permanently and certain temporary visa holders.The ban is set to take effect at 12:01 a.m. on Monday, June 9.\\xa0Mr. Trump said the sweeping entry restrictions were necessary to address concerns related to terrorism in the countries listed in the order, inadequate vetting of the affected nationals and the lack of cooperation on deportations among some of the nations.\"President Trump is fulfilling his promise to protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors that want to come to our country and cause us harm. These commonsense restrictions are country-specific and include places that lack proper vetting, exhibit high visa overstay rates, or fail to share identity and threat information. President Trump will always act in the best of interest of the American people and their safety,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told CBS News.Mr. Trump\\'s decree contains certain exemptions, including for U.S. permanent residents, the spouses and children of U.S. citizens who have \"clear and convincing evidence of identity and family relationship,\" Afghans who assisted American forces and have special visas, diplomats, athletes and dual nationals with a passport from a country not listed in his proclamation.The announcement of the ban follows an attack Sunday in Boulder, Colorado, on marchers raising attention for Israelis taken hostage by Hamas. The suspect was identified by U.S. officials as an Egyptian national who had overstayed his tourist visa.\\nWhile Mr. Trump did not place any restrictions on the entry of Egyptian nationals, his proclamation directed officials to assess the \"adequacy\" of Egypt\\'s vetting policies, \"in light of recent events.\"In a video statement released by the White House Wednesday night, Mr. Trump said the Boulder attack \"underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted, as well as those who come here as temporary visitors and overstay their visas. We don\\'t want them.\"\\xa0He said the list could be revised if countries make material improvements, and new countries could be added as threats emerge.\\xa0Mr. Trump\\'s actions echo a series of travel bans issued during his first administration that initially targeted predominantly Muslim countries. Like those orders, his latest proclamation could be subject to lawsuits.In the first month of his first term, January 2017, Mr. Trump signed a travel ban restricting the entry of most citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The move triggered widespread outcry, chaos at airports and legal challenges from advocates who argued the ban was discriminatory.\\nIn March 2017, Mr. Trump removed Iraq from the list and added Chad, Venezuela and North Korea. In 2020, he expanded the ban, adding immigration restrictions for nationals of Nigeria, Eritrea, Sudan, Tanzania, Myanmar and Kyrgyzstan. Chad was later removed from the list.The third version of Mr. Trump\\'s first-term ban was ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court in the summer of 2018, with the conservative justices citing the president\\'s broad authority to restrict the entry of foreigners on national security grounds.

The ban, which goes into effect on Monday, bars travel to the United States by citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. And it limits travel from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.Here are some of the exemptions:Green card holders: People with green cards — individuals who have a pathway to U.S. citizenship — are exempted from the ban. When a travel ban was introduced by Mr. Trump during his first term in 2017, chaos and confusion ensued at airports. The Department of Homeland Security had to put out a statement clarifying that green card holders could enter the country. This time, the administration is making that exemption clear in the order itself.Dual citizens: People who are American citizens but also hold citizenship with a banned country are exempt under the order.Those seeking visas through connections to U.S. family members: Immigrants from the banned countries who seek visas through connections to their spouses, children, or parents who are American citizens will still be able to apply for them.Certain athletes: Athletes and coaches traveling to the United States to play in major sporting events, along with their families, will still be allowed into the country, despite the ban. The United States is one of the hosts of the World Cup in 2026, and Los Angeles is the site of the Summer Olympics in 2028. This exception will allow soccer players from targeted countries, like Iran, to enter the United States for the World Cup.Refugees granted asylum: Those who have been admitted as refugees or were granted asylum are exempted under the order.Afghans who helped the U.S.: The order exempts Afghans who seek to enter the U.S. under a special visa program for those helped the U.S. government during the two decades of war after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.Iranians fleeing religious persecution: Iranians who are escaping the country because they belong to a religious minority, like Christianity, are also exempted.Hamed Aleaziz covers the Department of Homeland Security and immigration policy for The Times.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Trump Imposes New Travel Ban; Exceptions Apply\\nENTITIES: Donald Trump, Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, Venezuela, United States, Department of Homeland Security\\nEVENT: President Trump signed a travel ban restricting citizens from 12 countries, mainly in Africa and the Middle East, from entering the United States, while also limiting travel from several other countries.\\nCONTEXT: The ban impacts citizens of specific countries, with exceptions for green card holders, dual citizens, athletes, refugees, and those who aided the U.S.', 'createdAt': '2025-06-05T08:04:47.658Z'}, {'id': 105829, 'sourceId': 12651, 'url': 'https://www.express.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/2064573/hmrc-urgently-sending-letters-100-000-people-after-breach', 'title': \"HMRC urgently sending letters to 100,000 people after 'breach'\", 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T05:43:00.000Z', 'content': 'HMRC has lost £47 million after a phishing scam breached tens of thousands of tax accounts, a group of MPs has heard By\\xa0Steven Smith, Content Editor 06:43, Thu, Jun 5, 2025 | UPDATED: 06:45, Thu, Jun 5, 2025 Letters will arrive within three weeks, HMRC said (Image: Getty Images)HMRC has suffered a loss of £47 million due to a phishing scam that breached tens of thousands of tax accounts, MPs have been informed.Two high-ranking civil servants from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) disclosed to the Treasury Committee that 100,000 individuals have been or are being contacted after their accounts were compromised in what they described as an \"organised crime\" incident which commenced last year.John-Paul Marks, the chief executive of HMRC, assured that taxpayers affected by this breach will endure \"no financial loss\".Mr Marks informed the Committee: \"It\\'s about 0.2% of the PAYE population, around 100,000 people, who we have written to, are writing to, to notify them that we detected activity on their PAYE account.\"When questioned if this pertained to individual workers\\' PAYE accounts rather than companies, he confirmed: \"That\\'s right, individuals. To be clear, no financial loss to those individuals.\"The letter will go to around 100,000 people (Image: Getty Images)Mr Marks added: \"This was organised crime phishing for identity data outwith of HMRC systems, so stuff that banks and others will also unfortunately experience, and then trying to use that data to create PAYE accounts to pay themselves a repayment and/or access an existing account.\"An investigation into the incident, which occurred last year and involved \"including jurisdictions outside the UK\", resulted in \"some arrests last year,\" Mr Marks revealed to MPs.Angela MacDonald, HMRC\\'s deputy chief executive and second permanent secretary, said: \"At the moment, they\\'ve managed to extract repayments to the tune of £47 million.\"Now that is a lot of money, and it\\'s very unacceptable. We have overall, in the last tax year, we actually protected £1.9 billion worth of money which sought to be taken from us by attacks.\"MacDonald emphasised that the incident was not due to a cyber attack, stating: \"not a cyber attack, we have not been hacked, we have not had data extracted from us\".She further clarified: \"The ability for somebody to breach your systems and to extract data, to hold you to ransomware and all of those things, that is a cyber attack. That is not what has happened here.\"HMRC said it had taken swift action by securing the compromised accounts and erasing log-in credentials to thwart any further unauthorised entries. The agency has also corrected any erroneous information on tax records and verified that no other details were altered.Impacted people can expect to receive a letter from HMRC within the next three weeks. In a separate issue, Mr Marks informed MPs that HMRC phone lines experienced downtime on Wednesday afternoon, but assured this was merely \"coincidental\" and normal service would resume \"back up and available in the morning\".

But he has hinted that this era of live performance may mark the final chapter of his large-scale concert tours.\"I’ve got no interest in retiring,\" he told AARP in a recent sit-down. \"But these shows will probably be the last big ones I do. I want to go out with a bang, not a fizzle.\"© GettyRod Stewart onstage at the 2025 American Music AwardsThat philosophy is clear in how he maintains himself—mentally and physically. With the help of a trainer he’s worked with for 38 years, Rod keeps up an intense fitness regimen at home, complete with a private gym, indoor pool, and even his own running track.\\xa0Rod Stewart: 5 surprising facts\\xa0© Shutterstock1. Largest free concertRod staged the largest free rock concert ever in Rio de Janeiro in 1994, performing in front of over 4 million people.2. Most successful songAmongst his many songs, Rod\\'s top-selling single is \\'Maggie May\\', released in 1971. The song launched his career and reached number one in the UK.\\xa03. Two-time cancer survivorRod was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in May 2000, and he underwent surgery in the same month. Then, in 2017 he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, but after having treatment, he was given the all-clear.\\xa04. High net worthIt\\'s no surprise that Rod has made money with his successful career and his net worth is estimated at around £179 million.5. Son-father arrestIn 2019, Rod and his son Sean were arrested in Florida over a dispute with a security guard at a hotel. The guard allegedly denied them access to a private party on New Year\\'s Eve. Rod pleaded guilty to charges of \\'\\'simple battery\\'\\' but was not found guilty.\\xa0\"I got it down to 19 seconds by learning how to push off,\" he said, referring to sprinting 100 metres on his track. \"I’m going to try and do 17 seconds, which I think is a world record for an 80-year-old.\"© GettyRod with his wife PennyRod also shared details of the unconventional training exercises that help him stay in shape: \"We do a lot of underwater training, where the trainer throws a brick into the pool and I have to dive in, push the brick to the end of the pool, and come up.\"Such discipline has undoubtedly contributed to his longevity, both on and off the stage. Just days before the cancellations, Rod appeared at the American Music Awards, proudly accepting the Lifetime Achievement Award surrounded by his children. Visibly moved, he admitted to being \"flabbergasted\" by the honour—a poignant moment for a man who has given his all to music across six decades.', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Rod Stewart cancels show due to illness\\nENTITIES: Rod Stewart, Caesars Palace, Las Vegas\\nEVENT: Rod Stewart canceled a Las Vegas show due to the flu, following an earlier postponement.\\nCONTEXT: Stewart's health concerns raise questions about future performances.\", 'createdAt': '2025-06-05T08:04:47.658Z'}, {'id': 107019, 'sourceId': 903, 'url': 'https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/foreign-office-alert-47-countries-35339314', 'title': 'Foreign Office alert for 47 countries over airport arrests - full list', 'publishDate': '2025-06-05T07:19:56.000Z', 'content': \"Officials issued new advice in the wake of a number of high profile cases involving UK citizens08:19, 05 Jun 2025The Foreign Office today issues a serious warning for people travelling to 47 countries from the UK - and added ‘expecgt severe penalties’.

In one update for Spain the Foreign Office warned: “Illegal drugs, including cannabis, carry severe penalties. You should expect a long jail sentence and heavy fines for possessing, using or smuggling illegal drugs, including when transiting through airports.

Although these have been referred to as “weight-loss injections”, not all are authorised for weight loss.The MHRA said Mounjaro may reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives such as the pill in people who are overweight, and that women taking the medication should use barrier contraceptives such as condoms. It said it had received 26 pregnancy-related reports for Mounjaro.Last year the Guardian reported that the popularity of weight-loss drugs had resulted in an unexpected baby boom. The Facebook group “I got pregnant on Ozempic” had more than 750 members at the time.The MHRA said there had been eight reports relating to pregnancy in those taking semaglutide and nine reports for liraglutide, which is found in another weight-loss drug, Saxenda. Although it is not necessary for women in the reports to say if the pregnancy was unintentional, two of these reports said the pregnancy was such.The watchdog also said these drugs must not be taken during pregnancy, while trying to get pregnant or while breastfeeding, as there was “not enough safety data to know whether taking the medicine could cause harm to the baby”.It said that in some instances women should continue using contraception for up to two months between stopping the medicine and trying to get pregnant.Dr Channa Jayasena, a consultant in reproductive endocrinology and andrology at Imperial College healthcare NHS trust, said: “GLP-1 drugs copy the natural hormones made in the gut which make you feel full. This makes them powerful treatments to help women lose weight.“Obesity reduces fertility in women. So, women with obesity taking GLP-1 drugs are more likely to get pregnant than before they lost weight.“In addition, we think that the absorption of oral contraceptive pills may be reduced with GLP-1 drugs which slow down emptying of the stomach, though more research is needed to confirm this.“The guidance produced by the MHRA is sensible, since it highlights that women could accidentally get pregnant when taking GLP-1 drugs.“We don’t know how harmful GLP-1 drugs are during pregnancy; however, we know that other forms of weight loss like weight-loss surgery can increase chances of a miscarriage. So women are advised to do all they can to prevent pregnancy while taking GLP-1 drugs.”Dr Alison Cave, the MHRA’s chief safety officer, said: “Skinny jabs are medicines licensed to treat specific medical conditions and should not be used as aesthetic or cosmetic treatments. They are not a quick fix to lose weight and have not been assessed to be safe when used in this way.“Our guidance offers patients a one-stop shop for our up-to-date advice on how to use these powerful medicines safely.“This guidance should not be used as a substitute to reading the patient information leaflet or having a conversation with a healthcare professional as part of the prescribing process.”', 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Weight-loss drugs linked to unexpected pregnancies\\nENTITIES: MHRA, Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, Dr Channa Jayasena, Dr Alison Cave\\nEVENT: The MHRA issued an alert after receiving 40 reports of pregnancies in women using weight-loss drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro.

The so-called deferred enforced departure gives Ms. Hui a reprieve but does not guarantee her future in the United States.“By no means are we in the clear,” Mr. Bolourtchi said. “But at this point I’m optimistic. It’s an immediate sigh of relief.”Ms. Hui, who was born in Hong Kong, entered the United States 20 years ago on a short-term tourist visa and stayed long past its expiration, in the process building a life, having three children and becoming a beloved waitress serving waffles and hugs to the breakfast crowd at a diner in Kennett, a rural farming town in the Bootheel of Missouri.She was ordered deported more than a decade ago but had been able to stay in the country through a series of temporary permissions from the immigration authorities that ended abruptly with her arrest in late April.On Wednesday, the news of her release buzzed through the city of 10,000. Residents attending a City Council meeting asked each other: “Is Carol really out?” “Is she coming home?”“I didn’t think it could really happen,” said Lisa Dry, a city councilwoman who called for Ms. Hui’s release.The staff of John’s Waffle and Pancake House was elated. The diner, a morning mainstay in Kennett, rallied the community to bring attention to her story. Her co-workers organized a “Carol Day” fund-raiser, put petitions to free her on every table and swapped out the servers’ shirts with black-and-yellow T-shirts that read, “Bring Carol Home.”“It took a whole village,” said Liradona Ramadani, whose family runs the restaurant.Ms. Hui’s story drew widespread attention as it raced from the waffle house to the local newspaper, The Delta Dunklin Democrat, and beyond. The musician Sheryl Crow, who grew up in Kennett and whose name is on a sign announcing Kennett as her hometown, posted an Instagram message in support of Ms. Hui.The public outrage and backlash to Ms. Hui’s arrest was remarkable in a town like Kennett, the seat of a rural county where 80 percent of voters supported Mr. Trump last November, and where many voters said they had supported his promises of mass deportations.But many in Kennett said Ms. Hui should not have been apprehended. To them, she was not a gang member or a criminal alien. She was a mother of three they talked with at soccer and Little League games, who served them waffles and egg skillets, who cleaned houses as a side job and went to Sunday Mass at the local Catholic church.Mr. Bolourtchi, Ms. Hui’s lawyer, had tried to get her yearslong immigration case reopened after she was arrested in April and said he had been preparing to file a federal lawsuit directly challenging her detention. Before he could, he said, a federal immigration official recommended that Ms. Hui be released under the deferred enforced departure program.She next has to check in with the authorities on June 25. A spokesman with Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not immediately reply to a request for comment about her release.Mr. Bolourtchi said her release “never would have happened without her community standing behind her.” And on Wednesday, one of her neighbors made the four-hour drive to the jail where she was being held, to drive her back to Kennett.Dozens of residents gathered at the diner’s parking lot, where they applauded and hugged Ms. Hui as she pulled into town at about 9 p.m., said Steve Hankins, the local reporter who first covered her story. Among them were Ms. Hui’s partner and three children.Jack Healy is a Phoenix-based national correspondent for The Times who focuses on the politics and climate of the Southwest.

      "Sending converted contents format: [{'role': 'user', 'parts': [{'text': 'You are an expert news analyst AI tasked with refining a set of automatically generated news clusters. You will receive a list of clusters, each identified by an ID, a title, and a list of associated article titles.\\n\\nYour primary goal is to identify clusters that should be **merged** because they represent different facets or developments of the *same core story or event*, rather than distinct narratives. Use the following rule of thumb: **\"If analyzing the articles in Cluster A would feel incomplete or artificially separated from the articles in Cluster B because they fundamentally describe the same specific event, ongoing situation, or central topic, they should be merged.\"**\\n\\nDistinguish this from clusters that are merely *related* thematically but cover different specific events, angles, or sub-topics that *can* stand alone as separate stories, even if they might be linked later in analysis. For example:\\n\\n*   **Merge Candidate Example:** Cluster 1 covers the initial report of a factory fire. Cluster 2 covers the emergency response and evacuation related to *that same fire*. Cluster 3 covers the investigation into the cause of *that same fire*. These are facets of the *same core story* (the factory fire event) and should likely be merged.\\n*   **Keep Separate Example:** Cluster 1 covers a new trade agreement signed between Country X and Country Y. Cluster 2 covers protests *within* Country X about the economic impact of *that trade agreement*. While related, the signing event and the domestic protest are distinct stories/angles that could be analyzed separately. Cluster 3 covers a *different* trade dispute Country X has with Country Z – clearly a separate story.\\n\\nYour secondary goal is to identify clusters that should be **filtered out** before further processing. **Filtering should be used sparingly**, primarily to remove noise and maintain data quality, not to judge the importance of a story. The aim is to retain a record of all distinct, coherent events, even routine or smaller ones. Filter *only* if a cluster meets one of these specific criteria:\\n*   **Very Low Article Count:** Contains **fewer than 3 articles**, indicating it likely doesn\\'t represent a sufficiently developed or distinct event captured in the data.\\n*   **Incoherent or Noise:** The articles within the cluster do not form a coherent topic, or the cluster appears to be noise/junk data.\\n*   **Strict Duplicate:** The cluster covers the *exact same specific event* as another cluster, often with significant overlap in articles, making it redundant. (Do not filter merely *related* clusters).\\n*   **Clearly Irrelevant:** The content is demonstrably not related to news events (e.g., advertisements, site navigation links clustered together).\\n\\n**Input Format:**\\n\\nThe input will be structured text as follows:\\n\\n```\\n# ID: [Cluster ID 1] - [Cluster Title 1]\\n  - [Article Title 1a]\\n  - [Article Title 1b]\\n  - [Article Title 1c]\\n  ...\\n\\n# ID: [Cluster ID 2] - [Cluster Title 2]\\n  - [Article Title 2a]\\n  - [Article Title 2b]\\n  - [Article Title 2c]\\n  ...\\n\\n[... more clusters ...]\\n```\\n*(Note: Cluster IDs in the input might be strings or numbers, please preserve them as strings in the JSON output).*\\n\\n**Output Requirements:**\\n\\nYour output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON object containing two keys: `merges` and `filters`.\\n\\n1.  **`merges`**: An array of objects. Each object represents a single merge operation and must contain:\\n    *   `cluster_ids_to_merge`: An array of strings, listing the original Cluster IDs that should be merged together.\\n    *   `reason`: A brief string explaining *why* these clusters belong together based on the \"same core story\" principle.\\n    *   `suggested_new_title`: A string proposing a suitable title for the newly merged cluster.\\n\\n2.  **`filters`**: An array of objects.

    "You are an expert news analyst AI tasked with refining a set of automatically generated news clusters. You will receive a list of clusters, each identified by an ID, a title, and a list of associated article titles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your primary goal is to identify clusters that should be **merged** because they represent different facets or developments of the *same core story or event*, rather than distinct narratives. Use the following rule of thumb: **\"If analyzing the articles in Cluster A would feel incomplete or artificially separated from the articles in Cluster B because they fundamentally describe the same specific event, ongoing situation, or central topic, they should be merged.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "Distinguish this from clusters that are merely *related* thematically but cover different specific events, angles, or sub-topics that *can* stand alone as separate stories, even if they might be linked later in analysis. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Merge Candidate Example:** Cluster 1 covers the initial report of a factory fire. Cluster 2 covers the emergency response and evacuation related to *that same fire*. Cluster 3 covers the investigation into the cause of *that same fire*. These are facets of the *same core story* (the factory fire event) and should likely be merged.\n",
    "*   **Keep Separate Example:** Cluster 1 covers a new trade agreement signed between Country X and Country Y. Cluster 2 covers protests *within* Country X about the economic impact of *that trade agreement*. While related, the signing event and the domestic protest are distinct stories/angles that could be analyzed separately. Cluster 3 covers a *different* trade dispute Country X has with Country Z – clearly a separate story.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your secondary goal is to identify clusters that should be **filtered out** before further processing. **Filtering should be used sparingly**, primarily to remove noise and maintain data quality, not to judge the importance of a story. The aim is to retain a record of all distinct, coherent events, even routine or smaller ones. Filter *only* if a cluster meets one of these specific criteria:\n",
    "*   **Very Low Article Count:** Contains **fewer than 3 articles**, indicating it likely doesn't represent a sufficiently developed or distinct event captured in the data.\n",
    "*   **Incoherent or Noise:** The articles within the cluster do not form a coherent topic, or the cluster appears to be noise/junk data.\n",
    "*   **Strict Duplicate:** The cluster covers the *exact same specific event* as another cluster, often with significant overlap in articles, making it redundant. (Do not filter merely *related* clusters).\n",

The sailors on the vessel, operated by UK-based Zodiac Maritime, noticed the fire at around midnight UTC on 3 June and were unable to stop the conflagration.\\nRight on the date line. Source: Zodiac Maritime\\n\"The vessel is loaded with around 3,000 vehicles, 800 of which are electric vehicles,\" Zodiac Marine told The Register. \"Smoke was initially seen emanating from a deck carrying electric vehicles.\"\\n\"The crew immediately initiated emergency firefighting procedures using the vessel’s onboard fire suppression systems. However, despite their efforts, the situation could not be brought under control.\"\\nThe crew made a distress call and boarded lifeboats. Nearby merchant vessels responded and rescued the mariners, the Coast Guard tells us. The ship is now likely to continue burning until specialized fire-fighting crews arrive and attempt to halt the blaze.\\nWater, water everywhere. And none of it useful\\nEveryone knows firefighters use water to douse fires, and that the liquid surrounds ships at. So why was this fire so hard to stop?\\nBecause water and electricity don\\'t mix, and salt water is an even better conductor than fresh water. When salt water covers a lithium battery, it can cause a short circuit that causes the battery cells to overheat in a sequence of rapid reactions, a process called thermal runaway that can cause the entire battery to burn.\\nThermal runaway can happen days after immersion, thanks to minerals left over as the battery dries out, and even if the battery is completely discharged.\\nHeat can make Li-Ion batteries explode. Or restore their capacity, say Chinese boffins\\nFrom pantyhose to power cells, nylon gives lithium batteries a leg up\\nNIST trains AI to hear the \\'oh crap\\' moment before batteries explode\\nStarlink was offered for free to those hit by Hurricane Helene. It is not entirely free\\nBattery fires are also notoriously difficult to extinguish after they\\'ve started, and tend to burn hotter and faster than other blazes. Sometimes they reignite after firefighters put them out. One fire marshal told CNBC in 2022 about a Tesla that burned so hot, it melted part of the road.\\nFirefighters in areas hit by hurricanes and flooding have some experience dealing with battery fires.\\nAs Hurricane Milton approached Florida last fall, Florida State Fire Marshal Jimmy Patronis warned electric cars and other battery-powered kit \" are ticking time bombs.”\\n\"In the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, we have seen nearly 50 fires caused by lithium-ion batteries with 11 of those fires being caused by EVs.\"\\nJapanese shipping line Mitsui O.S.K is suing Volkswagen and insurers after a 2022 fire aboard the car transporter Felicity Ace. The vessel, packed full of luxury cars, allegedly caught fire when a lithium battery in a Porsche shorted out and ignited.\\nWhile the Felicity Ace’s crew escaped to safety, authorities left the fire to burn itself out. Attempts to tow the vessel to port failed and it sank in the Atlantic, leading to the loss of nearly 4,000 vehicles.\\nThe operator of the Morning Midas hopes to avoid a similar outcome. \"We are working closely with emergency responders with a tug being deployed to support salvage and firefighting operations,\" Zodiac Maritime told us. \"Our priorities are to ensure the continued safety of the crew and protect the marine environment.\" ®\\n```\\n\\n## [Cargo Ship Carrying Electric Vehicles Burns Off Alaska](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/05/us/alaska-fire-ship-electric-vehicles.html) (#106466)\\n\\n> 2025-06-05 06:59:49+00:00\\n\\n```\\nAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe U.S. Coast Guard said it would allow the fire to burn because the cars’ lithium-ion batteries could explode. The ship’s crew escaped on a lifeboat.Smoke rising from the cargo vessel Morning Midas in the Pacific Ocean on Tuesday.Credit...U.S. Coast Guard, via Associated PressJune 5, 2025, 2:59 a.m. ETA fire on a cargo ship carrying electric vehicles that contain highly flammable lithium-ion batteries was burning off Alaska’s coast on Wednesday night, more than 24 hours after it broke out, the U.S. Coast Guard and the ship’s manager said.A deck carrying electric vehicles began smoking on Tuesday afternoon when the ship, the Morning Midas, was approximately 1,200 miles from Anchorage, according to its manager, Zodiac Maritime. The crew, unable to contain it, sent a distress alert 15 minutes later, the London-based shipping company said in a statement.All 22 crew members left the 600-foot ship on a lifeboat and were rescued by a nearby commercial vessel, the Coast Guard said in a statement.A spokeswoman for the Coast Guard said that it was allowing the fire to burn out and watching from a safe distance because of the risk that lithium-ion batteries in the cars could explode.The agency plans to investigate the cause of the fire, said the spokeswoman, Petty Officer First Class Shannon Kearney of the Coast Guard’s 17th District in Alaska. She said it was too soon to conclude that the fire started from the electric vehicles.Electric vehicles contain lithium-ion batteries that can overheat and cause fires that spread rapidly and produce toxic gases, making them difficult and dangerous to extinguish.The Morning Midas was carrying 3,000 cars, including 800 electric vehicles, and had been expected to arrive at Lázaro Cárdenas in Mexico on June 15, according to Zodiac.The ship left Yantai, China, on May 26, and stopped at Shanghai and Nansha, two major hubs for Chinese electric vehicle exports, before setting off across the Pacific, according to Maritime Optima, a shipping data provider based in Norway.Imports from China dominate the electric vehicle market in Latin America. More than 60 percent of electric vehicles sold in Mexico in 2023 and 2024 were from China, according to the International Energy Agency.The dangers of battery fires can be greater at sea, where saltwater could corrode the materials covering a battery and ignite a larger flame.In 2022, the Felicity Ace, a car carrier slightly larger than Morning Midas, sank in the Atlantic Ocean along with around 4,000 vehicles — including Bentleys and Porsches — after a fire onboard burned for nearly two weeks.Lithium-ion batteries also pose risks to air travel. In recent months, Southwest Airlines and several carriers in Asia have tightened in-flight restrictions on the use and transport of the batteries. The bans in Asia went into effect after a fire destroyed a passenger jet at an airport in South Korea in January.There is no definitive link between portable batteries and that fire, and an investigation is underway.Francesca Regalado is a Times reporter covering breaking news.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

Revenue lifted 15% to £1.2 billion.Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Matt Britzman said: “Keeping a presence in London makes sense, but it does little to sugarcoat the fact that yet another London-listed tech firm is looking across the Atlantic for better valuations - a story that’s becoming all too familiar.”\\n1 hour agoECB guidance in focus as another rate cut looms The European Central is today expected to deliver another quarter point cut in the cost of borrowing by taking its deposit rate down to 2%.The main focus is likely to be on guidance on what happens next, given that today’s latest move will take monetary policy into the middle of the neutral range.Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank, said: “The real question is how far below 2% is the ECB willing (and required) to take interest rates?“We may not get an answer just yet as the ECB will want to keep some optionality.“At the same time, the very uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical context will significantly widen the confidence intervals around the central bank\\'s updated projections.“That said, the direction of travel is clear at the moment and that is towards lower interest rates.”\\n1

Marlowe’s 2,800 staff and portfolio of 27,000 clients will boost its existing fire and security business and add new capabilities in water and air hygiene and asbestos services.The cash and shares offer, which has been backed by the Marlowe board, equates to 466p a share or a 26.5% premium to Marlowe’s AIM-listed closing share price.The deal was announced alongside annual results, which showed that FTSE 250-listed Mitie increased revenues by 13% to £5.1 billion after a 35% jump in its total order book to £15.4 billion.\\n2 hours agoDr Martens profits slide, unveils new strategyBootmaker Dr Martens today recorded a steep drop in annual profits but said it expects a return to growth in the current financial year.The surplus of £34.1 million on an adjusted basis compared with £97.2 million the year before but was ahead of City forecasts of £30.6 million.Chief executive Ije Nwokorie, who was appointed in January, also unveiled a strategy update.The former Apple Retail executive said the group had been too focused on boots, meaning it has failed to take full advantage of its shoes, sandals and leather goods offering.His ambition is to establish Dr. Martens as the world\\'s most-desired premium footwear brand.Nwokorie said: “We will give more people more reasons to buy more of our products, whether that’s our iconic boots and shoes, newer product families such as Zebzag

listing to the US in major blow for the City](https://www.standard.co.uk/business/fintech-wise-city-stock-market-listing-us-b1231357.html) (#104577)\\n\\n> 2025-06-05 07:28:13+00:00\\n\\n```\\nOne of Britain’s biggest fintech companies Wise is to switch its primary share listing from London to America in a huge blow for the City.The Shoreditch based money transfer giant said that after a review of its listing arrangements “we intend to transfer our primary listing from the equity shares (transition) category on the London Stock Exchange to a US stock exchange, and to maintain a secondary listing on the LSE.”This would allow Wise to “expand the pool of investors able to invest in Wise, in particular US domestic institutional and retail investors, the largest global constituent of investors, many of whom are currently unable to hold our shares.”The move would also increase trading liquidity and provide “a potential pathway to inclusion in major US indices, further enhancing liquidity and demand for Wise shares. “A further benefit would be an enhanced profile “among potential customers, including for Wise Platform 一 the US is home to over 4,000 banks, including several of the world\\'s largest.”However Wise insisted: “ Our confidence in UK talent and the tech ecosystem here remains undimmed. One-fifth of our employees are based in the UK and we plan to continue hiring and investing in our UK team to fuel our growth in the UK and abroad.”Nevertheless is an undeniable blow to the prestige of London as a global fintech centre.Wise was formerly known as TransferWise and became the largest tech listing in the UK when it was valued at almost £9 billion after its 2021 stock market debut. It is now valued at more than £11 billion. The listing was viewed as a symbolic win for the UK., as former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s government was looking to encourage more global tech companies to choose London as their IPO destination. Kristo Käärmann, Co-founder and CEO of Wise said: “We believe the addition of a primary US listing would help us accelerate our mission and bring substantial strategic and capital market benefits to Wise and our Owners. “These include helping us drive greater awareness of Wise in the US, the biggest market opportunity in the world for our products today, and enabling better access to the world\\'s deepest and most liquid capital market. “A dual listing would also enable us to continue serving our UK-based Owners effectively, as part of our ongoing commitment to the UK. The UK is home to some of the best talent in the world in financial services and technology, and we will continue to invest in our presence here to fuel our UK and global growth.\"\\n```\\n\\n## [Dr Martens sees profits slide but on track for return to growth](https://www.standard.co.uk/business/business-news/dr-martens-sees-profits-slide-but-on-track-for-return-to-growth-b1231355.html) (#104581)\\n\\n> 2025-06-05 07:14:00+00:00\\n\\n```\\nDr Martens has revealed annual profits slumped as sales came under pressure and it cautioned over ongoing falling revenues in the UK.The footwear group reported pre-tax profits of £8.8 million for the year to March 30, down from £93 million the previous year, after seeing sales fall 10%.On an underlying basis, pre-tax profits slumped to £34.1 million from £97.2 million.The group said sales to consumers in the US returned to growth in the second half of the year and have continued to increase, but revealed UK revenues have remained lower since the year-end “due to a challenging market”.It added that unfavourable foreign exchange rates would see it take a hit to group sales and profits of around £18 million and £3 million respectively in 2025-26.Despite this, Dr Martens said it expects underlying profits to rise “significantly” over the financial year ahead, with analysts expecting a jump to between £54 million and £74 million.It flagged uncertainty over the impact of higher tariffs, but said it was holding off from price hikes for the the remainder of 2025.Its stock is already in the US market for the spring/summer season and either there or on its way for the autumn/winter.“We do however recognise that there is continued macroeconomic uncertainty and the full outcome of tariffs is still unknown, and we will monitor this closely through the year and take action as appropriate,” the group said.The Northamptonshire-based company outlined new plans for growth alongside its results, with aims to attract new shoppers and hold off from discounts in EMEA and the Americas.Annual figures showed sales sales dropped 11.4% over the year, although retail lifted 1% in the final six months.In the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region, sales fell 11%, with direct-to-consumer difficulty amid a highly promotional market – particularly in the UK.The company, whose yellow-stitched boots have been a retro mainstay for decades, has been in the doldrums in recent years, with declining revenues exacerbated by the cost-of-living crisis.It listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2021, and has since issued a slew of profit warnings and replaced its chief executive.Many of Dr Martens’ recent problems have come from steep declines in sales in the US, but new chief executive Ije Nwokorie said the group had stabilised in the past year.He said: “Our single focus in 2024-25 was to bring stability back to Dr Martens.“We have achieved this by returning our direct-to-consumer channel in the Americas back to growth, resetting our marketing approach to focus relentlessly on our products, delivering cost savings and significantly strengthening our balance sheet.”Mr Nwokorie, previously the firm’s head of marketing before taking on the top job from Kenny Wilson on January 6, said: “I am laser-focused on day-to-day execution, managing costs and maintaining our operational discipline while we navigate the current macroeconomic uncertainties.”\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

He was later taken into custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and was being transported to a detention facility in Arizona, she said in an email to The Associated Press. The Trump administration said in court filings last month that it was working to bring him back after he was deported to Mexico, despite his fears of being harmed there, days after a federal judge ordered the administration to facilitate his return. The U.S. Department of Justice didn\\'t immediately respond to a request for comments and details from the AP. The man, who is gay, was protected from being returned to his home country under a U.S. immigration judge’s order at the time. But the U.S. put him on a bus and sent him to Mexico instead, a removal that U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy found likely “lacked any semblance of due process.”Mexico later returned him to Guatemala, where he was in hiding, according to court documents. In a court filing before his return, government lawyers said that a so-called significant public benefit parole packet had been approved. The designation allows people who aren’t eligible to enter the U.S. to do so temporarily, often for reasons related to law enforcement or legal proceedings.An earlier court proceeding had determined that the man risked persecution or torture if returned to Guatemala. But he also feared returning to Mexico, where he says he was raped and extorted while seeking asylum in the U.S., according to court documents.“As far as we know, it is the first time since January 20 that (Department of Homeland Security) has facilitated return following a district court order,” Realmuto said. The case is among a string of findings by federal courts against recent Trump administration deportations. Those have included other deportations to third countries and the erroneous deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an El Salvadoran man who had lived in Maryland for roughly 14 years.The U.S. Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return to the U.S. from a notorious Salvadoran prison, rejecting the White House’s claim that it couldn’t retrieve him after mistakenly deporting him. Both the White House and the El Salvadoran president have said they are powerless to return him.\\n```\\n\\n## [Trump Admin Returns Guatemalan Man After Admitting Deportation Error](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-admin-returns-guatemalan-man-ocg-after-admitting-deportation-error-2081208) (#106451)\\n\\n> 2025-06-05 07:40:20+00:00\\n\\n```\\nBy\\nSophie Grace Clark is a Live News reporter based in London, with a focus on crime stories.

The White House has entertained the idea of working with the Kremlin to supply Russian gas to Europe.The Bovanenkovo gas field on the Yamal peninsula of Russia, operated by Gazprom, is a main source of gas for exports to Europe.Credit...Maxim Shemetov/ReutersJune 5, 2025, 2:38 a.m. ETIn May, an American investor tried to sell top German economic officials on an audacious plan to buy a Russian undersea pipeline. Despite years of international friction over the pipeline, he proposed to eventually activate it and deliver natural gas to Germany.The investor, Stephen P. Lynch, had already made the pitch to the Trump administration, which he was betting would want U.S. control over a pivotal piece of energy infrastructure. Now the Germans wanted to hear for themselves about Mr. Lynch’s proposal to lead a takeover of the much-criticized pipeline on the floor of the Baltic Sea, called Nord Stream 2.The German officials were skeptical in their May 6 meeting in Berlin, Mr. Lynch recalls, asking him how he intended to persuade them to allow Russian gas to flow through the pipeline, which was partially sabotaged in 2022. That was not his job, Mr. Lynch says he answered, predicting that the Germans would persuade themselves eventually of the benefits of buying cheap Russian gas again.Amid the frantic geopolitical jockeying of recent months, touched off by Mr. Trump’s re-engaging with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, the future of Europe’s energy supply has emerged as a source of tension and vulnerability as the continent seeks to chart an independent course.Leaders in Berlin and Brussels have maneuvered in recent weeks to foreclose any possibility of new Russian gas imports, seeking a decisive break with the decades before Moscow’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, when Europe’s reliance on cheap Russian energy gave the Kremlin a powerful point of leverage. When President Trump meets with Germany’s new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, at the White House on Thursday, Mr. Merz will reiterate his opposition to using Nord Stream 2 if the issue comes up, Mr. Merz’s spokesman said this week.As Russia mobilized for war, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. vowed that, if Moscow invaded, “there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2,” and he imposed sanctions on the state-controlled company that owned it, while Germany refused to allow the newly completed pipeline to begin operation. After the invasion, European businesses and governments sharply reduced their dependence on Russian gas, trying to punish Moscow economically even though the effort came at considerable cost to themselves.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\\n```\\n\\n## [Friedrich Merz, Germany’s Chancellor, Heads to Meet Trump at White House](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/05/world/europe/merz-germany-trump-visit.html) (#103950)\\n\\n> 2025-06-05 05:44:10+00:00\\n\\n```\\nAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTYou have a preview view of this article while we are checking your access.

He aspires to be a steadying force and to make Germany indispensable to Europe’s effort to stand on its own feet.But first, he and his aides know, Mr. Merz will have to get past an on-camera Oval Office performance with President Trump. The president and his administration have shown a special animus toward Germany among the European nations Mr. Trump sees more as competitors than allies.Mr. Merz, a center-right politician and wealthy former lawyer, hopes that he and the president will speak the same language. He has spent much of his first month on the job rehearsing for the test, mindful of the dressings-down some other foreign leaders have received in the Oval, including President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa.Late on Wednesday, Trump officials threw him a curveball: They moved the Oval meeting to the start of the visit, before a working lunch. German officials had expected the lunch to come first, offering the leaders a chance to hash through any disagreements in private before the cameras rolled.The Merz team knows how important the first meeting between the leaders is. Mr. Merz’s aides, who briefed reporters in advance of the visit, have spoken with advisers of other leaders who made the pilgrimage to Washington to ask about their experiences. Mr. Merz has spoken with many of those leaders himself, including a recent call with Mr. Ramaphosa.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

He also accused Iran of \"slow walking\" talks and urged urgency.Newsweek has reached out to the White House as well as the Kremlin and Iran\\'s foreign ministry for comment.Why It MattersAn offer from Putin to join the nuclear negotiations would coincide with a growing strategic alliance between Russia and Iran, both of which seek to counter Western power.Russia\\'s entrance into the nuclear talks could add pressure to Iran, but it could also shift the diplomatic balance away from Washington\\'s preferred framework. It also marks a moment where Moscow, despite its war in Ukraine and increasing isolation from the West, asserts its role in shaping high-stakes global security issues.\\nPresident Donald Trump, right, shakes hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, during a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan, June 28, 2019.\\nSusan Walsh/AP Photo\\nWhat to KnowAccording to Trump, Putin said he would be willing to join discussions and \"could, perhaps, be helpful\" in pushing Iran toward a final nuclear agreement. While Russia was previously a party to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)—a multilateral agreement that placed limits on Iran\\'s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief—it has taken a backseat amid shifting diplomatic dynamics and the U.S. withdrawal under Trump\\'s prior administration.After the call, Putin aide Yury Ushakov confirmed Trump\\'s account, saying the U.S. president believed \"Russia\\'s assistance may be necessary\" and would welcome Moscow working with the Iranian side.\\nMoscow and Tehran TiesEarlier this year, Russia and Iran signed a 20-year strategic partnership agreement, formalizing cooperation across military, economic, and technological sectors.The treaty, ratified by both nations\\' parliaments, includes provisions for joint military exercises, intelligence sharing, and collaboration on energy projects. This deepening alliance reflects a shared intent to counter Western influence and navigate around sanctions, which they both face.U.S.-Iran TalksSo far, negotiations between Washington and Tehran have failed to produce a new agreement. The U.S. wants Iran to halt uranium enrichment to prevent it building nuclear weapons, while Iran says its program is for peaceful, civilian energy purposes. No breakthrough has been reached, and prospects have dimmed further after Iran\\'s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday that the latest U.S. proposal contradicts Iran\\'s national interests.\\nIn this picture released by an official website of the office of the Iranian supreme leader, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, right, speaks with Russia\\'s President Vladimir Putin, in Tehran, Iran, Friday, Sept. 7, 2018....\\nOffice of the Iranian Supreme Leader/AP photo\\nWhat People Are SayingPresident Donald Trump: \"President Putin suggested that he will participate in the discussions with Iran and that he could, perhaps, be helpful in getting this brought to a rapid conclusion.\"Yury Ushakov, aide to President Putin: \"Donald Trump believes that Russia\\'s assistance may be necessary here, and he would appreciate it if Russia could work with the Iranian side accordingly.\"Negar Mortazavi, senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, editor and host of The Iran Podcast told Newsweek: \"President Trump\\'s suggestion that Putin could assist in the Iran talks signals a continued interest in striking a nuclear deal. Putin may indeed be in a position to help, given his leverage with both Washington and Tehran.\"What Happens NextWith Russia signaling a new role in nuclear diplomacy and Iran holding firm on its enrichment program, the coming weeks may see increased trilateral engagement — though it is unclear whether Putin\\'s involvement would hastens an agreement or reinforce Iran\\'s determination.\\nIs This Article Trustworthy?\\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fairWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.Newsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fairWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.Slide Circle to VoteReader Avg.No\\nModerately\\nYes VOTE About the writer\\nAmir Daftari is a Newsweek reporter based in London, specializing in global affairs with a focus on the Middle East.

German officials say the two leaders have started to build a “decent” relationship, with Merz wanting to avoid the antagonism that defined Trump\\'s relationship with one of his predecessors, Angela Merkel, in Trump\\'s first term. The 69-year-old Merz is a conservative former rival of Merkel\\'s who took over her party after she retired from politics. Merz also comes to office with an extensive business background — something that could align him with Trump.A White House official said topics that Trump is likely to raise with Merz include Germany’s defense spending, trade, Ukraine and what the official called “democratic backsliding,\" saying the administration\\'s view is that shared values such as freedom of speech have deteriorated in Germany and the country should reverse course. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the discussions.Merz will want to avoid an Oval Office showdown of the kind that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa experienced in recent months. Asked about the risk of a White House blow-up, Merz spokesperson Stefan Kornelius said on Monday that the chancellor is “well-prepared” for the meeting and that he and Trump have “built up a decent relationship, at least by phone\" and via text messaging. Merz has thrown himself into diplomacy on Ukraine, traveling to Kyiv with fellow European leaders days after taking office and receiving Zelenskyy in Berlin last week. He has thanked Trump for his support for an unconditional ceasefire while rejecting the idea of “dictated peace” or the “subjugation” of Ukraine and advocating for more sanctions against Russia.The White House official said Trump on Thursday will stress that direct peace talks must continue. In their first phone call since Merz became chancellor, Trump said he would support the efforts of Germany and other European countries to achieve peace, according to a readout from the German government. Merz also said last month that “it is of paramount importance that the political West not let itself be divided, so I will continue to make every effort to produce the greatest possible unity between the European and American partners.”Under Merz\\'s immediate predecessor, Olaf Scholz, Germany became the second-biggest supplier of military aid to Ukraine after the United States. Merz has vowed to keep up the support and last week pledged to help Ukraine develop its own long-range missile systems that would be free of any range limits.At home, Merz\\'s government is intensifying a drive that Scholz started to bolster the German military after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In Trump\\'s first term, Berlin was a target of his ire for failing to meet the current NATO target of spending 2% of gross domestic product on defense, and Trump is now demanding at least 5% from allies. The White House official said the upcoming NATO summit in the Netherlands later this month is a “good opportunity” for Germany to commit to meeting that 5% mark. Scholz set up a 100 billion euro ($115 billion) special fund to modernize Germany\\'s armed forces — called the Bundeswehr — which had suffered from years of neglect. Germany has met the 2% target thanks to the fund, but it will be used up in 2027.Merz has said that “the government will in the future provide all the financing the Bundeswehr needs to become the strongest conventional army in Europe.” He has endorsed a plan for all allies to aim to spend 3.5% of GDP on their defense budgets by 2032, plus an extra 1.5% on potentially defense-related things like infrastructure.Another top priority for Merz is to get Germany\\'s economy, Europe\\'s biggest, moving again after it shrank the past two years. He wants to make it a “locomotive of growth,” but Trump\\'s tariff threats are a potential obstacle for a country whose exports have been a key strength. At present, the economy is forecast to stagnate in 2025.Germany exported $160 billion worth of goods to the U.S. last year, according to the Census Bureau. That was about $85 billion more than what the U.S. sent to Germany, a trade deficit that Trump wants to erase.The U.S. president has specifically gone after the German auto sector, which includes major brands such as Audi, BMW, Mercedes Benz, Porsche and Volkswagen. Americans bought $36 billion worth of cars, trucks and auto parts from Germany last year, while the Germans purchased $10.2 billion worth of vehicles and parts from the U.S.Trump’s 25% tariff on autos and parts is specifically designed to increase the cost of German-made automobiles in hopes of causing them to move their factories to the U.S., even though many of the companies already have plants in the U.S. with Volkswagen in Tennessee, BMW in South Carolina and Mercedes-Benz in Alabama and South Carolina.There’s only so much Merz can achieve on his view that tariffs “benefit no one and damage everyone” while in Washington, as trade negotiations are a matter for the European Union’s executive commission. Trump recently delayed a planned 50% tariff on goods coming from the European Union, which would have otherwise gone into effect this month. One source of strain in recent months is a speech Vice President JD Vance gave in Munich shortly before Germany\\'s election in February, in which he lectured European leaders about the state of democracy on the continent and said there is no place for “firewalls.” That term is frequently used to describe mainstream German parties\\' refusal to work with the far-right Alternative for Germany, which finished second in the election and is now the biggest opposition party.Merz criticized the comments. He told ARD television last month that it isn\\'t the place of a U.S. vice president “to say something like that to us in Germany; I wouldn\\'t do it in America, either.”___Moulson reported from Berlin.

Trump frequently uses Biden as a political foil and has sought to undo a number of policies from his predecessor\\'s administration since he returned to office. The announcement Wednesday directs the White House counsel and Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate whether anyone \"conspired to deceive the public about Biden\\'s mental state and unconstitutionally exercise the authorities and responsibilities of the President.\" It is an escalation of an issue that Trump and his allies have frequently raised, possibly paving the way for Republicans to argue that many of Biden’s actions as president were invalid.\"This conspiracy marks one of the most dangerous and concerning scandals in American history,\" Trump wrote in a memo. \"The American public was purposefully shielded from discovering who wielded the executive power, all while Biden’s signature was deployed across thousands of documents to effect radical policy shifts.\"Trump has acknowledged using the autopen himself in office. In March, he said he turned to it “only for very unimportant papers,” such as responses to letters.“But to use them for — for what they’ve used them for is terrible,” he added, referring to the Biden administration. In Wednesday\\'s memo, Trump further contended that if Biden’s aides “secretly” used the pen to conceal his alleged decline while they were taking executive actions in his stead, “that would constitute an unconstitutional wielding of the power of the Presidency, a circumstance that would have implications for the legality and validity of numerous executive actions undertaken in Biden’s name.”Biden defended his record in a statement Wednesday, arguing that the probe was a “distraction” from Trump and Republican lawmakers.“Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn’t is ridiculous and false,” Biden said. Trump has previously claimed without evidence that Biden used an autopen to sign pre-emptive pardons for the members of Congress who investigated the events surrounding the Jan. 6, 2021, attack at the U.S. Capitol, rendering them “void.”Autopens have long been a mechanical tool to reproduce signatures in the White House, with Barack Obama being the first president to use it to sign legislation, according to The Associated Press. Previous administrations have pointed to a 2005 Office of Legal Counsel memo stating that the president “need not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill he approves and decides to sign in order for the bill to become law.” Biden has frequently defended himself against claims about his mental fitness and memory.Former special counsel Robert Hur said in a report last year that Biden would probably present to a jury as a \"sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory\" in explaining his decision not to prosecute Biden after an investigation of his handling of classified documents.Biden rejected Hur\\'s claims about his memory shortly after the report was released last year, saying, \"My memory’s fine.\"In an interview with ABC’s “The View” in May, Biden again denied having suffered from mental decline when he was president.“They are wrong,” he said of the allegations.House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., is also investigating Biden and has asked several former White House aides to appear for transcribed interviews.Elyse Perlmutter-GumbinerElyse Perlmutter-Gumbiner is the coordinating producer for the NBC News White House unit.Zoë RichardsZoë Richards is a politics reporter for NBC News.Kelly O\\'Donnell contributed.\\n```\\n\\n## [Trump orders Attorney General to investigate Biden\\'s autopen use amid cognitive decline concerns](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-orders-attorney-general-investigate-bidens-autopen-use-amid-cognitive-decline-concerns) (#104725)\\n\\n> 2025-06-05 04:36:04+00:00\\n\\n```\\nJoin Fox News for access to this content You have reached your maximum number of articles.

Not only can the signature turn words into laws of the land, but it also appoints individuals to some of the highest positions in government, creates or eliminates national policies and allows prisoners to go free.\"In recent months, it has become increasingly apparent that former President Biden\\'s aides abused the power of Presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden\\'s cognitive decline and assert Article II authority,\" Trump wrote. \"This conspiracy marks one of the most dangerous and concerning scandals in American history. The American public was purposefully shielded from discovering who wielded the executive power, all while Biden\\'s signature was deployed across thousands of documents to effect radical policy shifts.\"He continued, saying Biden had suffered from \"serious cognitive decline\" for years, and the Department of Justice (DOJ) recently concluded that Biden should not stand trial, despite clear evidence he broke the law, because of his mental state.EXCLUSIVE: COMER HAILS DOJ\\'S BIDEN PROBE AS HOUSE INVESTIGATION HEATS UP President Trump called on Attorney General Pam Bondi to launch an investigation into whether former President Biden\\'s team used an autopen and covered up the former president\\'s cognitive decline. (Trump: Reuters / Autopen: AP)\"Biden\\'s cognitive issues and apparent mental decline during his presidency were even ‘worse’ in private, and those closest to him ‘tried to hide it’ from the public,\" Trump said. \"To do so, Biden\\'s advisors during his years in office severely restricted his news conferences and media appearances, and they scripted his conversations with lawmakers, government officials, and donors, all to cover up his inability to discharge his duties.\"Still, during the Biden presidency, the White House issued over 1,200 Presidential documents, appointed 235 judges to the federal bench and issued more pardons and commutations than any administration in U.S. history, Trump said.The president wrote about Biden’s decision just two days before Christmas 2024, to commute the sentences of 37 of the 40 most dangerous criminals on federal death row, including mass murderers and child killers.TRUMP SAYS BIDEN DIDN\\'T FAVOR HIS ADMIN\\'S LAX BORDER SECURITY POLICY, SUGGESTS AUTOPEN PLAYED A ROLE A new book describes President Joe Biden\\'s cabinet meetings as \"scripted\" and \"uncomfortable.\"\\xa0 (Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Care Can\\'t Wait Action)\"Although the authority to take these executive actions, along with many others, is constitutionally committed to the President, there are serious doubts as to the decision-making process and even the degree of Biden\\'s awareness of these actions being taken in his name,\" Trump wrote. \"The vast majority of Biden\\'s executive actions were signed using a mechanical signature pen, often called an autopen, as opposed to Biden\\'s own hand. This was especially true of actions taken during the second half of his Presidency, when his cognitive decline had apparently become even more clear to those working most closely with him.\"Given clear indications that President Biden lacked the capacity to exercise his Presidential authority, if his advisors secretly used the mechanical signature pen to conceal this incapacity, while taking radical executive actions all in his name, that would constitute an unconstitutional wielding of the power of the Presidency, a circumstance that would have implications for the legality and validity of numerous executive actions undertaken in Biden\\'s name,\" he added.TRUMP HAS NOT DIRECTED ADMIN TO DECLASSIFY BIDEN DOCS ON HEALTH \\'COVER-UP\\' President-elect Donald Trump shakes hands with U.S. President Joe Biden at Trump\\'s inauguration in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda on January 20, 2025 in Washington, DC (Kenny Holston-Pool/Getty Images)The memo goes on to call for an investigation that addresses if certain individuals, who are not named in the document, conspired to deceive the American public about the former president’s mental state and \"unconstitutionally\" exercised the president’s authority and responsibilities.Specifically, Trump called on the attorney general’s investigation to look at any activity that purposefully shielded the public from information about Biden’s mental and physical health; any agreements between his aides to falsely deem recorded videos of Biden’s cognitive ability as fake; and any agreements between Biden’s aides to require false, public statements that elevated the president’s capabilities.The investigation will also look at which policy documents the autopen was used for, including clemency grants, executive orders, and presidential memoranda, as well as who directed Biden’s signature to be affixed to those documents.Trump said last week that he thinks Biden did not really agree with many of his administration’s lax border security policies, instead suggesting that those surrounding the former president took advantage of his declining faculties and utilized the autopen to pass radical directives pertaining to the border.House Republicans, led by Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, launched an investigation earlier last month aimed at determining whether Biden, who was in declining health during the final months of his presidency, was mentally fit to authorize the use of the autopen.

While in office, Biden and his aides dismissed concerns abut his mental acuity, but he ultimately stepped aside as the Democratic presidential candidate after a disastrous debate against Trump in June last year magnified concerns. He was replaced as the Democratic nominee by former Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost the election to Trump.Last month, Biden\\'s office announced the former president had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer.Trump wished Biden well after the cancer diagnosis, but has continued to criticize his predecessor and share baseless conspiracy theories about him.\\nWhat People Are Saying Trump wrote in the memo: \"In recent months, it has become increasingly apparent that former President Biden\\'s aides abused the power of Presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden\\'s cognitive decline.\"This conspiracy marks one of the most dangerous and concerning scandals in American history. The American public was purposefully shielded from discovering who wielded the executive power, all while Biden\\'s signature was deployed across thousands of documents to effect radical policy shifts.\"House Oversight Chairman James Comer, a Republican who has requested transcribed interviews with Biden\\'s aides and White House physician, said in a statement on Wednesday: \"The American people deserve full transparency and the House Oversight Committee is conducting a thorough investigation to provide answers and accountability. The cover-up of President Biden\\'s mental decline is one of the greatest scandals in our nation\\'s history.\"Comer added that the five former senior advisors \"were eyewitnesses to President Biden\\'s condition and operations within the Biden White House. They must appear before the House Oversight Committee and provide truthful answers about President Biden\\'s cognitive state and who was calling the shots.\"Representative Dan Goldman, a New York Democrat, said on CNN: \"The bottom line is, this is also a distraction. The idea of focusing on President Biden is a way of distracting from Donald Trump\\'s efforts to completely undermine our democracy, to grift and engage in corruption and to help out his billionaire buddies by cutting their taxes while taking Medicaid away from the American people.\"Joe Biden is not president, Donald Trump is president. And the Oversight Committee and Chairman Comer and the House Republicans generally are doing nothing to rein in Donald Trump\\'s lawlessness, and instead, we\\'re focusing on Joe Biden, who\\'s no longer president.\"What\\'s NextIt remains unclear how far Trump will push the effort to investigate Biden, which could face legal challenges.\\n```\\n\\n## [Comer Goes After Biden\\'s Doctor as Trump Orders Investigation Into Biden Decline/Autopen Scandal](https://redstate.com/nick-arama/2025/06/04/trump-orders-investigation-into-biden-decline-scandal-n2190059) (#106567)\\n\\n> 2025-06-05 01:29:00+00:00\\n\\n```\\nThe House is looking into the Biden cognitive decline scandal and has called for multiple Biden aides, in addition to Joe Biden\\'s physician, to come in for transcribed testimony.\\nOn Wednesday, Comer also said that he will be issuing a subpoena for Dr. Kevin O\\'Connor.

Legal expert weighs in\\n05:51\\nPresident Trump ordered an investigation Wednesday into whether former President Joe Biden\\'s administration used an autopen machine to sign key presidential documents like pardons — months after Mr. Trump claimed his predecessor\\'s pardons were illegitimate.In a memo signed Wednesday night, Mr. Trump told Attorney General Pam Bondi and the president\\'s counsel to probe what he claimed was a \"conspiracy\" to \"abuse the power of Presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden\\'s cognitive decline.\"\\nThe order cited a litany of executive actions by Biden — including pardons and federal judge appointments — and argued \"there are serious doubts as to the decision making process and even the degree of Biden\\'s awareness of these actions being taken in his name.\"\\xa0It then suggested that if Biden\\'s advisers \"secretly used the mechanical signature pen,\" it would \"have implications for the legality and validity of numerous executive actions.\"Mr. Trump said the investigation should cover whether Biden\\'s aides \"conspired to deceive the public about Biden\\'s mental state and unconstitutionally exercise the authorities and responsibilities of the president.\" It also directed an investigation into which executive actions an autopen was used for, and who directed its use.In a statement, Biden called the attacks false and \"nothing more than a distraction by Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans.\"\"Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn\\'t is ridiculous and false,\" Biden said.Presidents have used an autopen — or a signature-signing machine — to sign certain documents for decades, and then-President George W. Bush\\'s Justice Department said in 2005 that the president can legally use an autopen to sign bills into law. Mr. Trump said in March he has occasionally used an autopen, but \"only for very unimportant papers.\"\\nBut Mr. Trump and his allies have suggested Biden\\'s alleged use of an autopen could be illegitimate. In March, the president claimed a slate of pardons issued to some Trump foes in the final days of his administration were \"VOID\" and \"VACANT.\"CBS News legal contributor Jessica Levinson said in March that Mr. Trump cannot revoke his predecessor\\'s pardons, even if an autopen was involved, noting that the president\\'s constitutional power to pardon people is extremely broad. \"This is not a gray area,\" she said on \"CBS Mornings Plus.\"Early Wednesday, Mr. Trump on Truth Social\\xa0called the alleged autopen use \"THE BIGGEST POLITICAL SCANDAL IN AMERICAN HISTORY,\" aside from the 2020 presidential election, which Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed — without evidence — was rigged.Scrutiny over Biden\\'s mental acuity while in office has ramped up in recent weeks, amid new reporting about the circumstances of Biden\\'s exit from the 2024 presidential race. Earlier Wednesday, the Republican chair of the House Oversight Committee, Rep. James Comer of Kentucky,\\xa0pushed several members of Biden\\'s inner circle to answer questions about the president\\'s \"mental and physical faculties\" while serving as the chief executive.\\nJoe Biden\\nDonald Trump\\nTrump Administration\\nJoe Walsh\\nJoe Walsh is a senior editor for digital politics at CBS News.

Of these, six to 10 are forecast to become hurricanes with winds of 74 miles per hour (mph) or higher, including three to five major hurricanes with winds of 111mph or higher.\\nHurricane Beryl, a Category 4 storm, pummelled Jamaica in early July last year, causing extensive damage to properties and infrastructure, especially in the southwestern section of the island.\\nIt damaged crops, lifted roofs, and left hundreds of citizens without power for weeks.\\nSpeaking at a National Disaster Risk Management Council (NDRMC) meeting yesterday, Holness highlighted the impact of Hurricane Beryl and stated that it is imperative that the country further strengthen its institutions to mitigate the effect of any future storms.\\n“Our approach includes strengthening national institutions and legislations; investing in science, technology and early warning systems; building capacity at community level; aligning the national framework with climate resilience; and ensuring that disaster risk reduction is cross-cutting – touching education, housing, health, infrastructure, energy and the environment,” he said.\\nRESILIENT UTILITIES\\nHe emphasised the importance of improving the resilience of the country’s utilities, and noted that the Jamaica Public Service Company had already started a comprehensive review of its distribution network to replace broken or damaged poles.\\nHe stated that this work should be ongoing throughout the year and be done “with great speed and alacrity”.\\nThe Government has also commenced work to provide an independent source of energy for key National Water Commission pumping stations, in the event of power outage during a hurricane, Holness disclosed.\\nHe noted that the long-term plan is to ensure that those pumping stations that are critical areas for supply and distribution have backup generators or are powered by solar energy.\\nThe damage caused to roofs underscored the need for hurricane straps, Holness contended. To this end, he said the municipalities have some work to do.\\n“The parish councils (municipal corporations), the approval entities and the Ministry of Local Government, through a national public campaign, must reinforce the building codes as it relates to roofs, and the need to build according to code, and use in particular hurricane straps to secure roofs,” he said.\\nMinister of Local Government Desmond McKenzie declared that the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM) would continue the distribution of hurricane straps this year.\\n“The ODPEM initiated, last year, a hurricane strap programme, and we are expecting this year to do the same by providing, through the municipal corporations, a couple thousand hurricane straps,” he said.\\nMcKenzie added: “As we prepare for this hurricane season, more than 900 shelters are being inspected and are ready.”\\nHolness also stated that the Government has been investing in the expansion of early warning systems, and collaborating with other regional entities. He shared that, with the help of the Japanese government, Jamaica now has a robust national disaster emergency telecommunication system and public safety network.\\n“These allow us to disseminate real-time alerts, mobilise response teams, and reach even our most remote communities in times of crisis,” he said.\\nAnd although he lauded the recovery of farmers from the impact of Hurricane Beryl, Holness, who chairs the NDRMC, acknowledged that the Government must strengthen its support, especially for those who utilise greenhouses.\\nHe also stressed the need for greater investment in coastal protection, as the threat of sea level rising intensifies.\\nCENTRALISED DATABASE\\nHe added that there was a need for a centralised database of citizens affected by the disaster, to prevent the duplication of aid distribution.\\nHolness outlined proactive steps taken by the Government to fortify Jamaica’s ability to respond to and recover from disasters. These include establishing a disaster recovery fund and a contingency fund.\\nThe Government is also participating in, and has embarked on, other initiatives, such as the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility and the Catastrophe Bond.\\nMinister of Finance and the Public Service Fayval Williams noted that this National Natural Disaster Risk Financing Policy, which ensures financial flexibility to meet natural disasters, now stands at approximately $130.6 billion. The amount the Government can access will depend on the severity of the disaster, she said.\\n“An advantage of the catastrophe coverage we have in place is that it is parametric, meaning there are predefined thresholds, and predefined payouts,” she said.\\nThe prime minister, in the meantime, urged citizens to safeguard their identification documents, so that in the event of a hurricane, they would be able to access aid.\\n“Preparedness is not just being able to conduct humanitarian exercises when a disaster hits. You have to now be prepared to deal with the energy crisis that could come, the trade crisis that could come, the impact on the economy in terms of inflation when goods get scarce, the citizen safety and security issues that could happen; all elements of any consideration as to the stability of the society.”\\nsashana.small@gleanerjm.com\\n```\\n\\n## [Time to prepare: Hurricane season has officially started](https://naturaldisasters.einnews.com/article/819226767/CCbd473tFCqzYoKU?ref=rss&ecode=5DCHg6ojdayQpKlr) (#105134)\\n\\n> 2025-06-05 05:21:56+00:00\\n\\n```\\nTYLER, Texas (KLTV) - Hurricane season has officially started. Even if you’re not on the coast, heavy rain and storms can still impact your area.“Now is the time to prepare,” says Andrew Tate, First Alert Meteorologist.Tate says areas closer to the Gulf Coast are at higher risk for hurricanes, but even inland areas can be severely affected.“You can see those impacts further inland and sometimes that all has to do with the track of a system, and if you’re on ‘the dirty side’, which is usually that eastern side of the storm,” says TateHurricane Beryl from 2024 showed how unpredictable the season can be, rapidly intensifying and impacting East Texas.“Just because we saw Beryl in East Texas last summer doesn’t mean that we’re exempt this year,” says Tate. “But at the same time, that doesn’t mean that we will see something like Beryl, it is just each year it’s an independent variable on whether or not you would see a strong system.”Ryan Knapp from National Weather Service forecast office in Shreveport spoke on East Texas Now regarding some of the main concerns during hurricane season, especially those living inland.NWS meteorologist Ryan Knapp gives insight into upcoming Atlantic hurricane season“If you do live farther inland, you can still see tornadoes, you can see damaging winds, you can see flooding rainfall and just understand that that risk still exists for landfalling storms, especially if they’re stronger when they make landfall,” says Knapp.That’s why Knapp says the key is to prepare early.“You know, just being prepared, having a preparedness kit, you know, like I said, hurricane season started just over the weekend,” says Knapp. “So you know, obviously we haven’t seen anything developed yet, but it’s good to start, really, in the event that we do run into a situation where there’s a storm on the way.”You can stay ahead of hurricane season and any severe weather threat by downloading our weather apps.For more information on how to download the KLTV weather app on your phone, click here.For more information on how to download the KTRE weather app on your phone,\\xa0click here.Copyright 2025 KLTV.

The Colorado State University team is predicting 17 named storms.Article continues belowJohn Morales, delivered a somber message during his routine broadcast on NBC 6 South Florida. With the image of an impending hurricane as his backdrop, he expressed his uncertainty about continuing his vital weather predictions due to severe budget cuts.Article continues belowMorales, visibly disheartened, criticized the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and the Trump administration for their sweeping reductions in funding at both the National Weather Service (NWS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).READ MORE: Liam Neeson opened up about friends who died on hunger strike during the TroublesREAD MORE: Sisters, 9, 8 and 5, found dead on planned father visitation had zip-tied bags over headsJohn Morales highlighted the impact of the cuts (Image: NBC6/Youtube)Predicting hurricanes just got harderMorales lamented, \"And I am here to tell you that I am not sure that I can do that this year because of the cuts, the gutting, the sledgehammer attack on science in general,\" referring to his distinguished history of accurately forecasting hurricanes in a region frequently hit by them.\\u200cHighlighting his expertise, Morales recalled his accurate prediction of Hurricane Dorian\\'s trajectory in 2019, which was less destructive to Florida than anticipated—a testament to his 34 years of critical weather reporting in South Florida.In a YouTube video preceding his broadcast, Morales underscored the gravity of the situation. The Trump administration, following DOGE\\'s advice, had enacted significant budgetary slashesThese financial constraints resulted in drastic staff reductions and cutbacks in essential resources, such as a 20% decrease in weather balloon launches, compromising the ability to provide life-saving weather updates.\\u200cThis comes after, acting Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Director David Richardson professed ignorance about the U.S. having an annual hurricane season.Morales expressed concern over the cuts, stating they have \"a multigenerational impact on science in this country\" and will make his job significantly more challenging.Where the cuts have hitHe revealed that the Central and South Florida NWS offices were understaffed by 19 to 39%, and budget cuts to NOAA\\'s Hurricane Hunter flight program could ground the aircraft this week.\\u200cAccording to Morales, these cuts are degrading the quality of weather forecasts, leaving meteorologists \"flying blind\" and unable to predict a hurricane\\'s strength before it makes landfall, which could be fatal.When is hurricane season?Although the season runs yearly from June 1 to Novemver 30 but this isn\\'t the peak time.Historically, the most active time for hurricane development is mid-August through mid-October.\\u200cCould lead to \\'needless loss of life\\'The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts 13 to 19 named storms, six to 10 hurricanes and three to five major hurricanes.In an NBC 6 column, the meteorologist warned that the combination of an expected active hurricane season and budget cuts leaves meteorologists without sufficient data for accurate forecasts.This situation could create a \"combustible mix\" and result in \"needless loss of life\" if a severe storm hits - as they wouldn\\'t be able to warn people in time.Article continues belowTrump has overseen deep cuts to many services (Image: Getty Images)\"Am I worried?\" he wrote. \"You bet I am!\" While he didn\\'t mention Trump by name, he did point out the staff and resource cuts that have been happening since the start of the president\\'s second term.“Everyone is focused on ‘below average, average, above average,’” said Mary Blakeney, director of the Palm Beach County Public Safety Department’s Division of Emergency Management. “Tell people it doesn’t matter if it’s one hurricane. If it impacts you, it could be catastrophic.”\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

With a brand new Mario Kart game to enjoy and countless other titles in the Switch\\'s extensive back-catalogue, it\\'s set to be an exciting weekend ahead for many gamers.While the Nintendo Switch 2 console is of course the main event, you can enhance your experience by picking up a few accessories alongside your new gadget. Some will make gaming in docked mode much more pleasurable, while others will help to keep your £400 console safe during its lifetime.I\\'ve rounded up some of the best accessories you can purchase for the Nintendo Switch 2 right now, along with the best prices. Find all the details below:Nintendo Switch 2 Carrying Case & Screen Protector - £20.99Nintendo Switch 2 Carrying Case & Screen Protector - £20.99(Image: Nintendo)The Nintendo Switch 2 is a hybrid console, meaning it can either be played docked to a TV or portably in handheld mode. Despite handheld mode being a tentpole of the Switch 2\\'s design, Nintendo doesn\\'t actually supply you with a carry case by default.That means if you want to take the Switch 2 out and about, you run the risk of it getting damaged by just throwing it in a bag and hoping for the best. To ensure your brand new console stays safe, it\\'s worth investing in a carry case and screen protector.Nintendo sells an official carrying case on its site, which also comes with a screen protector for good measure. It\\'s simple in its design with a blacked out colour scheme aside from some blue and red accents on the zips.There\\'s also room to carry up to six game cartridges in the case at the same time, letting you bring up to seven games on the go with you if you count one installed in the system itself. Best of all, it doesn\\'t really break the bank coming in at £20.99 from the official Nintendo Store.Click here to add the Nintendo Switch 2 Carrying Case & Screen Protector to your basket.Nintendo Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip - £29.95Nintendo Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip - £29.95(Image: Amazon)You can get away with using the set of Joy-Cons that the Nintendo Switch 2 comes with, especially since the console comes with a grip to insert them into to turn them into a more traditional controller. However, that included grip is missing one hugely important feature - it doesn\\'t let you charge the Joy-Cons while in use.This is especially disappointing if you\\'re someone who enjoys longer gaming sessions as running out of charge means you\\'ll need to dock them directly onto the console. You can get around this issue by picking up this Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip, which lets you plug in a USB C cable to provide power to the Joy-Cons while without interrupting a gaming session.What\\'s more, this grip adds an additional two back grip buttons to the controllers which can be mapped to any other button you like. This will be especially useful for those who enjoy competitive games, or who particularly hate having to take their thumbs off the sticks to press certain buttons.Click here to add the Nintendo Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip to your basket.Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller - £74.95Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller - £74.95(Image: Amazon)For players who intend to play their Nintendo Switch 2 almost entirely in docked mode, it\\'s worth picking up the new Pro Controller that\\'s releasing alongside the new console. It adds those additional back paddle buttons while providing a more traditional controller layout and grip.It also comes equipped with an audio jack at the bottom which lets you plug in headphones to the controller and listen to your game without disturbing those around you. An NFC connection is located in here too, letting you scan Amiibo for unique in-game rewards.Click here to add the Nintendo Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip to your basket.Nintendo Switch 2 Camera - £49Nintendo Switch 2 Camera - £49(Image: Amazon)The Nintendo Switch 2 Camera is a brand new addition for this console, allowing you to show your face to friends while playing games online. This functionality is now baked into the consoles software, with it using clever trickery to cut your face out from the background and layer it over in-game elements, like your kart in Mario Kart or games in Super Mario Party.It\\'s certainly a unique use of the gadget and will mostly benefit those who enjoy playing their Switch 2 online. If this sounds like your cup of tea though, it can be picked up for £49.99.Click here to add the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera to your basket. There\\'s also an adorable Piranha Plant version, although this has a lower camera resolution.ProCase 2 Pack Joy-Con Controller Hand Grips - £13.58ProCase 2 Pack Joy-Con Controller Hand Grips - £13.58(Image: Amazon)While you can use the Joy-Con 2 controllers individually, they are a little on the small side and cause hand cramp if used in this way for a long period of time. If you\\'re someone who\\'s likely to be playing a lot of two-player Mario Kart, it might be worth picking up some of these grips to make the experience a little more pleasurable.The Joy-Cons slot into the grips seamlessly, creating a much larger grip for you to hold that\\'s far more ergonomic in the hand. What\\'s more, it adds some much more substantial trigger buttons that make it much easier to feel when you\\'re pressing them.At £13.58, it\\'s one of the cheaper ways to enhance your Nintendo Switch 2 experience from day one. Click here to add the ProCase 2 Pack Joy-Con Controller Hand Grips to your basket.JSAUX 2-Pack Anti-Glare Screen Protector - £8.49JSAUX 2-Pack Anti-Glare Screen Protector - £8.49(Image: Amazon)As mentioned, a screen protector is almost an essential purchase if you\\'re someone who plans on taking their Switch 2 out of the house. These ones from JSAUX have a trick up their sleeve as they have a matte coating instead of the glossy one used on the console\\'s default screen.A matte screen diffuses the light that hits it instead of reflecting it, which makes the screen much more visible when you\\'ve got lots of light hitting it from different angles.

Learn moreThese are the best controllers to pick up for the Nintendo Switch 2 on launch day.(Image: Joshua Boyles)The Nintendo Switch 2 is here, ringing in a whole new era of gaming for fans or Mario and Zelda alike. Once again, Nintendo has solidified itself as the king of co-operative gaming with the latest console technically including two controllers in the box with it possible to use the Joy-Cons individually.However, if you want to play local co-op games with up to four people, or maybe want to give your guests a more comfortable gaming experience on full-sized pads, you\\'ll need to invest in a spare set of controllers. While the options of new Switch 2 controllers are a little hard to come by at launch, there are a few great choices still available to you.I\\'ve rounded up all the best Nintendo Switch 2 controllers you can currently pick up on launch day. I\\'ll also walk you through how third party controllers work, as well as backwards compatibility with any old devices you might have lying around.Joy-Con 2\\'s - £74.95The new Joy-Con 2\\'s have a C button for Chat functionality.(Image: Nintendo)The Nintendo Switch 2 comes equipped with two of its larger, magnetic Joy-Cons in the box, but you can pick up a spare set for an additional £74.95 if you so choose. These are a great option if you want to quickly boost your controller count to four, as turning them on their side means they can be used individually for a quick game of Mario Kart World.While the original Switch\\'s Joy-Cons were a little fiddly to use in this way, the newer model is much more ergonomic in the hand thanks to the increased size of the new console. The ZL and ZR buttons are also more prominent thanks to their metal construction, so they feel much more premium in the hand than before.The only downside to these controllers is that you\\'ll need to regularly swap them in and out of your Switch 2 console to keep them charged up as they can\\'t be powered by a cable like most traditional pads. Alternatively, you could opt to pick up a charging dock for the Joy-Cons, like this one from Amazon for £19.79.Here are all the best links to purchase a spare set of Joy-Con 2\\'s right now:My Nintendo Store - £74.95Amazon - £74.95The Game Collection - £74.95Very - £74.95HMV - £74.95Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller - £74.95The new Switch 2 Pro Controller has back paddle buttons.(Image: Nintendo)If you\\'re looking for a more premium gaming experience while playing the Nintendo Switch 2, your best option is the latest Switch 2 Pro Controller. This pad ditches the portable features of the Joy-Con\\'s in favour of a more traditional build and layout, with proper handle grips to make for a comfortable play session.The big new addition with this latest version of the controller is the inclusion of some remappable paddle buttons on the rear of the controller. These can be set to any of the other controller inputs, like the face buttons for example, letting you perform actions without ever having to take your thumbs off the sticks.It\\'s a feature that players of competitive games like Splatoon will surely enjoy, but it\\'s also great for some of us more laid-back single-player gamers who always find ourselves opening up the map or inventory menus. Mapping things like start and select to the back mean you can access these menu\\'s much more quickly, making for a more enjoyable gaming experience as a whole.Of course, picking up this controller only adds one additional option to your arsenal, which might not be ideal if you\\'re keen on playing four player Mario Kart. But it is the most premium option available right now, and ideal if you\\'re someone who intends to play a lot of Nintendo Switch 2 in docked mode.Here are the best links to pick up a Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller right now:Amazon - £74.95TheGameCollection- £74.95Nintendo Switch Pro Controller - £49.20The original Switch Pro Controller works on the Nintendo Switch 2.(Image: Nintendo)Looking to save a bit of cash? The original Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller is also compatible with the Switch 2 hardware.That\\'s great news for those who already have one lying around, but it\\'s also great if £74.99 sounds like an extortionate price to shell out for a controller. You can still pick up the original Switch Pro Controller for £49.20 at Amazon, saving you a bit of cash.The main downside is that this version of the controller doesn\\'t have the remappable paddle buttons that the newer version has, and it\\'s also missing that new C button to open the Game Chat menu. However, it does still retain that traditional design that docked players will surely appreciate on longer gaming sessions.I\\'m also particularly a fan of the translucent design this controller has with the inner workings semi-visible through the outer casing. If nothing else, it looks great on a shelf.Here are all the best links to pick up a Nintendo Switch Pro Controller right now:Amazon - £49.20My Nintendo Store - £59.99Argos - £49.99Original Switch Joy-Cons - £58.99Original Joy-Cons work on the Nintendo Switch 2.(Image: Nintendo)Just like the original Pro Controller, Nintendo has confirmed that the original Joy-Con controllers will be compatible with the Switch 2. This is fantastic news if you have a few controllers left over from the last generation, as you can keep these around as fall-back options for when player\\'s two, three and four come round.New versions of the original Joy-Cons are also available for slightly less than the newer models, setting gamers back £58.99 instead of £74.99. However, bear in mind that these controllers are a lot smaller than the new models and a little cramped to use for extended play sessions.You\\'re also missing out on the new C button to open the Chat menu that\\'s included on the new controllers. Additionally, some Nintendo Switch 2 games might not be playable with the old controllers if it requires use of exclusive features like the Mouse Controls.You could opt to pick up a set of pre-owned models for even cheaper, but this carries a pretty big risk of Joy-Con drift, an issue that plagued these controllers for years following the Switch\\'s initial release. If you want the best chance of having these controllers last you a while, it\\'s best to pick up a new set.The good news is that there are several funky colour schemes to choose from since the controllers have been out for almost a decade now. Here are the best links to pick up a set of new Joy-Cons:Amazon - £58.99My Nintendo Store - £69.99Argos - £59.99Currys - £59.99Some third-party controllers may work, but your mileage may varySome third-party controllers may work, but your mileage may vary.(Image: PowerA)Nintendo hasn\\'t yet clarified whether third party controllers that work with the original Nintendo Switch will work with the Switch 2. However, if the original Joy-Cons and Pro Controller are compatible, it\\'s likely that third party devices may also work without too much of a hitch.Again, it\\'s worth considering the sort of games you\\'re going to be playing on Switch 2 before picking up a third party controller. Games that use Mouse Controls won\\'t be compatible with anything other than Joy-Cons 2, and older controllers wont have the C button for Game Chat.Your mileage may vary here, so it could be worth waiting a little while until we get full confirmation that existing third party controllers will work on the new hardware. If you\\'re willing to take the risk though, here are some of the most popular third party Switch controllers from the last few years:PowerA Enhanced Wireless Gamepad - was £37.65, now £28.20ECHTPower Switch Controller - was £19.99, now £16.14VOYEE Wireless Switch Controllers - was £21.99, now £19.998Bitdo Ultimate 2C Bluetooth Controller - £28.87More third-party controllers are coming soonMore third-party controllers are coming soon for the Nintendo Switch 2.(Image: Smyths)As the Nintendo Switch 2 has only just launched, official third party controller options are a little thin on the ground. However, there are a few on the horizon.Article continues belowKeep an eye on these links to pre-order some of the upcoming controllers releasing for the Nintendo Switch 2 in the next few months:PowerA Advantage Wired Controller - £29.99Snakebyte Gamepad S2 Wireless Pro Controller - £34.99\\n```\\n\\n## [We Finally Unbox And Play The Switch 2.

His contributions to politics have been rare but his intervention in the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse by-election is spot on. With Reform expected to perform well, Souness has issued a timely warning to voters that Nigel Farage cannot be trusted. He dismissed Farage as a “chancer” who does not care one jot for the people of Scotland – an analysis we wholeheartedly endorse. The reality is Reform have shamefully dragged this by-election into the gutter with vile race baiting. Their online “advert” falsely claiming Anas Sarwar will “prioritise” Pakistanis was blatant racism – and totally made-up. Doubling down by shelling out even more money on that awful ad just showed how little they care for the truth. Reform have been a toxic presence in this campaign and it is heartening to see them called out by notable Scots.\\nGet the latest news sent straight to your messages by joining our WhatsApp community today.

But nobody should fool themselves that Farage and his Reform rabble have any of the answers we need. Farage in power would destroy the NHS, tear-up workers’ rights and cut tax for his super-rich pals. Voters have a chance to send Farage packing today and they should embrace this opportunity with gusto. Crisis on wards Scotland\\'s NHS is in need of some major surgery to make it fit for purpose. And in reforming our health service, the Scottish Government could do a lot worse than listening to the frontline workers who save lives every day. Today, the Daily Record reports on concerns from NHS cancer specialists over staff shortages causing massive waiting times for diagnosis and treatment. The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) describes the situation as a “ticking time bomb”, with further shortages expected in the next five years. With so many families affected by cancer, it is vital we have enough trained medics to get people treated quickly. We all know early detection can be a life saver. Nobody should have to wait for treatment knowing every passing day could see their condition getting worse. There are no silver bullets that will fix our health service – which is in desperate need of resources and reform. But listening to warnings from frontline medics is vital to any solution.

As a Conservative, of course I want taxes to be as low as possible. But that must be achieved responsibly through fiscal discipline.”The shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, will say ‘for a few weeks, we put at risk the very stability which Conservatives had always said must be carefully protected’. Photograph: James Manning/PAStride will admit that while the Tories moved swiftly to limit the damage – the main tax cut was reversed in little more than a week, Kwasi Kwarteng was sacked as chancellor within three weeks, and Truss quit six days later – the party’s standing has taken a long-term hit.“Back then mistakes were recognised and stability restored within weeks, with the full backing of our party,” he said. “But the damage to our credibility is not so easily undone. That will take time. And it also requires contrition. So let me be clear: never again will the Conservative party undermine fiscal credibility by making promises we cannot afford.”Truss hit back, releasing a statement which called Stride “one of the Conservative MPs who kowtowed to the failed Treasury orthodoxy and was set on undermining my plan for growth from the moment I beat his chosen candidate for the party leadership [Rishi Sunak]”.She added: “Until Mel Stride admits the economic failings of the last Conservative government, the British public will not trust the party with the reins of power again.”Expressing a dim view of Truss’s record is not a particularly risky stance to take, with polling shortly before she resigned showing just 11% of voters thought she was doing a good job as prime minister. But previously Badenoch and her shadow team have avoided much direct criticism of Truss.When asked about Truss, Badenoch has generally said the party needs to move on from debates about her premiership, although in January it emerged that she had told her shadow cabinet “it would be best if Liz would shut up for a while”.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionIn his speech, Stride is to say that, however misguided, Truss’s keenness for an economic reset was “in part born of exasperation with the failure of successive governments to put us on a path back to sustained growth and rising living standards”.He will say: “The fact is for a large swathe of the population our economy simply has not been working for them for some considerable time. Incomes have stagnated. Many feel that the system only works for the benefit of others, for large corporations, or people from other countries, but not for them and their families.”Insisting the answer is not the “magic money tree” populism of Reform, Stride will call for restrictions to public spending, particularly on social security, and supply-side changes to boost productivity.\\n```\\n\\n## [Rachel Reeves loses huge net zero battle with Ed Miliband](https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/2064588/rachel-reeves-loses-huge-net) (#104467)\\n\\n> 2025-06-05 06:53:00+00:00\\n\\n```\\nThe Treasury had hoped to cut the £13.2 billion warm homes plan, which aims to insulate properties and make them more efficient.

A rapidly expanding petition on the parliamentary website has garnered 63,000 signatures demanding reforms.As it stands, individuals over 60 in Scotland, NI and Wales benefit from complimentary bus travel. In England, however, only certain areas like Merseyside and London offer this perk due to local authorities lacking funds.The petition, accessible here, with 63,285 supporters states: \"We call on the Government to extend free bus travel to all people over 60 years old in England outside London. We believe the current situation is unjust and we want equality for everyone over 60.\"It further argues: \"Currently, people in England who do not live in London are not entitled to free bus travel until they reach the state pension age, which we believe has changed dramatically. As people get older some over 60s drive less and less, therefore we believe we need equality on public transport. It would mean England had the same provision as Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\"Labour\\'s Markus Campbell-Savours raised an official enquiry in Parliament yesterday, questioning Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander \"on the implications of providing free bus passes to the over-60s concerning social inclusion, the economy, and the environment.\"In response, Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Transport Simon Lightwood this week cautioned about the possible financial cost of any amendments, yet he signalled optimism due to recent budget allocations to local authorities that could be used to supply free passes for over 60s.Mr Lightwood replied: \"The English National Concessionary Travel Scheme (ENCTS) provides free off-peak bus travel to those with eligible disabilities and those of state pension age, currently sixty-six.\"The ENCTS costs around £700 million annually and any changes to the statutory obligations, would therefore need to be carefully considered for its impact on the scheme\\'s financial sustainability. No assessment has been made of the potential impact of lowering the age on social inclusion, the economy or the environment.\"Emphasising the versatility within local governance, he added: \"Local authorities in England have the power to offer concessions in addition to their statutory obligations such as lowering the age of eligibility. Additional local concessions are provided and funded by local authorities from local resources.\"The government has confirmed £955 million for the 2025 to 2026 financial year to support and improve bus services in England outside London. This includes £243 million for bus operators and £712 million allocated to local authorities across the country. Funding allocated to local authorities to improve services for passengers can be used in whichever way they wish. This could include extending the discretionary concessions available in local areas to support the local economy and environment.\"To view the petition and a full response from the Department for

needed’](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/campaigners-government-keir-starmer-charities-england-b1231324.html) (#104583)\\n\\n> 2025-06-05 07:04:26+00:00\\n\\n```\\nCharities have welcomed the expansion of free school meals as a “first step” towards easing child poverty, but urged the Government to axe the two-child benefit cap as economists warned the scope of the change would be limited.Campaigners and school leaders said the change, which will see all pupils in families that claim universal credit in England made eligible for the scheme, will relieve pressure on household budgets.But organisations including the NSPCC, the National Children’s Bureau and Action for Children insisted the abolition of the two-child welfare rule was still needed.Meanwhile, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warned the expansion would “not see anything like 100,000 children lifted out of poverty next year” and that lifting the cap “would have a lower cost per child lifted out of poverty.”The Government said the change would lift 100,000 children out of poverty (Danny Lawson/PA)PA ArchiveThe cap, which was introduced in 2017, restricts child tax credit and universal credit to two children in most households.Hundreds of thousands more pupils across the country will be able to access means-tested free school meals when the provision is extended from September 2026, the Department for Education (DfE) announced on Thursday.Currently, households in England on\\xa0universal\\xa0credit\\xa0must earn below £7,400 a year (after tax and not including benefits) to qualify for free school meals.But the Government has announced that every pupil whose household is on\\xa0universal\\xa0credit\\xa0will have a new entitlement to free school lunches from the start of the 2026/27 academic year.The move comes after campaigners and education leaders have called for free school meals to be extended to all children whose families are on\\xa0universal\\xa0credit\\xa0to ease pressures on young people living in poverty.Nearly 2.1 million pupils – almost one in four of all pupils (24.6%) – in England were eligible for free school meals in January 2024.The DfE has said more than half a million more children are expected to benefit from a free meal every school day as a result of the expansion, and nearly £500 will be put back into parents’ pockets every year.Sir Keir Starmer has indicated he is considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap but declined to give further details ahead of the autumn (Stefan Rousseau/PA)PA WireIt suggested that the expansion will lift 100,000 children across England completely out of poverty.Chris Sherwood, chief executive of the NSPCC, said the move was a “welcome step in the right direction” and “a lifeline for many families who are struggling to survive in this cost-of-living crisis”.But he added: “By removing the two-child limit, the government could lift over 350,000 children out of poverty, which, if coupled with an ambitious child poverty strategy later in the year, would help tackle the crisis children are facing.”Action for Children chief executive Paul Carberry said the changes would make a “big difference” but “by itself, it can’t deliver the bold, ambitious reduction in child poverty that the Prime Minister has promised”.Sir Keir Starmer has indicated he is considering scrapping the two-child limit amid the prospect of a backbench rebellion over the policy, but has declined to give further details ahead of the publication of the Government’s flagship child poverty strategy in the autumn.Mr Carberry said: “This must set out a comprehensive and funded plan to fix our inadequate social security system, beginning with the abolition of the cruel two-child limit and benefit cap.”Anna Feuchtwang, chief executive of the National Children’s Bureau, said the expansion should be a “down payment” on further investment in addressing child poverty in the autumn.She said it was “crucial” that the Government reconsiders its position on the two-child limit for the autumn.Anna Taylor, executive director of The Food Foundation, called it a “landmark day for children”.She said: “The expansion of free school meals is supported by the overwhelming majority of people in the UK – regardless of how they vote.“We all know that feeding our children well, whatever their background is not rocket science, it is about priorities and today the government put children first.”The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that in the long term, the change would mean free lunches for about 1.7 million additional children, but that in the short run, the announcement would benefit “considerably fewer pupils”.Christine Farquharson, associate director at the think tank, said: “Transitional protections introduced in 2018 have substantially increased the number of children receiving free school meals today – so in the short run, today’s announcement will both cost considerably less (around £250 million a year) and benefit considerably fewer pupils (the government’s estimate is 500,000 children).“This also means that today’s announcement will not see anything like 100,000

reduce child poverty, there are other measures – such as lifting the two-child limit – that would have a lower cost per child lifted out of poverty.”\\n```\\n\\n## [Rachel Reeves and Keir Starmer are

05:01:54+00:00\\n\\n```\\nOh what a mess we made, as the late Amy Winehouse once put it of a dysfunctional relationship. It’s a torch song that might be on Downing Street playlists as the Government heads into what insiders call “everything month” — the period intended to be the zenith of the political year, launched this week with a major defence review, then hurtling to the big sorting hat of the spending review next Wednesday — and nervous hopes that the promise of a trade agreement with the US will turn from promise to reality, despite another round of delay in finalising implementation from an unreliable White House. Spending tussles already unleashed a bloodbath between a “quad” of influential Cabinet figures and a chancellor tied into an over-tight fiscal corset, with a flurry of costs coming down the line and tensions with her No\\u200910 neighbour and boss. The Starmer-Reeves duo faced a tsunami of rebellions over benefit cuts, anxiety over the lack of a clear upward growth trend and a run of odd “moments” which have either dissolved into messy communications — or led to questions about Labour’s grip on the machinery of power.Overall, the Government feels tetchy and listless: Keir Starmer himself sounded uncertain as to whether he sees a long-term residency behind the glossy black door, answering tautly to a questioner who asked him about his plans that “you’re getting way ahead of me”. It feels, as one senior backbencher who was called in for a pep talk put it, “like one of those schools put in special measures where the head teacher is as stressed as the staff and the playground is always on the brink of chaos”. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he would not resile from his duty to stabilise the economyPA WireFighting fires on all frontsIt’s not hard to spot the causes of the political kryptonite besetting a government which flew into office not yet a year ago on a handsome majority. Newcomers brought into the No\\u200910 team were aghast at how little policy preparation had been done for the enormity of fixing creaking welfare systems and enabling an upgrade of an NHS lagging in data, AI and technology advances. “We had a long time out of power and the Corbyn stint to boot, and we forgot what ‘good’ looks like,” one of the No\\u200910 delivery “boosters” brought in to amp up results confided to me. Add to that the relentless march of Reform in the local elections.Starmer took the fight to Nigel Farage’s economic recipe — “Liz Truss 2.0” — and asked if voters could trust Nigel. But it’s doubtful whether fighting rhetorical battles with a figure who thrives on conflict will change much at this point: when voters move towards more extreme solutions, they are signalling a lack of faith in the more orthodox alternatives. Simply telling them that they are falling for a charlatan doesn’t cure the root cause of disaffection.Starmer’s threat of an ‘island of strangers’ felt alien to the way a serious man would speakMeanwhile the PM’s strategy feels like the posture of a man trying to stay upright on one leg on a balance ball. He has also embraced aspects of Farage-ism in his own rhetoric — the threat of an “island of strangers” felt alien to the way a serious man would speak.By any standards, Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves have their hands full and new pressures, not least from a looming defence bill — no one close to this week’s slightly scrappy presentation of the UK’s options thinks that the three per cent target can be reached without substantial tax rises. But more and more MPs are voicing a preference for the kind of wealth-tax wielding plans of Angela Rayner — YouGov’s polling on Cabinet popularity this week (which is really a study in who is less unpopular than others) places her streets ahead, with Starmer and Reeves bottom of the pops. Reeves, who this week announced £15bn for trams, trains and buses outside London, has spent the past couple of weeks fending off bids for more cash from Rayner for housing, as well as Home Secretary Yvette Cooper and Energy Secretary Ed Miliband. And the PM has effectively “scooped” her decisions, by pledging to restore the winter fuel allowance to pensioners and suggesting that the cap on benefits and tax credits for families with more than two children will be removed to appease party ire.Rachel Reeves this week announced £15bn for trams, trains and buses outside LondonGetty ImagesDynamism turned to self-doubt It is not fun being the one person who has to learn to count in a government flailing to meet its pledges not to raise core taxes — and with a party (and increasingly, colleagues) which has never loved fiscal restraint. Half of Reeves’s £10\\u2009billion fiscal headroom to stick to her targets would disappear if the softenings Starmer proposes were fully reversed. Rises in NHS spending — a major plank of the Government’s plan to show real-world impact — are a done deal, which is why Wes Streeting, the cocksure Health Secretary, has a spring in his step. But even the fortunate in this unhappy house of government is a step away from someone else’s frustration. Streeting’s partner Joe Dancey, installed as the Labour Party’s main communications chief, has had a torrid few months of accusations that the party brand has become “soggy” (as one internal critic puts it).Starmer’s ‘can do’ attitude has gone missing, replaced by angsty self-doubt and blame-shiftingStarmer became Prime Minister, if not by accident, then certainly not by design — and succeeded. That sense of “can do” however has gone missing, replaced by angsty self-doubt and blame-shifting. The central remedy is for Starmer to decide more clearly what he wants his government to do — and what sacrifices he is prepared to make in personnel and policies to define it. Without that, he is missing what makes the “Prime” Minister truly prime.Anne McElvoy is co-host of the daily podcast, Politics at Sam and Anne’s\\n```\\n\\n## [Tories attempt to banish the ghost of Liz Truss-era turmoil](https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/2064478/tories-attempt-banish-ghost-liz) (#105539)\\n\\n> 2025-06-05 03:00:00+00:00\\n\\n```\\nShadow Chancellor Mel Stride will attempt to draw a line under the turmoil unleashed by Liz Truss’s 2022 mini-Budget in a major speech this morning.Sir Keir Starmer hammers the Conservatives for the legacy of the chaos on Ms Truss’s watch, which is widely blamed for painful hikes in interest rates. Mr Stride will attempt to win back the trust of voters on the economy as the Tories fight to escape their third-place position in many polls.He will acknowledge the damage to the economy and the party’s reputation, saying: “For a few weeks, we put at risk the very stability which Conservatives had always said must be carefully protected. The credibility of the UK’s economic framework was undermined by spending billions on subsidising energy bills, and tax cuts, with no proper plan for how this would be paid for.”Mr Stride will acknowledge “damage to our credibility” is not “easily undone,” adding: “That will take time. And it also requires contrition.”Insisting that the upheavals of the past will not return, he will say: “So let me be clear: Never again will the Conservative Party undermine fiscal credibility by making promises we cannot afford.”Mr Stride will argue the 2022 crisis was “in part born of exasperation with the failure of successive governments to put us on a path back to sustained growth and rising living standards”.“Many feel that the system only works for the benefit of others, for large corporations, or people from other countries, but not for them and their families,” he will say. “We must accept that for too long governments of both colours have failed to free us from this malaise.“For our party to find a path back to regaining trust, we must show that we are serious about listening to people and creating a better future underpinned by a credible plan.”The Shadow Chancellor will also use his speech to fire a shot at Nigel Farage’s Reform UK, declaring: “Their economic prescription is pure populism. It doubles down on the ‘magic money tree’ we thought had been banished with Jeremy Corbyn.“They would plough ahead with huge additional welfare spending, as well as tax cuts, with no plan for how to pay for any of it. We must be radical in our prospectus, but that must be grounded in the principles of stability and responsibility.”Looking ahead to next week’s spending review, he state: “By borrowing hundreds of billions more than the plans she inherited and pushing up the rates we pay on that borrowing, Rachel Reeves has added nearly £80bn to our expected debt interest bill over the course of this parliament. At the spending review next week, we can expect her to trumpet all of the additional projects and programmes she is funding – without mentioning the fact it is all being paid for from borrowing.”Adamant there is still a role for the Tories, he will say: “When other parties are descending into a race to the bottom on economic credibility and responsibility, the Conservative Party is needed now perhaps more than ever. But to win that fight we will need thoughtfulness.“We will need to take our time if we are to forge a credible plan that delivers for the people of our country. Over the next four years our party will do just that.”Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice rejected Mr Stride\\'s criticism, saying: “We’ll take no lectures on economics from a party that more than doubled the national debt, raised taxes and government spending to 70-year highs and shrank economic growth to 70-year lows... They can never be trusted again.”\\n```\\n\\n## [Reeves\\' new pension rules \\'omission\\' as key issue on \\'back burner\\'](https://www.express.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/2064571/reeves-new-pension-rules-omission-key-issue-back-burner) (#105830)\\n\\n> 2025-06-05 05:25:00+00:00\\n\\n```\\nThe Pension Schemes Bill will create \"bigger and better pension funds\" and combine smaller pension pots, the Government said By\\xa0Steven Smith, Content Editor 06:25, Thu, Jun 5, 2025 | UPDATED: 06:27, Thu, Jun 5, 2025 Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves (Image: Getty Images)Sweeping reforms to tidy up the fragmented pensions landscape are detailed in a new parliamentary Bill, promising to build \"megafunds\" and eradicate numerous \"micro\" retirement savings. The Pension Schemes Bill aims to craft \"bigger and better pension funds\" by amalgamating smaller pension pots, as per Government statements - but it has already drawn criticism for doing \\'nothing to tackle the fundamental problem\\'.The common issue of workers accruing multiple modest pension amounts, which become cumbersome to manage with frequent job changes, is addressed in the Bill, which will consolidate micro pension pots valued at or below £1,000 into a single scheme.As individuals near retirement age, the legislation will compel schemes to present unambiguous, default choices to convert savings into a steady retirement income.Furthermore, the Bill introduces stringent regulations ushering in vast multi-employer defined contribution (DC) scheme megafunds with a minimum value of £25 billion, exploiting scale to diversify investments.According to Government officials, defined benefit (DB) pension systems will receive augmented leeway to \"safely\" allocate surplus assets collectively worth £160 billion, intended to bolster employer investment ventures and enhance member benefits.Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said: \"The Bill is about securing better value for savers\\' pensions and driving long-term investment in British businesses to boost economic growth in our country.\"Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall (Image: Parliament TV)Chancellor Rachel Reeves called the plans \"a game changer\".Pensions minister Torsten Bell added: \"Pension saving is a long game, but getting this right is urgent so that millions can look forward to a higher income in retirement.\"But former Liberal Democrat pensions minister and now partner at LCP, Sir Steve Webb has criticised the new Bill for its lack of significant action on boosting pension savings, saying: \"Whilst there are many worthy measures in the Bill, the biggest omission is action to get more money flowing into pensions.\"This issue is unfortunately on the back burner. Measures such as consolidating tiny pension pots are helpful tidying up measures, but do nothing to tackle the fundamental problem that millions of us simply do not have enough money set aside for our retirement.\"With every passing year that this issue goes unaddressed, time is running out for people already well through their working life to have the chance for a decent retirement.\"Patrick Heath-Lay, chief executive of People\\'s Partnership which provides the People\\'s Pension, praised some aspects of the Bill: \"The Bill contains many measures that will require providers to deliver better outcomes for savers and improve the workplace pension system.\"We are encouraged by the introduction of default consolidator schemes, which will be the most effective way to solve the dormant small pots problem.\"Andy Briggs, the CEO of Phoenix Group, said: \"The Bill sets a clear direction for the future of pensions with the emphasis on building scale and ensuring savers receive value for money.\"Ian Cornelius, CEO of Nest, said: \"We believe that large, well-governed schemes can drive great outcomes for their members by using their scale and expertise to diversify where money is invested, and gain access to attractive investment opportunities not available to smaller investors at low cost.\"Nausicaa Delfas, chief executive of the Pensions Regulator, commented on the future-proofing efforts: \"Making sure all schemes are focused on delivering value for money, helping to stop small, and often forgotten pension pots forming, and guiding savers towards the right retirement products for them, will mean savers benefit from a system fit for the future.\" Invalid emailWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you\\'ve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The details will be crucial and we will scrutinise the Bill to ensure it puts the interests of savers first.\"She also highlighted the pressing issue of current pension contributions: \"We also urgently need to tackle the level of pension contributions which are too low to create an adequate retirement income for many.

Currently, their household must earn less than £7,400 a year to qualify.The government says the change will make 500,000 more pupils eligible, which the prime minister said would \"help families who need it most\". Labour has faced scrutiny over plans to tackle child poverty, and is yet to decide whether to scrap the two-child benefit cap.Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson told the BBC ministers were \"working as quickly as we can\" on next year\\'s plans to extend free school meals.Ministers said the changes to free school meals would save parents £500 a year and \"lift 100,000 children out of poverty\".On the two-child benefit cap, which prevents most families from claiming means-tested benefits for any third or additional children born after April 2017, Phillipson was asked if there were plans to change this policy.The education secretary told BBC Breakfast it was not a \"silver bullet\" but \"it was on the table.\" She has previously said the government is looking at scrapping it but that it would cost a lot of money.On free school meals, the Department for Education has set aside £1bn to fund the change up to 2029.They have also pledged £13m to a dozen food charities across England to \"fight food poverty\", by redistributing food from farms. Sir Keir Starmer said: \"Feeding more children every day, for free, is one of the biggest interventions we can make to put more money in parents\\' pockets, tackle the stain of poverty, and set children up to learn.\"The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank said that while the rule change would cut child poverty to a degree and would be cheaper than making free school meals universal, \"other measures - such as lifting the two-child limit - would have a lower cost per child lifted out of poverty\".Christine Farquharson, associate director of the IFS, said in a statement that today\\'s announcement would \"not see anything like 100,000 children lifted out of poverty next year\". She said protections put in place in 2018 have already increased the number of children receiving free school meals. They ensure children don\\'t lose eligibility for free school meals when their family circumstances change.The changes are due to come into effect at the start of the 2026 academic year.The announcement has been largely welcomed by the education sector and organisations campaigning against child poverty.Nick Harrison, chief executive of the Sutton Trust charity, said it was a \"significant step towards taking hunger out of the classroom\".Pepe Di\\'Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders union, said it was \"great news\".\"There is much more to be done - but this is a welcome step forward,\" he added. Kate Anstey, head of education policy at the Child Poverty Action Group, said the extension would cover \"all children in poverty and those at risk of poverty\", with the current criteria only accounting for around two-thirds of those children.She called it a \"game-changer for children and families\", but called on the government to go further.\"We hope this is a sign of what\\'s to come in the autumn\\'s child poverty strategy, with government taking more action to meet its manifesto commitment to reduce child poverty in the UK,\" she said.Liberal Democrat spokesperson Munira Wilson said: \"This can only be a first step. To end the cost of learning crisis, the government needs to commit to auto-enrolling eligible children for free school meals, lifting the two-child benefit cap, and capping uniform costs to truly change the lives of children in poverty.\"Charities have called for the two-child benefit cap to be abolished in next week\\'s spending review.The government is expected to announce its decision in the autumn, when it publishes its child poverty strategy.Sir Keir said he was \"absolutely determined that we will drive down child poverty\" during Prime Minister\\'s Questions on Wednesday.But Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch accused him of \"causing confusion\" over the policy.Who can claim free school meals?The total number of children registered for free school meals in England is about 2.1 million, or 24.6% of the total pupil population, according to the latest data. Families in England need to meet certain criteria for their children to be eligible.That can include receiving Universal Credit but, until the changes are implemented next September, parents also must have a household income of less than £7,400 a year, after tax.Parents have to apply for their children to receive them and eligible children are not automatically enrolled.In February, MPs on the cross-party education committee called for that to change.They said tens of thousands of eligible children were missing out on free school meals because their parents were not claiming them - often because of language barriers or difficulty with the administrative process.Children\\'s eligibility for free school meals varies across the UK.All primary school children in London and in Wales can access free meals.In Scotland, all children in the first five years of primary school are eligible, as well as all children from families receiving the Scottish Child Payment benefit.Parents in Northern Ireland can apply if they receive certain benefits and are below an income threshold which is approximately double the current England level, at £15,000.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

She confirmed yesterday that an expansion of eligibility rules will be in place by this winter but did not confirm who would be eligible.\\u200cCurrently, only pensioners are eligible if they receive pension credit, which can be claimed by OAPs whose income is less than £11,500. The Treasury is said to be looking at linking the payments to people\\'s incomes instead of pension credit.\\u200cMinisters would do this by initially giving back the up to £300 payments as a universal benefit to 10 million pensioners, according to multiple reports. They would then recoup the money from about five million OAPs through higher tax bills over the next financial year.READ MORE: Winter fuel payments WILL be available to more pensioners this year says Rachel ReevesChancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to set out the details of the Government\\'s winter fuel payments U-turn next week (Image: Jason Roberts /Manchester Evening News)Jonathan Athow, a senior director at HMRC, yesterday highlighted how a similar system works for child benefit. “What we have done with the child benefit charge shows there is a flexibility in the tax system that shows it does not require self-assessment,” he told MPs.Article continues belowBut the Guardian raised concerns that some bereaved families could face requests for their dead relatives to return winter fuel payments. This is because there could be a six-month gap between pensioners receiving the initial payment and then some being asked to return it when they fill in their tax returns, the newspaper said. There are fears thousands of pensioners could have died in that time.Asked about the reports, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson today refused to be drawn on the details. She said: \"I can\\'t comment on speculation. It\\'s not for me to make announcements around precise mechanisms as to how this will be delivered, but what I can say is that we do want more pensioners to receive the winter fuel allowance and the Chancellor (and) the Prime Minister will set out how that will happen. \"She added that she did not think \"multi-millionaires\" should get the winter fuel allowance.\\u200cMs Reeves yesterday said pensioners will get the winter fuel allowance this year. Pressed by the Mirror on winter fuel payment eligibility at an event in Rochdale, the Chancellor said: “We have listened to the concerns people had about the level of the means test.“So we will be making changes to that. They will be in place so that pensioners will be paid for this coming winter.\" It comes after pensioners were left in the dark on how many people would be eligible - and when the changes would come into effect.\\u200cThe Government announced cuts to the winter fuel payments not long after the election last year. They faced a huge backlash after stopping the support being paid universally and instead changing to a means-tested system.Pensions Minister Torsten Bell yesterday ruled out returning to universal winter fuel payments. He confirmed the Government will not be returning to a system in which millionaires receive the benefit.He told MPs: \"On your question of is there any prospect of a universal winter fuel payment, the answer is no, the principle I think most people, 95% of people, agree, that it\\'s not a good idea that we have a system paying a few hundreds of pounds to millionaires, and so we\\'re not going to be continuing with that.

Fast rail from Liverpool to Hull, HS2 to Manchester and Leeds. Even at one point, a tunnel through the Pennines. Northern Powerhouse. Levelling Up.All promised. None delivered.This time, she says it will be different, announcing £15.6billion of investment into city transport in the North and Midlands.Buses, trams, new stations; £2.5billion for Greater Manchester and new tram stops in Bury, Oldham, and the tram to reach Stockport.On the other side of the Pennines, £2.1billion to start building West Yorkshire Mass Transit by 2028. And more projects from Tyne and Wear to Birmingham.At a bus manufacturer in Rochdale, Reeves announced that the Government is “committed to growth everywhere”, and that the Treasury’s Green Book rules were being torn up (which tend to favour the capital and South East).Katherine Forster quizzed Andy Burnham in Rochdale over Britain\\'s broken transport networkGB NewsNext week’s Spending Review will bring hard choices, as increased defence spending and global uncertainty over trade make Reeves’s task all the harder.Real-terms cuts are coming. And tax rises are likely.So the Government yesterday was trying to get on the front foot. And Labour have been bruised by its drubbing in the local elections last month. Many of their own MPs, fearful of losing their seats after just one term, have been pushing for spending in the North.Back in January, Reeves announced an infrastructure splurge, which focused on London and the South East.They seem to have learnt some lessons from that. But is yesterday\\'s announcement all it’s cracked up to be?Rachel Reeves delivers a speech during a visit to Mellor Bus in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, to announce a multi-billion-pound boost for city transport in the North and the MidlandsPAThe Conservatives have accused Labour of “copying and pasting” their old pledges. And it’s true that there are striking similarities with promises made by Rishi Sunak to the North when he stood in a former railway station in Manchester back in 2023 and ditched the last remaining Northern leg of HS2.And, the announcements were of funding for mayoralty regions. So questions about rail links between Northern cities went unanswered.Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham introduced the Chancellor. He was upbeat when I talked to him for GB News.He told me: “I\\'m confident, because people can see the change that we\\'re already making. So, this isn\\'t sort of pie in the sky or it\\'ll happen one day. We\\'re doing it.” Andy Burnham introduced the Chancellor at the eventPAHe pledges “the best integrated public transport system outside of London by the end of the decade” and with “the lowest fares possible”.But on rail, he adds: “As good as today\\'s news was, I will not be letting the Chancellor or the Government off the hook. Because when it comes to rail travel between the big cities of the north, it\\'s nowhere near good enough. “And the point I keep making is, why should people here be treated as second-class citizens when it comes to rail travel? Why should people lose half a morning if they\\'re trying to go between Manchester and Leeds? They shouldn\\'t. And we\\'ve had to put up with that for far too long.”He and Liverpool Mayor Steve Rotherham are pushing for “an Elizabeth line for the north west between Liverpool and Manchester with five stops. No more. That would be a new spine for the public transport system in the north west of England.”The money is coming from capital spending, so not hampered by the strict fiscal rules Reeves has imposed on day-to-day spending. On schools, prisons, local Government and elsewhere, there is likely pain to come.The projects will take many years, and people I spoke to are sceptical. There’s agreement that today’s plans sound good, “but will they be delivered?” one employee mused.That is the question. 16 million people in the North have heard it all before.For their sake, and for the Government’s own chances of getting back into power, they will need to be.\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

The 50-year-old says she never intended to hurt them and it was a tragic accident.Prosecutors on Thursday suggested photos found on her phone showing wild fungi being weighed depict her measuring the amount required to kill her guests.Ms Patterson told the court she had likely taken the photos in question but said she didn\\'t believe the mushrooms in them were death caps.Ms Patterson\\'s in-laws, Don and Gail Patterson, both 70, along with Gail\\'s sister Heather Wilkinson, 66, all fell ill and died days after the lunch. Heather\\'s husband, local pastor Ian Wilkinson, was also hospitalised but recovered after coming out of a weeks-long induced coma.The high-profile trial, which started almost six weeks ago, has already heard from more than 50 prosecution witnesses. Ms Patterson became the first defence witness to take the stand on Monday afternoon.Under cross-examination from the lead prosecutor, Ms Patterson admitted she had foraged for wild mushrooms in the three months before the July lunch, despite telling police and a health official that she hadn\\'t. The court was also shown images, taken in late April 2023 and recovered from Ms Patterson\\'s phone, which depicted mushrooms being weighed.Ms Patterson previously admitted she had repeatedly deleted electronic data in the days following the lunch because she feared that if officers found such pictures they would blame her for the guests\\' deaths.Pointing to earlier evidence from a fungi expert who said the mushrooms in the images were \"highly consistent\" with death caps, Dr Rogers alleged Ms Patterson had knowingly foraged them days before.She had seen a post on iNaturalist - a website for logging plant and animal sightings - and travelled to the Loch area ten days later on 28 April to pick the toxic fungi, Dr Rogers alleged.Ms Patterson said she couldn\\'t recall if she went to the town that day, but denied she went there to find death cap mushrooms or that she had seen the iNaturalist post.\"I suggest that you were weighing these mushrooms so that you could calculate the weight required for... a fatal dose,\" Dr Rogers put to her.\"Disagree,\" Ms Patterson replied.The mother-of-two also spoke about putting powdered dried mushrooms into a range of foods like spaghetti, brownies and stew, which prosecutors allege was practice for the fatal lunch. Ms Patterson said this was not true, but rather an attempt to get \"extra vegetables into my kids\\' bodies\".Prosecutors repeatedly asked her, with different wording each time, whether she had knowingly used the same food dehydrator to prepare death cap mushrooms for the lunch.CCTV played at the trial shows Ms Patterson disposing of the appliance at a local dump.\"That\\'s why you rushed out, the day after your release from [hospital], to get rid of the evidence,\" Dr Rogers said.\"No,\" replied Ms Patterson.Earlier, Ms Patterson\\'s barrister asked her why she repeatedly lied to police about foraging mushrooms and having a food dehydrator.\"It was this stupid knee-jerk reaction to dig deeper and keep lying,\" she told the court. \"I was just scared, but I shouldn\\'t have done it.\"Ms Patterson also repeated her claim that she never intentionally put the poisonous fungi in the meal.She said the mushrooms used in the beef Wellington may have accidentally included dried, foraged varieties that were kept in a container with store-bought ones.Ms Patterson was also quizzed on evidence given by other witnesses that she had asked her guests to come to the lunch to discuss health issues, namely a cancer diagnosis. She said she didn\\'t outright say she had cancer, but still shouldn\\'t have misled her relatives, saying she\\'d done so partly because their concern made her feel loved.\"I suggest that you never thought you would have to account for this lie about having cancer because you thought the lunch guests would die,\" Dr Rogers said. \"Your lie would never be found out.\"\"That\\'s not true,\" Ms Patterson said.She will resume being cross examined on Friday.\\n```\\n\\n## [Death caps and cancer claims: how Erin Patterson responded to first day of mushroom trial cross-examination](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/05/erin-patterson-mushroom-lunch-trial-cross-examination-death-cap-ntwnfb) (#103862)\\n\\n> 2025-06-05 07:23:45+00:00\\n\\n```\\nErin Patterson has denied deliberately foraging death cap mushrooms and weighing them to calculate the fatal dose for a person, but admitted a series of lies to police as homicide detectives investigated the fatal lunch.On her fourth day in the witness box, Patterson’s cross examination started, and the jury was told the estimate for the trial had blown out by at least a fortnight.Patterson, 50, faces three charges of murder and one charge of attempted murder relating to poisoning four in-laws with beef wellington served for lunch at her house in Leongatha on 29 July 2023.Patterson has pleaded not guilty to murdering her estranged husband Simon Patterson’s parents, Don and Gail Patterson, and his aunt Heather Wilkinson, and attempting to murder Ian Wilkinson, Simon’s uncle and Heather’s husband.Early in her cross-examination by prosecutor Nanette Rogers SC, Patterson was shown images of mushrooms on scales.Crown prosecutor Nanette Rogers leaves the Latrobe Valley magistrates court in Morwell, Victoria on Wednesday. Photograph: James Ross/AAPShe agreed the photos appeared to have been taken by her in her home.Rogers told Patterson that Dr Tom May, a mushrooms expert who gave evidence earlier in the trial, identified with a high degree of confidence that the images showed death cap mushrooms.Rogers suggested to Patterson that an image of sliced mushrooms on a dehydrator tray placed on scales showed death caps she picked on 28 April 2023 in Loch. A public post on iNaturalist earlier that month identified them growing there, and the exact location.“I suggest you were weighing these death cap mushrooms so that you could calculate the weight required to calculate the administration of a fatal dose for one person,” Rogers asked Patterson, before also suggesting that she calculated the weight required for fatal doses for five people.Patterson denied both suggestions.TimelineErin Patterson: how Australia\\'s alleged mushroom poisoning case unfolded — a timelineShow29 July 2023Erin Patterson hosts lunch for estranged husband Simon’s parents, Don and Gail Patterson, and his aunt and uncle Heather and Ian Wilkinson.

Illustration: Guardian DesignRogers then suggested to Patterson that she lied about having cancer to her lunch guests as “you thought the lunch guests would die … and your lie would never be found out”.“That’s not true,” Patterson responded.Under questioning from her lawyer, Colin Mandy SC, earlier on Thursday, Patterson said she repeatedly lied to police during her interview with detectives on 5 August about her food dehydrator.The dehydrator was later recovered at a local tip with her fingerprints on it, and with traces of death cap mushrooms on it.“And why did you tell the police those lies on the 5th of August?” Mandy asked.Australia\\'s mushroom trial update: lead detective and mycologists among witnesses called – video“Well I had disposed of it a few days earlier, in the context of thinking that maybe mushrooms that I’d foraged or the meal I’d prepared was responsible for making people sick,” Patterson responded.“And then on the Saturday, Detective Eppingstall told me Gail and Heather had passed away, and it was this stupid kneejerk reaction to just dig deeper, and keep lying.“I was just scared. But I shouldn’t have done it.”Mandy finished his questioning of Patterson by running through the names of each of her lunch guests, and asking if she had intended to kill them, cause them really serious injury, or harm them in any way.She answered in the negative to each question, shaking her head and crying when Mandy finished the series of questions by asking about Ian, who was seated in the court.Justice Christopher Beale told the jury that it was expected the trial would continue for at least two more weeks, with Patterson’s evidence possibly stretching into next week.The trial continues.\\n```\\n\\n## [Erin Patterson gives evidence for fourth day in Australia mushroom trial](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV0FVX3lxTE93RGlFS21UTUItQTNhWUxva1N1LTdPVF8zSTBsVmk4YzhLV3Zfd0JqQVpnTVVRdm1JR3JFQW42MlBDR2pBRDdZazQ4dFdJQWdUVmY3YjFUOA?oc=5) (#104262)\\n\\n> 2025-06-05 02:28:10+00:00\\n\\n```\\nOur full story from todaypublished at 07:59 British Summer Time07:59 BSTpublished at 06:5906:59\\nThis live coverage is ending now, but you can read our full story on the day in court here.

Earlier today, Judge Christopher Bealeset out a rough timeline for the 14-member jury – who were expecting the trial to last around six weeks.But this is already week six, and he warns them there\\'s still a way to go.\"I’m not going to put a figure on how much time is left to run in this trial but let me just summarise for you,\" he said. Ms Patterson will most likely be in the witness box until early next week, followed by a few days of legal discussion and the possibility of \"more evidence\".The prosecution and defence will give their closing addresses and then, Justice Beale said, he\\'ll deliver final directions which \"takes quite a bit of time\".Then the jury will deliberate – and he said he can\\'t put an exact date on this.He reminded the jury they should take all the time they need. He joked that next week is a shorter one as there\\'s a public holiday on Monday – \"some good news\" – to much laughter from the jury members.\\nRe-cap of the day: Dehydrators, kitchen scales and emojispublished at 07:36 British Summer Time07:36 BSTpublished at 06:3606:36Lana LamLive digital reporter\\nFor the fourth day in a row, Erin Patterson gave evidence in her triple murder case.

She says she is struggling to express what she meant by that. Then she says there was \"difficulty\" in the relationship between Simon Patterson and their son. A moment later, the judge suggests that court finish early, partly owing to someone in the court room having a cough, which the judge suggests might distract Dr Rogers. Cross-examination is likely to continue tomorrow. In the meantime, we will be re-capping the key developments from the day, so stay tuned.\\nA dispute over school feespublished at 07:05 British Summer Time07:05 BSTpublished at 06:0506:05\\nDr Rogers is talking about disagreements between Ms Patterson and her estranged husband Simon over child support payments and school fees. She is referring to messages sent to Don and Gail Patterson, asking if Erin Patterson at one point let Don and Gail know that school fees were in dispute, Dr Rogers asks. Erin Patterson she agrees that she said in a messge to Don and Gail that Simon\\'s refusing to pay school fees was a \"punishment\" for Erin Patterson claiming child support. She says she did this because she felt that if Don and Gail knew how Simon was behaving, they might encourage him to \"change his behaviour\".\\nQuestioning moves to Simon Patterson\\'s \\'single\\' tax statuspublished at 06:59 British Summer Time06:59 BSTpublished at 05:5905:59\\nMs Patterson is now being asked about her husband\\'s tax status, specifically, when he changed his marital status to \"single\" on his tax return.

I’m not sure.\"It is alleged she used the fake cancer diagnosis as an excuse to get people to her house for the meal – though Patterson is adamant she never claimed to have had a diagnosis.Dr Rogers takes Ms Patterson back to parts of her testimony earlier this week. She quotes Ms Patterson:\"I\\'m not proud of this, but I led them to believe I might be needing some treatment in regards to [ovarian cancer] in the next few weeks or months.\"Ms Patterson agrees she said this.\\nFast-paced day in courtpublished at 06:31 British Summer Time06:31 BSTpublished at 05:3105:31Katy Watsonreporting from Morwell\\nThe first few days Erin Patterson was in the witness box, she was being questioned by her lawyer – given time to explain what happened at that meal in 2023 and in the days afterwards. But that has dramatically changed today. The prosecutor Nanette Rogers is firing questions at Ms Patterson rapidly, switching between bits of evidence and making accusations that she deliberately poisoned her relatives and lied about health concerns to lure them to her lunch of death-cap-mushroom-laced beef Wellington.Erin Patterson is denying all accusations – on occasion she asks the prosecutor to repeat the question and takes her times before replying.\\nMs Patterson denies telling lunch guests she had cancerpublished at 06:24 British Summer Time06:24 BSTpublished at 05:2405:24Helen SullivanLive editor\\nQuestioning is now turning to what Ms Patterson said at the lunch.\"Did you tell people at the lunch you had cancer?\" Dr Rogers says. \"No,\" says Ms Patterson. Ian Wilkinson, the sole surviving guest, told the court that Ms Patterson had revealed she had cancer and talked about a \"diagnostic test\".He said she had been anxious about telling her children about what he described as a \"threat to her life\". Ms Patterson says she did not ask the guests about whether to tell children about a \"threat to her life\", and says she did not say she had cancer. She did say she told them she had been doing some testing.Dr Rogers takes her to a passage from Mr Wilkinson\\'s testimony where he said Ms Patterson talked about a scan that showed a spot that could be a tumour.Ms Patterson denies this happened. Dr Rogers again asks whether Ms Patterson told her lunch guests she had cancer, and she again denies this.\\n\\'A bit to digest\\' from fictional medical appointment, Ms Patterson wrotepublished at 06:15 British Summer Time06:15 BSTpublished at 05:1505:15James ChaterLive reporter\\nThe prosecution is reading a message from Ms Patterson sent to Gail Patterson, her mother-in-law, in response to a text asking how a biopsy appointment had gone.In it, Ms Patterson says there is a \"bit to digest\" from the appointment, which Ms Patterson has acknowledged was a lie. There was no appointment, and no medical information to digest.\"I might talk about it with you both when I see you in person,\" the message to Gail continued.Dr Rogers asks: \"In this message you purported to carry on the fiction that you had a very serious illness?\"\"Yeah that’s fair,\" Ms Patterson says.The prosecution continues that soon after this message was sent, Ms Patterson invited the family members to the fatal lunch.\\n\\'I didn\\'t give them any reason... I just invited them\\'published at 06:03 British Summer Time06:03 BSTpublished at 05:0305:03\\nMs Patterson is answering questions about what the prosecution calls her \"so-called cancer diagnosis\".She has previously agreed that she lied about having cancer.The prosecution is saying that research Ms Patterson conducted on ovarian and brain cancer would have allowed her to \"tell a more convincing lie about having cancer\".“I mean, theoretically that’s true, but that’s not what I did,” she replies. She said she\\'d researched those conditions because she thought she may have them.When Ms Patterson invited her guests to lunch, the prosecution says, she \"pretended\" she had \"a legitimate reason to speak with them\".\"I didn’t give them any reason when I invited them, I just invited them,\" Ms Patterson said.The court has previously heard the guests believed they were invited to her house to discuss a health issue.\\nMs Patterson was \\'mocking\\' religious advice, prosecution allegespublished at 05:47 British Summer Time05:47 BSTpublished at 04:4704:47James ChaterLive reporter\\nThis emoji chat follows questions about whether Ms Patterson said on a Facebook group that she was an atheist. Ms Patterson denied doing this, and has told the court she is a Christian.The prosecution is alleging that, when using the emojis in these messages, Ms Patterson was reacting to advice from her in-laws to pray.\"I suggest that you were mocking their advice to you,\" the prosecution says. \"Part of your mockery was the religious component of the\\nadvice.\"Ms Patterson denies the accusation, saying she was \"not mocking\" the suggestion of praying, she was just \"frustrated\" it was being offered as the only solution to the issues being discussed.\\nDiscussion turns to emojispublished at 05:45 British Summer Time05:45 BSTpublished at 04:4504:45Helen SullivanLive editor\\nToday has involved in-depth discussions of food dehydrators, kitchen scales, and now... emojis. Dr Rogers accuses Ms Patterson of using \"eye-roll\" emojis in response to suggestions from Don Patterson that the family pray. Dr Rogers says that Ms Patterson used eye-roll emojis with messages she sent to a Facebook group of friends about Don\\'s suggestions. She shows Ms Patterson the emojis in question, and Ms Patterson argues that the emoji in at least one of the messages is a face with a straight line for a mouth – but not an eye-rolling emoji. She\\'s asked to explain what she meant when using them. Dr Rogers then suggests Ms Patterson was responding with mockery, by using the emojis. Ms Patterson replies that she was frustrated, not mocking.\\nCourt debating the definition of \\'mushrooming\\'published at 05:31 British Summer Time05:31 BSTpublished at 04:3104:31\\nWe\\'ve hearing a bit of a back and forth about what \"mushrooming\" means.The court has heard a doctor asked Ms Patterson if she had been mushrooming in the days after the lunch, but Ms Patterson says she doesn\\'t recall that and also isn\\'t precisely sure what the doctor would have meant by that question.What do you think mushrooming means, the prosecution asks her.You might use it in regard to foraging, but might also use it in regard to \"other uses of mushrooms that are not eating\", says Ms Patterson.\\nWe\\'re backpublished at 05:18 British Summer Time05:18 BSTpublished at 04:1804:18\\nCourt proceedings have resumed with the accused, Erin Patterson, still on the stand.This afternoon, she\\'ll face more question from the prosecution, led by Nannette Rogers SC.\\nA reminder of who is whopublished at 05:04 British Summer Time05:04 BSTpublished at 04:0404:04\\nHere\\'s a reminder of who attended the fatal lunch, who died afterwards, and how they are related to Erin Patterson. Don Patterson, Gail Patterson and Heather Wilkinson are the deceased. Ian Wilkinson attended the lunch, but survived after being in an induced coma for weeks.\\nHow will the jury make its decision?published at 04:51 British Summer Time04:51 BSTpublished at 03:5103:51Helen SullivanLive editor\\nFifteen jurors - three more than usual - were selected for the trial, which began about six weeks ago. But a male juror was discharged after the judge found there was a \"reasonable possibility\" he had discussed the case with family and friends. There are now 14 jurors.But only 12 will deliberate over the verdict. After the court has heard all the evidence, that dozen will be randomly selected and the other two people sent home. At the opening of the trial back at the end of April, Justice Christopher Beale explained that when the jurors start their deliberations, they will be sequestered to protect the jury \"from any interference or outside pressure\" and to \"safeguard the integrity of their verdicts\".This means that once the jury has heard the closing speeches and final directions from Justice Beale, they will be bussed to a hotel at an undisclosed location, where they will stay overnight, before being bussed back to the court the next morning to continue deliberations.At the moment, the jury is able to go

chef Erin\\xa0 Patterson\\'s murder trial at Latrobe Valley Magistrates\\' Court in Morwell, Victoria.\\n06:25Patterson denied being upset with Simon over tax return status changeDr Rogers asked Patterson about her marriage with Simon and the issues which arose in late-2022 after her estranged husband listed himself as single on a tax return.Patterson denied she was \\'upset\\' about the issue and she didn\\'t believe Simon offered to change his status on the tax return.Dr Rogers said in Simon\\'s evidence, he said there was a \\'substantial change\\' in the relationship.Patterson said she hoped if Don and Gail knew about Simon he might change his behaviour.More text messages between Erin and Don regarding her issues with Simon were read to the court.Some of the issues pertained to Simon paying school fees.Patterson said she was encouraging Don and Gail to get Simon to \\'do the right thing by his children\\'.\\'I\\'m finding it hard to explain what I meant by that,\\' Patterson said.The trial has concluded for the day and Daily Mail Australia\\'s coverage will resume at 8am local time on Friday.06:04Patterson \\'lied because she thought all her lunch guests would die\\', prosecution allegesDr Rogers has suggested Patterson lied about not telling her lunch guests she had cancer because she thought they were all going to die.The prosecutor suggested Patterson\\'s claim to various people that she had cancer was \\'deliberately false\\'.\\'I didn\\'t make that claim,\\' Patterson said.Dr Rogers said Patterson made the cancer claim to get them to the lunch.\\'That\\'s incorrect,\\' Patterson said.Dr Rogers suggested it was a \\'good reason to get them to lunch because [it was] so out of the ordinary\\'.\\'I disagree,\\' Patterson said.Patterson admitted it \\'wasn\\'t out of the ordinary to have people over for lunch\\'.\\'I suggest that you never thought you would have to account for this lie of having cancer, because you thought that the lunch guests would die and your lie would never be found out,\\' Dr Rogers said.\\'No,\\' Patterson responded.05:56Patterson claims child protection officer\\'s evidence was \\'wrong\\'Dr Rogers asked Patterson if she remembers telling child protection officer Katrina Cripps (pictured) on August 1 that she said she invited Don, Gail, Ian and Heather to lunch to discuss a medical issue.\\'I wouldn\\'t have put it like that because that wasn\\'t the reason I invited people,\\' she said.Patterson then said Ms Cripps’ evidence was \\'wrong\\'.Dr Rogers reminded Patterson of Ms Cripps\\' evidence about when she asked the child protection officer for advice on how to approach this issue with the kids.Patterson said her memory of the conversation was \\'clearly different\\'.05:53Patterson grilled over claims she told guests about \\'chemo\\'Dr Rogers has continued pressing Patterson on what she said about her fictitious cancer diagnosis.\\'Do you agree, you told the lunch guests that you had upcoming treatment for cancer?\\' Dr Rogers said.\\'I can\\'t remember the exact words… I was really trying to communicate I might be needing some treatment,\\' Patterson replied.\\'You wanted your lunch guests to believe you may be having treatment,\\' Dr Rogers said.\\'I agree with that,\\' Patterson said.Patterson again disagreed she told her guest she had cancer.Dr Rogers suggested she told her guests she had ovarian cancer and required treatment including chemotherapy.\\'I don\\'t think I put it like that precisely, I don\\'t remember saying I had a diagnosis…,\\' Patterson said.\\'There was nothing to tell the kids and I had no intention of telling the kids.\\'Dr Rogers brought up the evidence where Simon said he was made aware Patterson said she required \\'chemo\\'.05:31Patterson denies telling lunch guests she had cancerDr Rogers has insisted Patterson told her lunch guests she had cancer but the accused killer denied those claims.Patterson claimed she told guests she didn\\'t want to tell the kids about her illness and she didn\\'t ask for advice on how to tell the kids.\\'I did not,\\' Patterson said when asked if she told her guests she had cancer.Dr Rogers reminded Patterson that Ian Wilkinson (pictured) had talked about a diagnostic test.\\'I think I talked about that I\\'d been undergoing some testing,\\' she said.Dr Rogers said when Mr Wilkinson gave evidence earlier on in the trial, he had said Patterson said she had a spot on a scan that was a tumour.\\'I don\\'t believe I said that, I don\\'t think so no,\\' Patterson said.Dr Rogers insisted Patterson said she had cancer.\\'I disagree,\\' Patterson responded.05:28Prosecution alleges Patterson lied about cancer to ensure Simon attended lunchDr Rogers has suggested Patterson told Gail she needed a biopsy in a bid to ensure Simon came to the July 29 lunch.Patterson is reminded of a message she sent to Gail in which she said she took her daughter to see The Little Mermaid.Patterson also communicated to Gail she had to have a needle biopsy and an MRI.The jury heard Patterson admitted it was a lie.\\'I didn\\'t have an appointment and I didn\\'t have a needle biopsy or a lump,\\' she said.Dr Rogers asked Patterson if she expected Gail to tell Simon about her biopsy stuff.\\'I don\\'t think I wished that, no,\\' Patterson said.Dr Rogers suggested Patterson hoped Gail would tell Simon about the biopsy so he would not decline any future lunch invites.\\'The answer to that is no because I wouldn\\'t expect her to tell him any of that,’ she said.05:14Prosecution claim Patterson wanted to \\'plant a seed\\' of serious health concerns Patterson has admitted lying about a story she concocted that she had to go to hospital to have a lump on her elbow checked out.Dr Rogers suggested Patterson had no appointment at St Vincent\\'s Hospital and no appointment for a needle biopsy.Patterson agreed she had no medical issues to discuss with Gail at the lunch.\\'I didn\\'t have a legitimate medical reason, so, that\\'s true,\\' Patterson said.\\'You had nothing to tell the kids about medical issues,\\' Dr Rogers asked.\\'No,\\' Patterson said.Dr Rogers previously suggested Patterson told Gail about the elbow lump to \\'plant a seed of a serious health issue\\'.\\'No, I don\\'t think that\\'s right, no,\\' Patterson said.\\'Why did you say it?\\' Dr Rogers asked.\\'So I think I gave this in evidence a couple days ago, I initially thought I had an issue with my elbow…\\' Patterson said.\\'I had told Don and Gail what I was worried about, it started to resolve.\\'I probably whinged a bit too much about it to Don and Gail and felt a bit embarrassed about it, and they made me feel loved and cared for in the way they asked about my health and I didn\\'t want that to stop so I just kept going.\\'05:05Prosecution allege Patterson looked up cancer information \\'to lie\\'Dr Rogers has suggested Patterson made internet searches for information that would allow her to \\'tell a more convincing lie about having cancer\\'.The prosecutor used evidence from Victoria Police Cybercrime investigator Shamen Fox-Henry (pictured).The court heard Mr Fox-Henry allegedly found screenshots of cancer searches within a Google Photos app found on a device seized from Patterson\\'s phone.Patterson denied Dr Rogers\\' suggestion, telling the jury she feared she was sick.Dr Rogers repeated her suggestion Patterson was looking up information to lie.\\'I mean theoretically that\\'s true but that\\'s not what I did,\\' she said.Dr Rogers suggested she \\'did so to fool her in-laws\\'.\\'That was not why I did it...,\\' Patterson said.\\'I was concerned that I had ovarian cancer. I was concerned I had something wrong with my brain.\\'I didn\\'t give them any reason when I invited them. I just invited them.\\'04:56Patterson denies she mocked Don and GailDr Rogers said Patterson \\'expressed her true feelings\\' about Don and Gail (pictured) in Facebook messages.Dr Rogers asked Patterson about her use of \\'eye rolling emojis\\' and suggested she used those emojis in response to a family suggestion she \\'pray\\' to solve issues with Simon.The emoji was contained within the \\'I swear to f***ing god\\' message previously read out in court multiple times.Patterson told the jury the emoji looked to be a face with a straight line as a mouth and not rolling eyes.However, Patterson couldn\\'t explain what that emoji meant.\\'All I can say about it, is it\\'s a face with a straight line for a mouth, I don\\'t know what you\\'d call it,\\' she said.Dr Rogers suggested Patterson was mocking Don and Gail\\'s advice.\\'No, that\\'s not true,\\' she said.Dr Rogers also suggested Patterson had mocked their religion.\\'I wasn\\'t mocking, I was frustrated,\\' Patterson said.04:54Patterson denies telling Facebook friends she\\'s an atheist Dr Rogers asked Patterson if she was close to her Facebook friends.\\'Depends who we\\'re talking about,\\' Patterson said.Dr Rogers mentioned Patterson\\'s Facebook friend Christine Hunt, who she said she wasn\\'t close to.Patterson denied inviting Ms Hunt into a smaller chat group.Dr Rogers suggested Patterson \\'felt she could share things with them\\', including Ms Hunt.Patterson said she shared personal things but not in the group chat with Ms Hunt, and claimed she didn\\'t share anything after about 2021.Patterson also denied telling her friends she was an atheistDr Rogers said that\\'s an \\'untruth\\'.\\'No I didn\\'t say that,\\' Patterson said.\\'I didn\\'t post that in the Facebook group.\\'04:37Patterson declares her innocenceDr Rogers also suggested Patterson had lied about not \\'mushrooming\\' to Professor Stuart after knowing for 24 hours Don and Gail had been in hospital.\\'I don\\'t recall her asking me that, but if she did … I would have asked about what she meant by that (mushrooming) first,\\' she said.Dr Rogers then asked Patterson if she knows what mushrooming is.\\'It\\'s not a phrase that I would have used,\\' she said.\\'I would have used foraging if I meant picking.\\'Patterson said she found out Ian and Heather (pictured) were sick on Monday morning \\'indirectly\\'.The jury heard Dr Christopher Webster told her everyone else who ate the lunch had become unwell.Dr Rogers suggested Patterson deliberately used foraged mushrooms in the beef Wellington.\\'No that\\'s not true,\\' Patterson responded.\\'Death caps,\\' Dr Rogers said\\'I didn\\'t deliberately put death cap mushrooms in the meal,\\' she said.Patterson also said she doesn\\'t remember saying she panicked when guests became sick.\\'I don\\'t remember saying that,\\' she said.04:31Patterson grilled about when she knew her lunch guests were sickPatterson said Simon called her on July 30 at 11.08am and 2.23pm.Dr Rogers suggested Simon said he spoke to Patterson on the phone and told her that Don, Gail, Ian and Heather had been \\'crook\\' and were in hospital.\\'He only told me about Don and Gail on the Sunday,\\' she said.\\'You knew two lunch guests were sick on July 30 before you went to hospital the next day,\\' Dr Rogers asked.\\'Correct,\\' Patterson said.04:28Patterson \\'can\\'t remember\\' Health Department asking if she foraged mushroomsDr Rogers brought Patterson back to the evidence of Health Department officer Sally Ann Atkinson (pictured).Patterson agreed she spoke to Ms Atkinson on the phone on August 2 while she was with child protection officer Katrina Cripps.Ms Atkinson previously told the jury Patterson had confirmed she purchased the pre-sliced button mushrooms from Woolworths.\\'I did ask her if she had foraged for mushrooms and picked them herself,\\' Dr Rogers said Ms Atkinson had told the court.\\'I do recall that evidence, I don\\'t remember her asking me that question (about foraging) in the conversation and if I did… I would\\'ve said no,\\' Patterson responded.03:19Prosecutor suggests Patterson \\'lied\\' to doctorPatterson also couldn\\'t recall all of a conversation she had with Monash Health doctor Professor Rhonda Stuart a few days after the lunch.Dr Rogers suggested Professor Stuart said Patterson told her she\\'d only used Woolworths and Asian-type mushrooms in the dish.Professor Stuart said Patterson denied using any other mushrooms but accepted she\\'d been asked about \\'mushrooming\\'.Dr Rogers suggested Patterson said \\'no\\' to going mushrooming.\\'I don\\'t remember that conversation,\\' she saidDr Rogers suggested Patterson lied to Professor Stuart.\\'What I remember of all the questions being asked … was in the context of what was in the meal,\\' Patterson said.The trial has taken a break and will resume at 2.15pm.02:57Patterson denies telling online friends she was an atheist Dr Rogers suggested Patterson told her online friends about her personal life but said she denied telling them she was an atheist.Patterson also denied she told her friends she didn’t want her kids at a Christian school.Dr Rogers asked Patterson if she agrees she never told friends she\\'d foraged.\\'I don\\'t know if I did or I didn\\'t,\\' Patterson said.Dr Rogers suggested Patterson said \\'she didn\\'t\\'.\\'I don\\'t know if I told them or not,\\' she said.02:51Patterson intended to serve Simon beef WellingtonPatterson asked Dr Rogers to stop and move her microphone because she \\'lip reads a little bit\\' and she could not see the prosecutor\\'s face.Dr Rogers suggested Patterson intended to serve one beef wellington to Simon (pictured) had he turned up to the lunch.\\'If he\\'d come, I would have given him a beef Wellington too,\\' Patterson said.\\'But not one with death cap mushrooms in it intentionally.\\'02:46Patterson admits lying to policeDr Rogers suggested to Patterson she lied because if she told the truth she\\'d be \\'implicated in the poison lunch\\'.\\'I agree that I lied because I was afraid I would be held responsible,\\' Patterson said.\\'You knew that if you told police the truth then you would be immediately suspected by police of being involved in a poisoning event,\\' Dr Rogers suggested.\\'That\\'s probably true yes,\\' she said.02:46Prosecution claim Patterson weighed death capsDr Rogers (pictured left) mentioned a photo which Dr May confidently said depicted death cap mushrooms.\\'I don\\'t think they are,\\' Patterson responded.Dr Rogers also suggested Patterson saw an iNaturalist post of a death cap sighting at Loch made by Christine Mckenzie on April 18, 2023.\\'I disagree,\\' Patterson said.\\'I suggest you then went to Loch on April 28,\\' Dr Rogers said.\\'I don\\'t know if I did go to Loch on that day or not,\\' Patterson responded.\\'I suggest you went to Loch on that day to find death cap mushrooms,\\' Dr Rogers said.\\'I disagree,\\' Patterson said.Dr Rogers then showed Patterson a photo she suggested were death cap mushrooms picked from Loch.The Crown prosecutor also suggested Patterson weighed death cap mushrooms to \\'calculate the weight to administer the fatal dose required for one person\\'.Dr Rogers also suggested Patterson weighed death caps to calculate how much was needed to kill five people.Patterson said she disagreed.02:18Judge gives update on how long is left in trialJustice Christopher Beale has told the jury it\\'s likely Patterson will be in the witness box all week and possibly next week too.Justice Beale said once evidence is completed, he will have legal discussions with the parties while the jury is out.\\'Those discussions will include talk about if any more evidence is required and what direction he needs to give the jury regarded to law,\\' he said.Justice Beale said after all the evidence is completed closing addresses would commence.He predicted next week will be full due to the public holiday and the week after Justice Beale said there may be more evidence before closings.\\'Which could each take a couple of days and take up that week,\\' he said.\\'And then the jury needs to deliberate.\\'How long is a piece of string, you take all the time you need.\\'02:13Patterson denied she took photo of death capsDr Rogers has shown Patterson (pictured) several photos which had previously been exhibited.These photos depicted mushrooms and another showed a set of scales next to a dehydrator tray.Dr Rogers also showed a separate police search photo of a set of scales.Patterson agreed the scales in both photos were the same.Patterson was also asked to clarify if two images depicting mushrooms were different mushrooms.The accused killer agreed the mushrooms were different.An image also depicted mushrooms on a set of scales with the weight being 255mg.Dr Rogers showed Patterson another image of mushrooms.Dr Rogers said expert witness Dr Tom May said the mushrooms depicted in the image looked like death caps \\'at a high level of confidence\\'.\\'I suggest to you that these are death cap mushrooms which you foraged,\\' Dr Rogers said.\\'That\\'s not correct,\\' Erin said.Dr Rogers suggested Patterson foraged for death cap mushrooms in Loch after a death cap sighting was posted on plant identification website iNaturalist.01:57Patterson accused of practicing how to hide mushrooms in foodDr Rogers suggested Patterson dried and turned mushrooms into powder so she could test how to secretly put them in meals.Patterson claimed she used other foods in the dehydrator.\\'I can\\'t be specific about that but I was not just dehydrating mushrooms,\\' she said.Patterson claimed she tried to dry \\'apples, banana, quite a lot of different types of fruit\\'.Dr Rogers put it to Patterson that she only ever used the dehydrator to dry mushrooms but Patterson disagreed.Patterson admitted she secretly put dried and powered mushrooms in muffins, spaghetti, stew and brownies.\\'I was trying to get different types of vegetables into my children\\'s bodies,\\' Patterson said.01:51Patterson told she lied because she \\'deliberately poisoned lunch guests\\'Dr Rogers (pictured) suggested Patterson performed a factory reset on Phone B prior to dumping the dehydrator at the Koonwarra Transfer Station.The prosecutor is pressing Patterson to identify whether an image of a dehydrator seized from the tip is hers.\\'I presume this is the one I put in [the tip],\\' Patterson said.Dr Rogers suggested Patterson rushed from hospital to dump the dehydrator because she was aware she had dried death cap mushrooms in it.\\'I didn\\'t know that [death cap mushrooms were in the dehydrator],\\' Patterson said.\\'You knew they were death cap mushrooms,\\' Dr Rogers said.\\'You were pretty keen to get rid of any evidence, you lied to police, because you knew if you told police the truth it would implicate you in deliberately poisoning your lunch guests.\\'\\'No,\\' Patterson responded.01:41Crown commences cross-examining PattersonCrown prosecutor Dr Nanette Rogers has commenced cross-examining Patterson.Patterson agreed she bought the dehydrator from Hartly Wells - Betta Electrical in Leongatha.01:37Patterson sobs while denying intending to kill guestsPatterson has teared up when she was asked if she intended to kill or harm Don and Gail Patterson, and Ian (pictured) and Heather Wilkinson.Mr Mandy asked Patterson the questions about each individual and she responded \\'no\\' to each question while sobbing.Patterson also denied deliberately picking death cap mushrooms.01:34Patterson pleads her innocencePatterson also said she lied to police about foraging for mushrooms.\\'They were both lies,\\' she said.Mr Mandy asked Patterson if she lied when she said she only cooked one batch of beef Wellingtons.\\'No I did not lie,\\' Patterson said.\\'Were they all the same?\\' Mr Mandy asked.\\'Yes,\\' Patterson responded.\\'Did you lie about the Asian grocer purchase?\\' Mr Mandy asked.\\'No,\\' Patterson responded.\\'Did you lie about using those mushrooms in the Wellingtons?\\' Mr Mandy asked.\\'No I didn\\'t,\\' Patterson responded.\\'Did you lie about the kids eating them?\\' Mr Mandy asked.\\'No I didn\\'t,\\' Patterson responded.\\'Did you pretend to be sick?\\' Mr Mandy asked.\\'No I didn\\'t,\\' Patterson said.\\'On leaving hospital did you think anyone ate death caps?\\' Mr Mandy asked.\\'No I didn\\'t,\\' Patterson responded.\\'Were you reluctant to get treatment on July 31?\\' Mr Mandy asked.\\'On the first visit but not the second,\\' Patterson said.\\'The children?\\' Mr Mandy asked.\\'Initially I was reluctant, but once they explained to me the concern I wanted them to come in,\\' Patterson said.The trial was briefly paused.01:22Patterson lied about owning a dehydratorMr Mandy (pictured left) asked Patterson about the dehydrator.Patterson said the dehydrator was the same one she took photos of and shared images with online friends.Mr Mandy asked if Patterson lied to police about the dehydrator.\\'It was (a lie),\\' she said.Mr Mandy repeated some dialogue from the police interview:\\'Do you know anything about a dehydrator in your house?\\' Mr Mandy said.\\'Answer was \"no\".\\'Patterson responded: \\'Yes [those were lies]\\'.\\'Well I had disposed of it a few days earlier in the context of thinking maybe mushrooms that I\\'d foraged for the meal I\\'d prepared were responsible for making people sick,\\' she said.\\'It was this stupid knee jerk reaction, but I was just scared and shouldn\\'t have done it.\\'01:16Patterson reveals why she used her phone during police searchDefence barrister Colin Mandy SC asked Patterson about the use of her phone during the August 5 police search.\\'So the general principal was that it had to be out on the table in front of where I was sitting,\\' she said.\\'I couldn\\'t just be playing with it generally.\\'Patterson said she wanted to clarify if her daughter had a ballet lesson and asked police if she could text a ballet mum.Patterson said she was granted access to the phone.\\'[That was] quite early in the search, maybe an hour or so in,\\' she said.01:14Patterson assumes condition of Don and GailErin Patterson, who returned to the witness box wearing a paisley muumuu, agreed Simon told her on the Sunday that Don and Gail (pictured) were in Korumburra hospital on fluids.Patterson said she learned the pair were moved to Dandenong hospital on Monday and on Tuesday afternoon, Patterson said she learned the couple were then moved to the Austin ICU.\\'It was clear to me there had been a progression of symptoms, it seemed likely to me they were getting sicker,\\' Patterson said.00:40Trial delayed due to power outage The commencement of today\\'s murder trial session has been delayed due to an apparent power outage in parts of Morwell.Proceedings were due to start at 10.30am.Erin Patterson\\'s defence barrister, Colin Mandy SC, is pictured entering the court this morning.22:21Patterson admitted lying to family about cancer Patterson on Wednesday told the jury she spoke about her health with her lunch guests \\'right at the end of the meal\\'.\\'I mentioned I had an issue a year or two earlier where I feared I had ovarian cancer,\\' she said.\\'I\\'m not proud of this but I led them to believe that I might need some treatment for that over the next weeks and months, I did (mislead them).\\'They all showed a lot of compassion about that and then we saw Simon\\'s car driving into the driveway, so Ian said why don\\'t we pray for Erin and that\\'s what we did.\\'Patterson said she was embarrassed and ashamed that she didn\\'t have control over her body or what she ate.\\'I lied, I was ashamed, I was embarrassed, I shouldn\\'t have lied to them,\\' she said tearfully.22:21Why \\'frantic\\' Patterson dumped the dehydratorOn Wednesday, Patterson said the conversation with Simon made her think about all the times she had used the dehydrator and dried foraged mushrooms with it weeks earlier.\\'What if they got in the container with the Chinese mushrooms,\\' she said.\\'Maybe that had happened, I was thinking maybe that\\'s how this all…\\'Patterson said after she dumped the dehydrator at the tip she felt \\'scared and responsible\\'.\\'I just felt really scared,\\' she said.\\'I was frantic, people had got sick.\\'Patterson said she got the dehydrator and then drove to the Koonwarra Transfer Station tip (pictured).The jury heard the dehydrator was located and seized by police.Debris found within the appliance tested postive for death cap mushrooms.22:13Patterson sobs over Simon\\'s questionOn Wednesday, Patterson told the jury she spoke to estranged husband Simon Patterson (pictured) on August 2.She said she had a conversation with the kids about why they were at the hospital, and why everyone else was unwell.Patterson said there was concerns her lunch had made people unwell.Patterson explained how she had previously used a dehydrator to dry mushrooms.\\'(Simon) said to me \"is that how you poisoned my parents using that dehydrator?\"\\' Patterson said while sobbing in court.\\'I said \"of course not\".\\'21:54Erin Patterson to enter witness box for fourth straight day - as crowds line up outside courtErin Patterson (pictured) will resume giving evidence in her murder trial shortly after today\\'s proceedings kick off at 10.30am.Lead defence barrister Colin Mandy SC is expected to finish questioning his client before the prosecution lead by Dr Nanette Rogers SC (pictured in yellow scarf) will have an opportunity to cross-examine the accused killer.Patterson in the witness box has been a big-ticket item as far as members of the public are concerned.A crowd (pictured) started to gather outside Morwell Court, a small regional courthouse about two hours east of Melbourne, from 7am with people eager to see Patterson give evidence.The trial is sitting at the Supreme Court at Latrobe Valley Law Courts instead of the main supreme court in Victoria.

Earlier on Wednesday, the White House threatened to strip Columbia University of its accreditation over claims it violated the civil rights of its Jewish students.\\n```\\n\\n## [Trump moves to deny visas to Harvard\\'s international students](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-harvard-visas-rcna211079) (#103609)\\n\\n> 2025-06-05 01:40:11+00:00\\n\\n```\\nPresident Donald Trump said Wednesday that he will deny visas for foreign students trying to come to the United States to attend Harvard University, his latest attack on the prominent Ivy League college.The administration tried late last month to revoke Harvard’s ability to enroll foreign students — a move that was swiftly blocked by a federal judge.In a proclamation Wednesday, Trump said Harvard failed to present sufficient information about its foreign students to the federal government.“Harvard provided data on misconduct by only three students, and the data it provided was so deficient that the DHS could not evaluate whether it should take further actions,” Trump said, referring to the Department of Homeland Security.Harvard said it would fight to protect its international students. \"This is yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard’s First Amendment rights,\" a spokesperson for the university said Wednesday night. Trump made his pledge as he announced what amounts to a travel ban for 12 countries and limitations on seven others.The proclamation said the president would “restrict the entry of foreign nationals who seek to enter the United States solely or principally to participate in a course of study at Harvard University or in an exchange visitor program hosted by Harvard University.”It added that the State Department would review existing foreign students under F, M or J visas to see whether their visas should be revoked.Trump and his administration have attacked Harvard, saying it has not done enough to combat antisemitism on campus during demonstrations against the Israel-Hamas war.Harvard in April rejected Trump administration demands that included auditing viewpoints of the student body. In response, the federal government said it was freezing more than $2 billion in federal grants.The administration previously sought to limit Harvard\\'s ability to enroll foreign students by revoking its certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, Harvard said. The government also sought to prohibit Harvard from sponsoring F and J visas.Harvard President Alan M. Garber responded in a letter on May 23 that Harvard was being retaliated against for refusing to surrender to the Trump administration\\'s illegal attempts to control it and its students.\"We condemn this unlawful and unwarranted action,\" Garber said. \"It imperils the futures of thousands of students and scholars across Harvard and serves as a warning to countless others at colleges and universities throughout the country who have come to America to pursue their education and fulfill their dreams.\"Phil HelselPhil Helsel is a reporter for NBC News.\\n```\\n\\n## [Can the US afford to lose its 1.1 million international students?](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/5/can-the-us-afford-to-lose-its-1-1-million-international-students?traffic_source=rss) (#103640)\\n\\n> 2025-06-05 06:09:06+00:00\\n\\n```\\nKhadija Mahmoud* is pulling an all-nighter, filled with caffeine and surviving on adrenalin to pack up her belongings so she can catch the train in the morning from Washington, DC to New York City for her summer internship.\\nMahmoud is a 21-year old international student who has just finished her junior year at Georgetown University. She is anxious and worried after her immigration lawyer advised against leaving the country for the summer due to the recent border control policies for international students.\\nOn 27 May, the State Department instructed United States embassies around the world to temporarily pause scheduling new student visa appointments, as the Trump administration seeks to expand social media screenings for applicants, the latest in a string of restrictions targeting international students.\\n“It’s been very turbulent, and equally terrifying with each development that comes,” Mahmoud told Al Jazeera, speaking from her college dormitory in Washington, DC.\\nMahmoud isn’t alone in feeling this way. Many other international students say they feel they need to stay under the radar, afraid that even a small issue could get them deported.\\n1.1 million international students\\nAccording to NAFSA, a US nonprofit organisation that focuses on international education and student exchange, over the 2023/2024 academic year there were just more than 1.1 million international students studying in the US.\\nThese international students made up 5.6 percent of the nearly 19 million total higher education students across the US.\\nTogether, students from India and China made up 54 percent of the total, with India leading at 331,602 (29 percent) and China at 277,398 (25 percent).\\n‘Major loss for the United States’\\nFanta Aw, executive director and CEO of NAFSA, who is herself a former international student, says she knows on a personal and professional level how important the cultural exchange between international students and local communities is, especially in today’s hyper connected world.\\n“I think this is a major loss for the United States; other countries will open their doors and they are already welcoming students,” Aw told Al Jazeera.\\n“Students want certainty. They want consistency. And they want to know that the system works. And if they continue to see action after action, they’re already losing trust,” she adds.\\n“Once you continue down this road, you will have years to recover from this, and you may never recover from it. Because by then, more other countries are competing for these same students.”\\n“We’re seeing Germany. We’re seeing Japan. We’re seeing South Korea. Malaysia has always been a destination for students. The Middle East, with all of the American-style universities – this is what the US is competing with.”\\nWhere are international students studying?\\nAlthough many international students are concentrated at major universities on the East and West coasts, a sizeable number also study at prominent universities in the Midwest and other parts of the US.\\nAccording to data compiled by Open Doors, during the 2023/2024 academic year, New York City hosted the largest number of international students, with 27,247 at New York University and 20,321 at Columbia University. Northeastern University in Boston follows, with 21,023 international students.\\nOne such student headed to the Midwest is Noor Ali*, a 23-year-old from Karachi, Pakistan, who is embarking on her masters in journalism on a full scholarship from the university.\\nAli has requested her identity be concealed and her institution not be named for her security. Despite having already received her student visa, she’s still concerned about entering the US.\\n“I got my visa the day that India attacked Pakistan and Pakistan retaliated against India,” she laughs as she explains how she ventured out that day when both nuclear neighbours were engaged in an aerial face-off, far above in the skies.\\n“Miraculously, the appointment did not get cancelled. And I ended up going there for my interview. And I ended up getting the visa, which was like, insane. I didn’t really know how I got it. But I mean, I’ve gotten it now!” Ali beams, her excitement undeniable at her luck.\\nAlthough she had the option to study in Europe, she chose the US because of her familiarity with the country through movies and TV shows. Even without having visited, she feels like she understands American life and culture.\\n“These values of American democracy are about American freedom. And, you know, just a lot of focus on ethics and morality, and it used to be known for its academic freedom, and a lot of focus on diversity.”\\nAli’s ideals are not without scepticism or worry. She admits being very scared and has reconsidered her decision several times. Still, she feels encouraged by the pushback the Trump administration’s policies have received lately.\\n“The core of American democracy or ideals of freedom are getting reinforced,” says Ali.\\xa0 She feels strongly that the cultural experience will be worth it for her.\\nCrackdown on pro-Palestine students and staff\\nThe Trump administration’s latest step in its crackdown on US universities has particularly focused on international students who have shown support for Palestinians in Gaza over the past year.\\n“Georgetown has a pretty large international student population compared to other schools in the US, so you’d think that would translate into a lot more advocacy and more grassroots work going on on campus,” Mahmoud goes on to say.\\nStudents march during an on-campus protest in support of Palestine at Georgetown University on September 4, 2024, in Washington, DC [Andrew Harnik/Getty Images]\\nMahmoud feels her college hasn’t been a very vocal campus when it comes to the rights of students, nor in providing a proper safety net for freedom of speech.\\n“I think a massive inflection point on campus was the detention of Dr Badar Suri. I felt the need to have to scrape through my social media, see if I posted anything that could get me flagged,” says Mahmoud.\\nMapheze Saleh, right, wife of arrested and detained Georgetown University scholar Badar Khan Suri, holds a sign calling for her husband’s release after speaking at a news conference following his hearing at Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, on May 1, 2025 [Jacquelyn Martin, AP Photo]\\nDr Badar Khan Suri, a postdoctoral scholar of conflict studies, was arrested on March 17 outside his home in Rosslyn, Virginia and held in immigration detention for two months before being released on May 14, following a federal judge’s order. Suri, whose wife Mapheze Saleh is a US citizen of Palestinian descent, has spoken out against Israel’s war in Gaza.\\nThat particular case became a real turning point on the campus, she says, where a lot of international students had spoken up and taken to social media.\\nHow much money is at stake?\\nAccording to NAFSA, the 1.1 million international students studying in the US contributed $43.8bn to the US economy during the 2023–2024 academic year, creating 378,175 jobs nationwide.\\nThat means that for every three international students enrolled, one US job was created or supported.\\nCalifornia hosted the highest number of international students, with 140,858 contributing $6.4bn to the state’s economy and supporting 55,114 jobs. New York followed with 135,813 students, generating $6.3bn and creating 51,719 jobs. Texas came third, with 89,546 international students contributing $2.5bn and supporting 22,112 jobs.\\nIn total, 12 states gained more than $1bn each from the economic contributions of international students. According to NAFSA, international student spending in these 12 states combined to generate 57 percent of the total dollar contribution to the US economy.\\n“When your enrolment declines, then you’re going to have some economic challenges and that’s going to force institutions to have to make some very difficult decisions and choices,” NAFSA executive director Fanta Aw explains.\\n“The number of high schoolers that are graduating is on the decline in most parts of the country. So it’s not like they can make that up with American domestic students because that’s already on the decline.”\\n“So when you cannot have the level of enrollment at the undergraduate level here in the US and that is then compounded with the decline in international students, that’s a perfect storm.”\\nAw says many international students who return home contribute to their countries, while those who stay in the US contribute through taxes and help boost the overall economy.\\nWhat do international students study?\\nIn the 2023-2024 academic year, among the 1.1 million students, the most popular majors were Math and Computer Science, Engineering, and Business and Management.\\nInternational students enrolled in English language programs contributed $371.3m and supported 2,691 jobs.\\n(Al Jazeera)\\nIn terms of degrees, nearly half (502,000) of all international students were registered for postgraduate programmes, 343,000 in undergraduate programmes, 243,000 in Optional Practical Training (OPT), and 39,000 in non-degree programmes.\\n*Name has been changed to protect anonymity\\n```\\n\\n## [Trump signs proclamation to restrict foreign student visas at Harvard](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/04/trump-restricts-harvard-student-visas) (#103880)\\n\\n> 2025-06-05 04:01:32+00:00\\n\\n```\\nDonald Trump signed a proclamation to restrict foreign student visas at Harvard University, the White House said on Wednesday.The order would suspend for an initial six months the entry into the US of foreign nationals seeking to study or participate in exchange programs at Harvard. Trump declared that it would jeopardize national security to allow Harvard to continue hosting foreign students.The proclamation is the US president’s latest attempt to choke the Ivy League school from an international pipeline that accounts for a quarter of the student body, and a further escalation in the White House’s fight with the institution.“I have determined that the entry of the class of foreign nationals described above is detrimental to the interests of the United States because, in my judgment, Harvard’s conduct has rendered it an unsuitable destination for foreign students and researchers,” Trump wrote in the order.Trump’s proclamation also directs the US state department to consider revoking academic or exchange visas of any current Harvard students who meet his proclamation’s criteria.Harvard in a statement called Trump’s proclamation “yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard’s First Amendment rights.”“Harvard will continue to protect its international students.”Trump singled out Harvard’s connections with China as reason for cutting off the university from foreign students. The proclamation said Harvard was linked to research that “could advance China’s military modernisation”.The statement also said Harvard was considered the top “party school” for Chinese Communist party bureaucrats and noted that the daughter of Xi Jinping, China’s leader, attended in the early 2010s.In the early 2000s, Harvard ran a “China Leaders in Development” programme in conjunction with Tsinghua University in Beijing for Chinese government officials.“I don’t think this is going to benefit US universities at all,” said a Chinese undergraduate student with an offer to study at Harvard on a master’s degree starting next term who asked that his name be withheld. “It’s causing normal people, us students, a lot of anxiety.”The Trump administration has been engaged in a tense standoff with Harvard, the US’s oldest and wealthiest university, freezing billions of dollars in grants and other funding and proposing to end its tax-exempt status, prompting a series of legal challenges.Harvard argues the administration is retaliating against it for refusing to accede to its demands to control the school’s governance, curriculum and the ideology of its faculty and students.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionHarvard sued after the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, on 22 May announced her department was immediately revoking Harvard’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, which allows it to enrol foreign students.Her action was almost immediately temporarily blocked by a Boston court. On the eve of a hearing before her last week, the department changed course and said it would instead challenge Harvard’s certification through a lengthier administrative process.Trump’s order on Wednesday invokes a different legal authority than the earlier move by the Department of Homeland Security. The legal justification for the ban, Trump said, are sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act, “which authorize the President to suspend entry of any class of aliens whose entry would be detrimental to the interests of the United States”.Trump officials have repeatedly raised the stakes and sought new fronts to pressure Harvard, cutting more than $2.6bn in research grants and moving to end all federal contracts with the university. The latest threat has targeted Harvard’s roughly 7,000 international students, who account for half the enrolment at some Harvard graduate schools.“President Trump wants our institutions to have foreign students, but believes that the foreign students should be people that can love our country,” the White House said in a fact sheet about the proclamation.Wednesday’s two-page directive said Harvard had “demonstrated a history of concerning foreign ties and radicalism” and had “extensive entanglements with foreign adversaries” including China.As well as the spat with Harvard, the White House has pledged to “aggressively revoke” visas for Chinese students across the country, especially those with links to the CCP or in “critical fields”.\\n```\\n\\n## [Trump signs order banning citizens of 12 countries from entering the US](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/04/trump-proclamation-travel-ban) (#104049)\\n\\n> 2025-06-05 01:13:20+00:00\\n\\n```\\nDonald Trump has signed a sweeping order banning travel from 12 countries and restricting travel from seven others, reviving and expanding the travel bans from his first term.The nationals of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen will be “fully” restricted from entering the US, according to the proclamation. Meanwhile, the entry of nationals of Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela will be partially restricted.The US president said that he “considered foreign policy, national security, and counterterrorism goals” in deciding the scope of the ban. Trump had cued up the ban in an executive order signed on 20 January, his first day back in the White House, instructing his administration to submit a list of candidates for a ban by 21 March.Trump has cited a range of justifications for the bans, including national security and concerns that visitors from those countries are overstaying their visas.But advocates and experts have said that blanket travel bans discriminate against groups of people based on ethnicity alone. They will likely result – as the travels bans did during Trump’s first term – in the separation of families. The bans on travel from Haiti, Cuba and Venezuela could be especially impactful in US communities with huge immigrant populations from those countries.“This discriminatory policy, which limits legal immigration, not only flies in the face of what our country is supposed to stand for, it will be harmful to our economy and communities that rely on the contributions of people who come to America from this wide range of countries,” said Pramila Jayapal, a Democratic representative of Washington.The decision to ban travel from these countries comes amid a wave of hardline immigration policies that Trump has issued, including the blocking of asylum claims at the southern border and cancelling temporary protected status for immigrants from a number of countries facing deep humanitarian crises. Trump has also signed a proclamation to restrict foreign student visas at Harvard University and ordered US consulates to conduct social media screening of every visa applicant seeking to travel to the university.In a video message released on social media, Trump said he was making good on a promise to act following the recent attack at a Boulder, Colorado, event showing support for Israeli hostages. The attack by an Egyptian national “underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted, as well as those who come here as temporary visitors and overstay their visas. We don’t want them,” he said.Trump added that the list was “subject to revisions based on whether material improvements are made” and that “likewise, new countries could be added as threats emerge around the world”.Having instituted a travel ban on Muslim countries early in his first term, Trump trailed his plans for a new ban during his election campaign against Kamala Harris last year.“I will ban refugee resettlement from terror-infested areas like the Gaza Strip, and we will seal our border and bring back the travel ban,” Trump said in September. “Remember the famous travel ban? We didn’t take people from certain areas of the world. We’re not taking them from infested countries.”skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionProtesters rally against Donald Trump’s earlier travel ban in 2018. Photograph: Mohammed Elshamy/Anadolu via Getty ImagesHe was referring to the ban he imposed after taking office in January 2017, leading to chaos at airports as protesters and civil rights attorneys rushed to help affected travelers.Trump said the ban was needed to combat terrorist threats. It was blocked by federal courts on civil liberties grounds but the US supreme court, to which Trump would eventually appoint three hardline rightwing justices, allowed the ban to stand.The supreme court said Trump’s ban did not target Muslims – despite the fact it originally targeted travelers from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, Muslim-majority countries. According to the court, the ban fell within the remit of a president’s national security powers. North Korea and Venezuela were also included.The Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair) said then: “The Muslim ban’s bigotry should have been as clear to the supreme court as it is to the Muslims demonized by it. Apparently, everyone but the supreme court can see the decision for what it is: an expression of animosity.”In 2020, shortly before the Covid pandemic drastically reduced world travel, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, Myanmar, Tanzania and Sudan were added to the ban.In 2021, that travel ban was among measures Joe Biden ended within hours of being sworn in as Trump’s White House successor.\\n```\\n\\n## [Trump travel ban live updates: Trump bans travel from 12 countries to the US](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVEFVX3lxTE9mWmdZeExEOTdNYjdfU2tyMkFnOUZaVWllOHJvb09hZG41ZWx1ZXZSZ29pSnFfUHpzOF9vUFh0UEZpTV83UEFlNnV0MFJRS2ZWdXBwNQ?oc=5) (#104250)\\n\\n> 2025-06-05 06:03:45+00:00\\n\\n```\\nLive Reporting (active)Watch & listenSummaryDonald Trump has signed a ban on travel to the US from 12 countries, including Afghanistan, Haiti and Iran in a bid to \"protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors\"There are an additional seven countries whose nationals face partial travel restrictions, including Cuba and VenezuelaThere are some exemptions, including athletes travelling for major sporting events, some Afghan nationals and dual nationals with citizenship in unaffected countries\"We don\\'t want them,\" Trump said as he announced the ban, while also citing the Colorado attack on SundayThe proclamation echoes an order from Trump\\'s first term in 2017, when he announced a ban on travel from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the USThe travel ban, which comes into effect on 9 June, fulfils a promise Trump made during his 2024 election campaign, and is likely to draw swift legal challengesMedia caption, Watch: President Trump announces travel ban from \\'high-risk regions\\'Live ReportingEdited by Marita MoloneyLIVE stream page 1China says Harvard order will harm US credibilitypublished at 09:20 British Summer Time09:20 BSTpublished at 08:2008:20\\nImage source, ReutersAfter Donald Trump signed an executive order restricting foreign student visas at Harvard University, China\\'s foreign ministry spokesperson says the country \"opposes politicising education co-operation\".In its fact sheet following the order, the White House claimed Harvard was the top overseas \"overseas party school\" for Chinese Communist Party officials.Speaking to reporters at a regular press briefing, Lin Jian says educational co-operation between the two countries is \"mutually beneficial\" and moves made by the US will \"only harm its own image and international credibility\".Lin adds that China will \"firmly safeguard the legitimate interests of its students and scholars overseas\".Dive deeper: The fallout from Trump\\'s war on Harvard will long outlast his presidency, writes North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher\\nTrump also restricts Harvard visas and orders Biden investigationpublished at 09:06 British Summer Time09:06 BSTpublished at 08:0608:06\\nImage source, ReutersAlong with the announcement on a ban on travel to the United States from 12 countries, plus restrictions on seven more, a few other announcements were made by the US president on Wednesday: Foreign student visas at Harvard suspended Trump has suspended the entry of foreign students seeking to study or participate in exchange programmes at Harvard University for six months.Trump says this is because of national security concerns, Harvard has called the order \"retaliatory\" and emphasised it would continue to protect its international students, according to the Reuters news agency.Joe Biden\\'s actions during his presidency investigated The president has ordered an investigation into his predecessor\\'s actions during his time in the White House, accusing Joe Biden\\'s aides of a \"conspiracy\" to \"deceive the public about Biden\\'s mental state\".

An Egyptian national, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, has been\\ncharged in the attack.Travelling to the US is a \"privilege, not a right\", the congressman responds, claiming Americans have \"had enough of immigrants coming to our country,\\nviolating our laws and committing violence among our people\".He adds that the US is \"not a racist nation\", saying: \"We have the right to control our borders.\"\\nList of countries \\'truly punitive\\', human rights group sayspublished at 07:47 British Summer Time07:47 BSTpublished at 06:4706:47\\n\"This new travel ban mirrors much from the first Trump administration,\" Robyn Barnard from Human Rights First in Washington DC tells Newsday on the BBC World Service. \"There is no clear thread between each,\" she continues. \"The commonalities are that many of these countries are places that people are fleeing due to conflict, violence and restrictive polices against women and girls and LGTBQ individuals and others.\" Barnard goes on to describe Trump\\'s list as \"truly punitive\", saying that the administration is trying to punish countries they don\\'t want migrants from. \"It really feels like it\\'s about punishment and creating more chaos and disfunction in our immigration system,\" she says.\\nHow this differs from Trump\\'s 2017 travel banpublished at 07:31 British Summer Time07:31 BSTpublished at 06:3106:31\\nImage source, Bloomberg via Getty ImagesImage caption, Trump\\'s last travel ban triggered protests across the US in 2017During his first term in the White House, Trump ordered a travel ban against people from seven Muslim-majority countries from coming to the US.Critics called it a \"Muslim ban\", and the order faced several legal challenges.It was amended several times before being upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018. Trump\\'s successor Joe Biden repealed the order in 2021.But this time around it\\'s a savvier version, our North America correspondent Jake Kwon writes.Last time a crucial question in the legal battle over the bill was whether it discriminated against travellers based on their religion.This time, the order doesn\\'t just target majority Muslim nations. Trump says the rationale for the countries chosen is based on visa overstay rates or political instability.There are some similarities in the nations chosen. Iran, Libya and Somalia are among those featuring on both lists.However there is a difference in how long the policy is due to last. Last time it was only 90 to 120 days, but today\\'s has no end date.\\nTrump on banned countries: \\'We don\\'t want them\\'published at 07:14 British Summer Time07:14 BSTpublished at 06:1406:14\\nImage source, ReutersLet\\'s bring you more of what the US president had to say as he announced the travel ban in a video on his Truth Social platform.Donald Trump said a recent attack in Boulder, Colorado - where 12 people were injured when a man attacked a group gathering in support of Israeli hostages - \"underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted as well as those who come here as temporary visitors and overstay their visas\".\"We don\\'t want them,\" Trump said, adding that he believes the US can\\'t have \"open migration from any country where we cannot safely and reliably vet and screen those who seek to enter\".The strength of these new restrictions applied depends on the \"severity of the threat posed,\" Trump continued, adding that the list of countries under the ban is \"subject to revision\" if improvements are made.\\nWhat you need to know about Trump\\'s travel banpublished at 06:59 British Summer Time06:59 BSTpublished at 05:5905:59\\nUS President Donald Trump signed a travel ban order on Wednesday night, barring entry to the US for citizens from a number of countries across the world. Here\\'s what you need to know:Who will be banned from entering the US?From 9 June, citizens from 12 countries - Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen - will be banned from travelling to the US.Those from another seven countries - Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela - will be subject to a partial ban.Is anyone exempt?There are a few exemptions to this new policy - including athletes travelling for major sporting events, some dual nationals and Afghan nationals holding Special Immigrant Visas.The order also says the secretary of state may grant exemptions on a \"case-by-case\" basis.What has Trump said?The US can\\'t have \"open migration from any country where we cannot safely and reliably vet and screen those who seek to enter\", the US president said in a video announcing the ban.\\nMyanmar ban will largely affect people fighting for democracypublished at 06:45 British Summer Time06:45 BSTpublished at 05:4505:45Jonathan HeadSouth East Asia Correspondent\\nImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Many Burmese refugees hope to find a home in the USWhen we look at the nationalities of people who have carried out attacks on the United States, we\\'ll see that many of them are from countries friendly to the US, which have not been subject to a travel ban in this case.Trump says the countries on his list do not have capacity to vet their own citizens. Myanmar is in a state of collapse, so that\\'s quite true. But there hasn\\'t been any record of anyone from the country ever carrying out any kind of attack on the US. It simply isn\\'t a credible threat.In the end, this travel ban applies to a country where huge numbers of its citizens have fled and are living in exile - many of them hoping to find a home in the US. There are already nearly 250,000 Burmese living in the US, and many of them are refugees with a very well-founded fear of persecution. The worst perpetrators of human rights abuses in Myanmar are mostly already banned from travelling to the US. Extending the ban to all citizens will mostly affect those fighting against the military for the restoration of democracy. These include activists living in precarious situations in neighbouring countries where they don\\'t have status - many of them hoping at some point to get to the US.So this is a pretty baffling decision.\\nHaitians will see this as US kicking a nation when it\\'s downpublished at 06:24 British Summer Time06:24 BSTpublished at 05:2405:24Will GrantMexico, Central America and Cuba correspondent\\nFrom the perspective of many Haitians, there will be indignation at this travel ban, coming as it does with the country in the grip of its biggest security crisis in living memory. Under the Biden administration and then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken, there was a tacit recognition that Washington had played a crucial role in hand-picking the current leadership in Haiti and was at least partly responsible for transnational effort to stop Haiti becoming a failed state. That ensured that Haitians in the United States under Temporary Protected Status (TPS) were in no danger of being deported to a nation on its knees. As such, to see Haiti on the travel ban list will be galling for the lucky few with the relevant papers to reach the US. It will feel to many like the definition of kicking a nation when it\\'s down, by one of its supposedly closest partners.\\nWhy these countries?published at 06:07 British Summer Time06:07 BSTpublished at 05:0705:07Kwasi Gyamfi AsieduUS reporter\\nTrump says his travel ban order is partially in response to threats of terrorism.But besides Iran, none of the 12 countries hit by the ban are named on the US government\\'s State Sponsors of Terrorism list.Trump also said some of the countries, such as Libya and Sudan, were put on the list because of the \"competence of the central authority for issuance of passports\". Many of the countries have ongoing armed conflicts. Others were on the list because their governments don\\'t give access to criminal records, he said.The order also says some of the countries have been put on the list because of difficulties US officials have had deporting citizens from those countries back home. Generally, people scheduled to be deported require travel documents from their home countries.With regards to the partial ban on tourists, business travellers and students from seven other countries, Trump said it was because of a high rate of visa overstays by its citizens.As we have reported, Egypt is not on the list of banned countries - despite Trump citing the recent attack in Colorado by an Egyptian national when announcing the travel ban.\\nHuman rights groups slam \\'downright cruel\\' banpublished at 05:39 British Summer Time05:39 BSTpublished at 04:3904:39\\nImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, During President Trump\\'s first term there were many protests against his original travel banHuman rights groups have criticsed the ban, with Amnesty International USA describing it as \"discriminatory, racist, and downright cruel\".\"By targeting people based on their nationality, this ban only spreads disinformation and hate,\" it wrote in a post on social media site X.Human Rights First, also based in the US, condemned it as \"yet another anti-immigrant and punitive action, external taken by President Trump\". “The ban will harm refugees, asylum seekers, and other vulnerable populations, including many who have been waiting to reunite with loved ones in our country,\" said the organisation\\'s Senior Director of Refugee Advocacy Robyn Barnard in a statement.\"Bans do nothing to make our country secure, but rather undermine our national security and arbitrarily target those most in need of protection,\" he said.\\nOlympics and World Cup won\\'t be affected by banpublished at 05:11 British Summer Time05:11 BSTpublished at 04:1104:11\\nImage source, ReutersSeveral major sporting events are due to be held in the US over the next few years.These include the 2026 World Cup - jointly hosted by Canada, Mexico and the US - and the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. As it stands, though, the travel ban will seemingly not affect athletes from prohibited countries competing.The almost 4,500 word long proclamation contains a single line which outlines the exemption: \"any athlete or member of an athletic team, including coaches, persons performing a necessary support role, and immediate relatives, traveling for the World Cup, Olympics, or other major sporting event as determined by the Secretary of State\".\\nTravel, Biden and Harvard: Trump\\'s orders at a glancepublished at 04:50 British Summer Time04:50 BSTpublished at 03:5003:50\\nA few hours ago, US President Donald Trump signed a proclamation banning citizens of a dozen countries from travelling to the US.If you\\'re just joining us, here\\'s what to know:\\nStarting on Monday, 9 June, citizens from 12 countries are set to be banned from travelling to the US: Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen\\nAnother seven countries have come under a partial ban: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela\\nIn a video message, Trump cited the recent attack in Colorado as an example of foreign nationals entering the US without being \"properly vetted\". The alleged attacker was an Egyptian national - but Egypt has been left out of the ban\\nThe travel ban has been met with dismay in the targeted countries. Venezuela has described the Trump administration as \"supremacists who think they own the world\", while Somalia has pledged to \"engage in dialogue to address the concerns raised\"\\nDespite its sweeping nature, the travel ban contains exemptions to some, such as immigrants who are \"ethnic and religious minorities facing persecution in Iran\" and athletes travelling for major sporting events\\nAnd this is not the only big announcement from the White House today: Trump has also signed an executive order to restrict foreign student visas at Harvard University, and ordered an inquiry into what he says was a \"conspiracy\" to cover up former President Joe Biden\\'s cognitive health decline\\nWe\\'ll continue to bring you the latest updates as we get them.

Egypt is one of the biggest beneficiaries of US economic and military aid in the Middle East, receiving a total of $1.4bn from US agencies in 2023.During his first term, Trump built close ties with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. The Egyptian leader, who has ruled the country with an iron first for the past decade, has been described by Trump as his \"favourite dictator\".However, bilateral ties in Trump\\'s second term have been complicated by Israel\\'s war in Gaza. Trump\\'s suggestions for displaced Palestinians to be relocated to Egypt has been rejected by Cairo, which is trying to lead efforts to reconstruct a war-ravaged Gaza.\\nThis is a savvier version of Trump\\'s 2017 travel ban - and it\\'s designed to lastpublished at 04:11 British Summer Time04:11 BSTpublished at 03:1103:11Jake KwonNorth America Correspondent\\nPresident Trump is resurrecting\\nhis earlier travel ban - but this time, with more calculation.His first attempt targeted seven Muslim-majority\\ncountries. It was immediately challenged in courts across the US. Its opponents\\nargued the ban was unconstitutional and\\nillegal because it discriminated against travellers based on their religion.The White House amended the travel\\nban twice to dispel the air of religious discrimination, which eventually won\\nit the Supreme Court\\'s approval. This time, Trump has learned his lesson.His administration reinstated a version of the order\\nsimilar to the one that was upheld by the Supreme Court. This version does not\\ntarget Muslim nations. Its stated rationale for the selection of countries is visa overstay\\nrates or political instability in the target country.And unlike the earlier version,\\nwhich was to last for only 90 to 120 days, today\\'s order has no end date. It\\nmerely calls for a periodic review.\\nHarvard calls Trump ban on new foreign students \\'retaliatory\\'published at 03:46 British Summer Time03:46 BSTpublished at 02:4602:46\\nHarvard University has denounced Trump\\'s executive order, which now bans it from bringing in new foreign students for six months.\"This is yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard\\'s First Amendment rights,\" said a Harvard spokesman. \"Harvard will continue to protect its international students.\"Trump signed an order to restrict foreign student visas at Harvard - amid an escalating battle between universities and the US president - along with his recently announced travel ban.\"President Trump wants our institutions to have foreign students, but believes that the foreign students should be people that can love our country,\" the White House said in a fact sheet.It alleged Harvard was the top overseas academic institution for Chinese Communist Party officials, noting that President Xi Jinping’s daughter had studied there in the 2010s.According to the White House, Harvard had a history of foreign ties with potential security implications, failed to supply sufficient information about students\\' illegal activities; and had extensive contacts with foreign adversaries such as China. It also said that many agitators behind antisemitic incidents were foreign students.\\nFor Trump, this is a campaign promise fulfilledpublished at 03:30 British Summer Time03:30 BSTpublished at 02:3002:30Bernd Debusmann JrReporting from Washington\\nFor those who have been watching Trump closely over the last year, today\\'s announcement comes as no surprise.Reinstating a travel ban - a key part of his first administration - contributed to Trump\\'s successful 2024 campaign. Last July, for example, Trump told rallygoers in Minnesota he would \"restore the travel ban, suspend refugee admissions, stop the resettlement and keep the terrorists the hell out of our country.\"As someone who previously focused on reporting about the US-Mexico border and immigration issues, I find it notable that the partial travel bans include citizens of Cuba and Venezuela, two of the countries that made up the bulk of arrivals at the border during Biden\\'s term. Since returning to office, Trump\\'s team has often used the phrase \"promises made, promises kept\" - they are likely to use it again in the coming days.\\nReaction from affected countries is starting to come throughpublished at 03:11 British Summer Time03:11 BSTpublished at 02:1102:11\\nImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Venezuela\\'s Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello reacted angrily to the announcementWe\\'re starting to get reaction from some of the countries mentioned in Trump\\'s latest travel ban.Venezuela is one of seven countries affected by partial restrictions.

Meanwhile, Somalia - now hit with a full travel ban - has responded by immediately promising to work with the US to address security issues.

He said the list could be revised and new countries could be added.The proclamation is effective on June 9, 2025, at 12.01am EDT (4.01am GMT). Visas issued before that date will not be revoked, the order said.During his first term in office, Trump announced a ban on travellers from seven Muslim-majority nations, a policy that went through several iterations before it was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018.Former President Joe Biden, a Democrat who succeeded Trump, repealed that ban on nationals from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen in 2021, calling it “a stain on our national conscience.”Trump said the countries subject to the most severe restrictions were determined to harbour a “large-scale presence of terrorists,” fail to cooperate on visa security and have an inability to verify travelers’ identities, inadequate record-keeping of criminal histories and high rates of visa overstays in the United States.Trump claimed there were “millions and millions of these illegals who should not be in our country”.“We will not let what happened in Europe happen to America,” he said, adding, “very simply, we cannot have open migration from any country where we cannot safely and reliably vet and screen those who seek to enter the United States”.“We will not allow people to enter our country who wish to do us harm.”An Egyptian national, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, has been charged in the attack. Federal officials said Soliman had overstayed his tourist visa and had an expired work permit - although Egypt is not on the list of countries facing travel limits.Somalia immediately pledged to work with the US to address security issues.“Somalia values its longstanding relationship with the United States and stands ready to engage in dialogue to address the concerns raised,” Dahir Hassan Abdi, the Somali ambassador to the United States, said in a statement.Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, a close ally of President Nicolas Maduro, responded on Wednesday evening by describing the US government as fascist and warning Venezuelans of being in the US“The truth is being in the United States is a big risk for anybody, not just for Venezuelans ... They persecute our countrymen, our people for no reason.”A spokesperson for the Taliban-led Afghan foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Pakistan’s foreign ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment on how it would handle the thousands of Afghans waiting in Islamabad who had been in the pipeline for US resettlement.Calls early on Thursday to the spokesperson of Myanmar’s military government were not answered. The foreign ministry of Laos did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump campaigned on a tough border strategy and previewed his plan in an October 2023 speech, pledging to restrict people from the Gaza Strip, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen and “anywhere else that threatens our security”.Trump issued an executive order on January 20 requiring intensified security vetting of any foreigners seeking admission to the US to detect national security threats. That order directed several cabinet members to submit a list of countries from which travel should be partly or fully suspended because their “vetting and screening information is so deficient.”The latest travel restrictions were first reported by CBS News.In March, Reuters reported that the Trump administration was considering travel restrictions on dozens of countries.\\n```\\n\\n## [Trump Escalates Feud With Harvard Over International Students in New Order](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-harvard-international-students-order-2081178) (#106456)\\n\\n> 2025-06-05 01:30:34+00:00\\n\\n```\\nBy\\nSonam Sheth is an Evening Politics Editor at Newsweek who is based in New York.

Inconsistencies may occur.\\nThe White House escalated its battle with Harvard University on Wednesday as President Donald Trump signed a proclamation blocking nearly all foreign students from entering the United States to attend the prestigious Ivy League institution.Newsweek reached out to Harvard via email Wednesday night for comment.The ContextTrump\\'s move comes after a federal judge blocked his administration from revoking Harvard\\'s ability to enroll international students.Harvard and other Ivy League schools have drawn Trump\\'s ire since he took office in January over pro-Palestinian student activism on campus. His administration has accused the schools of allowing antisemitism and facilitating the spread of pro-Hamas propaganda by permitting the campus protests, which free-speech advocates say are protected by the First Amendment.What To Know\"I have determined that the entry of the class of foreign nationals described above is detrimental to the interests of the United States because, in my judgment, Harvard\\'s conduct has rendered it an unsuitable destination for foreign students and researchers,\" Trump said in his Wednesday order.The president\\'s directive stems from Harvard\\'s refusal to submit to the administration\\'s demands to change its hiring and admission policies and eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, among other issues.Trump\\'s battle with the Cambridge, Massachusetts, university has also intensified in recent days after the school refused his administration\\'s request for records related to foreign students\\' misconduct.\"Protecting our national security requires host institutions of foreign students to provide sufficient information, when asked, to enable the Federal Government to identify and address misconduct by those foreign students,\" Trump said in the proclamation. \"In my judgment, it presents an unacceptable risk to our Nation\\'s security for an academic institution to refuse to provide sufficient information, when asked, about known instances of misconduct and criminality committed by its foreign students.\"\\nStudents from Harvard University\\'s Kennedy School attend the all-university commencement on the Harvard campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on May 29.\\nVCG via AP Images\\nWhat People Are SayingRepublican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana on X, formerly Twitter, on Wednesday: \"Harvard went so far woke that they violated our civil rights laws.

The revocation continues a series of government actions to retaliate against Harvard for our refusal to surrender our academic independence and to submit to the federal government\\'s illegal assertion of control over our curriculum, our faculty, and our student body.\"Garber continued: \"We condemn this unlawful and unwarranted action. It imperils the futures of thousands of students and scholars across Harvard and serves as a warning to countless others at colleges and universities throughout the country who have come to America to pursue their education and fulfill their dreams. We have just filed a complaint, and a motion for a temporary restraining order will follow. As we pursue legal remedies, we will do everything in our power to support our students and scholars. The Harvard International Office will provide periodic updates as new information becomes available.\"Democratic Representative Pramila Jayapal on X on Wednesday: \"This is ridiculous and has nothing to do with national security. It\\'s a thinly veiled revenge ploy in Trump\\'s personal feud with Harvard, and continued authoritarian overreach against free speech.\"In a follow-up post, she added: \"Sadly, it just hurts America and our ability to attract talented students, professors and researchers.\"What Happens NextIt is believed that Harvard will continue fighting the Trump administration in court.Update 6/4/25, 9:46 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information.\\nfairness meterfairness meterNewsweek is committed to journalism that\\'s factual and fair.Hold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.

The move came just days after an Islamic terrorist seeking to \"free Palestine\" set several elderly Jewish women on fire in Colorado with Molotov cocktails. Mohamad Soliman had overstayed a tourist visa during the Biden years but was given work authorization in 2023, which ran out weeks before his attack.\\nALSO SEE: Judge Blocks Deportation of Illegal Immigrant Terrorist\\'s Family\\xa0In a video released by the White House, Trump explained that the United States simply does not have the ability to properly vet people from some of the countries on the ban list, while others were included because they have \"unacceptable\" rates of visa overstays.\\xa0\"We cannot have open migration from any country where we cannot safely and reliably vet and screen... That is why today I am signing a new executive order placing travel restrictions on countries including Yemen, Somalia, Haiti, Libya, and numerous others.\" –President Trump pic.twitter.com/ER7nGM4TO2— The White House (@WhiteHouse) June 4, 2025Trump banned nationals from 12 countries from entering the United States: Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.Several of the countries on the list, according to Trump\\'s proclamation, regularly declined to accept the return of their citizens or had visa overstay rates the administration deemed \"unacceptable\" and indicative of \"a blatant disregard for United States immigration laws.\"Others on the list, like Sudan, Yemen and Somalia, were included for inadequate screening and vetting measures, the administration said.An additional seven countries came under partial travel restrictions, in which entrance into the country under several visa programs was suspended but an outright ban was not implemented. Those countries are Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.\\nAs you\\'d expect, the meltdown on the left began immediately. Accusations of racism and xenophobia are already flowing like milk and honey.\\xa0From his first Muslim Ban, Trump’s travel bans have always betrayed of the ideals and values that inspired America’s Founders.Trump’s use of prejudice and bigotry to bar people from entering the U.S. does not make us safer, it just divides us and weakens our global leadership.— Rep. Don Beyer (@RepDonBeyer) June 4, 2025Ah, yes, America\\'s founders were big on the ideal of importing people from violent Islamic countries on visas. I\\'m not sure how this hurts our \"global leadership\" either. Is the argument that Afghanistan, Iran, and Libya won\\'t respect us anymore? Because I\\'ve got some news for Democrats if that\\'s the case.\\xa0I would further quibble with the idea that this doesn\\'t make it safer. It objectively makes America safer not to offer visas to countries that breed terrorists. That\\'s just common sense.\\xa0— Yassamin Ansari (@yassaminansari) June 5, 2025To be clear, there\\'s nothing racist about this ban. For one, Muslim is not a race, and not all the countries listed are predominantly Muslim. Two, the countries on the list are home to several different races. Three, I don\\'t think I\\'m going to take my cues on what is un-American from a Democrat congresswoman who is more concerned about nations on the other side of the globe than her own.\\nThis may be my favorite response, though.\\xa0If MAGA doesn’t believe this is a Muslim travel ban then explain this from the order itself. pic.twitter.com/gRWwjLtmET— Vince Wilson (@VinceWilsonShow) June 5, 2025You know, for all this concern about this being a \"Muslim ban\" (it\\'s not), maybe Islamic terrorists could try not doing so much terrorism. Is it Donald Trump\\'s fault that they represent such a threat to the safety of Americans? Should he let them in just so Muslim countries don\\'t feel singled out? That\\'s the argument? Really?\\xa0As has been explained many times, no one has a right to immigrate to the United States. If we can\\'t properly vet people from certain countries, then a ban is justified. With that said, we\\'ll see how long it takes before some random lower court judge strikes this down and sets off a lengthy legal fight.\\nEditor’s Note: Every single day, here at RedState, we will stand up and fight against the radical left and deliver the conservative reporting our readers deserve.Help us continue to tell the truth.

The ban, which goes into effect on Monday, bars travel to the United States by citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. And it limits travel from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.Here are some of the exemptions:Green card holders: People with green cards — individuals who have a pathway to U.S. citizenship — are exempted from the ban. When a travel ban was introduced by Mr. Trump during his first term in 2017, chaos and confusion ensued at airports. The Department of Homeland Security had to put out a statement clarifying that green card holders could enter the country. This time, the administration is making that exemption clear in the order itself.Dual citizens: People who are American citizens but also hold citizenship with a banned country are exempt under the order.Those seeking visas through connections to U.S. family members: Immigrants from the banned countries who seek visas through connections to their spouses, children, or parents who are American citizens will still be able to apply for them.Certain athletes: Athletes and coaches traveling to the United States to play in major sporting events, along with their families, will still be allowed into the country, despite the ban. The United States is one of the hosts of the World Cup in 2026, and Los Angeles is the site of the Summer Olympics in 2028. This exception will allow soccer players from targeted countries, like Iran, to enter the United States for the World Cup.Refugees granted asylum: Those who have been admitted as refugees or were granted asylum are exempted under the order.Afghans who helped the U.S.: The order exempts Afghans who seek to enter the U.S. under a special visa program for those helped the U.S. government during the two decades of war after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.Iranians fleeing religious persecution: Iranians who are escaping the country because they belong to a religious minority, like Christianity, are also exempted.Hamed Aleaziz covers the Department of Homeland Security and immigration policy for The Times.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\\n```\\n\\n## [Trump signs travel ban on nationals from 12 countries, restrictions on 7 more](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-signs-travel-ban-multiple-countries/) (#108082)\\n\\n> 2025-06-05 01:37:00+00:00\\n\\n```\\nBy\\nUpdated on: June 5, 2025 / 6:47 AM EDT\\n/ CBS News\\nTrump White House bans entry from 12 countries\\nTrump issues travel ban on 12 countries, restrictions on 7 more\\n00:44\\nPresident Trump on Wednesday signed a proclamation barring travelers and immigrants from a dozen countries and restricting the entry of nationals of another seven nations, citing concerns about national security.Mr. Trump\\'s proclamation fully bans the entry of foreigners from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. With certain exemptions, Mr. Trump\\'s order bans citizens of those countries seeking to come to the U.S. permanently as legal immigrants, as well as temporary visa holders, like tourists.\\nThe president also partially suspended the entry of travelers and immigrants from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. That part of his proclamation applies to all prospective immigrants from these countries with visas to settle in the U.S. permanently and certain temporary visa holders.The ban is set to take effect at 12:01 a.m. on Monday, June 9.\\xa0Mr. Trump said the sweeping entry restrictions were necessary to address concerns related to terrorism in the countries listed in the order, inadequate vetting of the affected nationals and the lack of cooperation on deportations among some of the nations.\"President Trump is fulfilling his promise to protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors that want to come to our country and cause us harm. These commonsense restrictions are country-specific and include places that lack proper vetting, exhibit high visa overstay rates, or fail to share identity and threat information. President Trump will always act in the best of interest of the American people and their safety,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told CBS News.Mr. Trump\\'s decree contains certain exemptions, including for U.S. permanent residents, the spouses and children of U.S. citizens who have \"clear and convincing evidence of identity and family relationship,\" Afghans who assisted American forces and have special visas, diplomats, athletes and dual nationals with a passport from a country not listed in his proclamation.The announcement of the ban follows an attack Sunday in Boulder, Colorado, on marchers raising attention for Israelis taken hostage by Hamas. The suspect was identified by U.S. officials as an Egyptian national who had overstayed his tourist visa.\\nWhile Mr. Trump did not place any restrictions on the entry of Egyptian nationals, his proclamation directed officials to assess the \"adequacy\" of Egypt\\'s vetting policies, \"in light of recent events.\"In a video statement released by the White House Wednesday night, Mr. Trump said the Boulder attack \"underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted, as well as those who come here as temporary visitors and overstay their visas. We don\\'t want them.\"\\xa0He said the list could be revised if countries make material improvements, and new countries could be added as threats emerge.\\xa0Mr. Trump\\'s actions echo a series of travel bans issued during his first administration that initially targeted predominantly Muslim countries. Like those orders, his latest proclamation could be subject to lawsuits.In the first month of his first term, January 2017, Mr. Trump signed a travel ban restricting the entry of most citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The move triggered widespread outcry, chaos at airports and legal challenges from advocates who argued the ban was discriminatory.\\nIn March 2017, Mr. Trump removed Iraq from the list and added Chad, Venezuela and North Korea. In 2020, he expanded the ban, adding immigration restrictions for nationals of Nigeria, Eritrea, Sudan, Tanzania, Myanmar and Kyrgyzstan. Chad was later removed from the list.The third version of Mr. Trump\\'s first-term ban was ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court in the summer of 2018, with the conservative justices citing the president\\'s broad authority to restrict the entry of foreigners on national security grounds. The Biden administration scrapped that ban after it took office.\\nTrump Administration\\nJennifer Jacobs\\nJennifer Jacobs is a senior White House reporter at CBS News.\\n```\\n\\n## [Donald Trump bans 19 countries from entering US as President issues chilling warning to country that could be next](https://www.gbnews.com/politics/us/donald-trump-bans-countries-entering-us-president-issues-warning) (#108117)\\n\\n> 2025-06-05 07:12:47+00:00\\n\\n```\\nPresident Donald Trump has banned citizens from 19 countries from entering the United States. The sweeping restrictions affect 12 countries with complete entry bans: Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.Seven additional nations face partial restrictions: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.The President justified the measures as essential for protecting America from \"foreign terrorists\" and security threats.Trump has made the sweeping restrictionsReutersDonald Trump gestures after he confirmed the banThe scene from the incident in ColoradoReutersTrump stated that countries facing the harshest restrictions were identified as harbouring a \"large-scale presence of terrorists\" and failing to cooperate on visa security.He cited their inability to verify travellers\\' identities, inadequate criminal record-keeping and high rates of visa overstays in America.\"We cannot have open migration from any country where we cannot safely and reliably vet and screen those who seek to enter the United States,\" Trump said.The proclamation specifies that visas issued before the June 9 deadline will remain valid and will not be revoked.This marks Trump\\'s second attempt at implementing travel restrictions, following his first-term ban on seven Muslim-majority nations that was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018.Former US president Joe BidenGettyVenezuela\\'s Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said the move was fascist ReutersHis predecessor Joe Biden had repealed those restrictions in 2021, calling them \"a stain on our national conscience.\"Trump first previewed these plans in an October 2023 speech, pledging to restrict people from Gaza, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen and \"anywhere else that threatens our security.\"International reactions have been swift and varied. Somalia immediately pledged cooperation, with Ambassador Dahir Hassan Abdi stating: \"Somalia values its longstanding relationship with the United States and stands ready to engage in dialogue to address the concerns raised.\"Venezuela\\'s response was markedly different. Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello described the US government as fascist and warned Venezuelans about being in America.He said: \"The truth is being in the United States is a big risk for anybody, not just for Venezuelans...they persecute our countrymen, our people for no reason.\"The restrictions threaten to derail existing plans, including a 31-year-old Myanmar teacher\\'s participation in a US State Department exchange programme scheduled for September.\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

      "{'id': 80, 'title': \"Bengaluru Stampede, Korean Leadership, Canadian Wildfires & Trump's Trade War\", 'content': '## Main Stories\\n\\n<u>**Bengaluru IPL Celebrations End in Tragedy as Stampede Claims Lives**</u>\\nCelebrations for **Royal Challengers Bengaluru\\'s (RCB)** Indian Premier League (IPL) victory turned deadly on **June 4, 2025**, when a stampede outside **M. Chinnaswamy Stadium** in **Bengaluru** resulted in at least **11 deaths** and dozens of injuries. The chaos erupted as an unexpectedly large crowd attempted to enter the stadium for the victory parade, leading to police employing a \\'lathi charge\\' (baton charge) to disperse them.\\n\\nThe **Karnataka state government**, led by Chief Minister **Siddaramaiah**, has expressed sadness and acknowledged the overwhelming crowd size. An investigation is undoubtedly underway, or will be shortly. The **Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)** termed the incident \\'unfortunate,\\' a rather mild assessment, and pointed to a need for better planning. This is a recurring issue in India, where large, passionate crowds and sometimes inadequate infrastructure or planning for such events can lead to tragic outcomes. The immediate focus is on treating the injured, transported to **Vydehi Multispecialty Hospital** and **Bowring Hospital**, but the long-term questions will revolve around accountability and preventative measures for future large-scale public gatherings, particularly high-stakes sporting events.\\n\\n<u>**South Korea Navigates Turmoil: Lee Jae-myung Takes Helm After Yoon\\'s Ouster**</u>\\n**Lee Jae-myung** has been inaugurated as the new President of **South Korea** on **June 4, 2025**, following a period of profound political upheaval. His predecessor, **Yoon Suk Yeol**, was impeached and removed from office earlier this year after his controversial declaration of martial law in **December 2024**. Lee secured **49.4%** of the vote in the subsequent snap election.\\n\\nLee faces a daunting array of challenges. The South Korean economy is under strain, partly due to the impact of **US tariffs** (a point of friction with the **Trump** administration). Persistent tensions with **North Korea** and its nuclear ambitions remain a primary security concern. Domestically, the political landscape is deeply fractured. Lee has pledged to prioritize economic recovery, seek dialogue with Pyongyang while enhancing the US alliance and trilateral cooperation with Japan, and foster national unity. However, his administration\\'s intention to investigate the circumstances surrounding Yoon\\'s martial law declaration could easily reignite political animosities. Yoon defended his actions as a response to the **Democratic Party\\'s** obstruction, a sentiment echoed by conservative candidate **Kim Moon-soo**. The situation underscores the fragility of democratic norms when political polarization reaches extreme levels.\\n\\n<u>**Canadian Wildfires: Evacuations Mount, Smoke Blankets Continents**</u>\\nCanada is grappling with a severe wildfire season, forcing over **33,000 evacuations**, primarily in **Manitoba** and **Saskatchewan**, where states of emergency are in effect. More than **200 wildfires** are burning, over half of them out of control. The scale of the evacuations in Manitoba is described by Premier **Wab Kinew** as the largest in the province\\'s recent history.\\n\\nThe impact extends far beyond Canadian borders. Smoke plumes are degrading air quality across the northern **United States**, particularly **New England**, with **New York City** issuing alerts. The smoke has even reportedly reached **Europe**. While some meteorological analyses suggest **NYC\\'s** poor air quality is a complex mix of factors including ground-level ozone exacerbated by warm, stagnant conditions, the wildfire smoke is undeniably a contributing factor to regional haze and health advisories. The Canadian government has requested international assistance to combat the blazes. This event highlights the cascading, transboundary effects of large-scale environmental disasters, increasingly linked to changing climate patterns.\\n\\n<u>**Trump Doubles Down: Steel and Aluminum Tariffs Hit 50%, Global Trade Braces**</u>\\nThe **Trump** administration escalated trade tensions on **June 4, 2025**, by increasing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to a significant **50%**. This move, ostensibly to protect and revitalize the **US steel industry**, has sent ripples of concern through global markets and drawn threats of retaliation.\\n\\nAllies are not amused. The **European Union** has voiced strong concern and is contemplating countermeasures. While the **United Kingdom** managed to secure a temporary \\'carve-out,\\' maintaining the original **25% tariff** for now, this is contingent on ongoing trade deal negotiations with the **US**, led by Prime Minister **Keir Starmer** and Trade Secretary **Jonathan Reynolds**. The deadline for the US to assess UK compliance is looming in early **July**. Simultaneously, **China** is tightening its control over critical mineral exports, a move that can be interpreted as a response to US trade pressures and an assertion of its dominance in these strategic supply chains. The tariffs will inevitably increase costs for industries reliant on these metals, with potential downstream effects on consumer prices for goods ranging from appliances to vehicles. The administration\\'s stance is that such pressure is necessary, particularly with the EU, which **Trump** described as \\'very difficult to deal with.\\'\\n\\n<u>**White House Escalates Pressure: Universities, Travel, and Foreign Aid in Crosshairs**</u>\\nThe **Trump** administration is intensifying its actions on multiple fronts, targeting universities, implementing a new travel ban, and seeking to slash foreign aid. **Harvard University** faces a six-month restriction on foreign student visas, signed by **President Trump** on **June 4**, following an earlier attempt by DHS Secretary **Kristi Noem** to revoke its **Student and Exchange Visitor Program** certification (temporarily blocked by a court). **Columbia University** is also under pressure, with its accreditor notified by the **Department of Education** of alleged anti-discrimination law violations. The administration cites concerns over antisemitism and foreign ties, particularly with **China**, as justification.\\n\\nConcurrently, a new travel ban restricting entry from **12 countries** and partially from **7 others** went into effect on **June 9**, framed as a national security imperative. Critics, however, are quick to label it a \\'Muslim ban,\\' echoing past controversies. Furthermore, **Trump** has formally requested Congress to rescind already approved funds for foreign aid, particularly impacting **USAID**, and public media. This move has drawn criticism from figures like Democratic Representative **Pramila Jayapal**, who warns of detrimental effects on global health, US soft power, and press freedom. Adding to the foreign policy shifts, the US Ambassador to Turkey, **Thomas Barrack**, announced a reduction of US military presence in **Syria** from eight bases to one. These actions collectively signal a significant, and contentious, policy direction impacting academic freedom, immigration, and America\\'s global engagement.\\n\\n<u>**UK Institutions Under Pressure: Financial Woes, Regulatory Failures, and Criminal Probes**</u>\\nSeveral prominent **UK** institutions are currently navigating a confluence of financial, regulatory, and even criminal challenges, painting a picture of systemic stress. The **Post Office**, still reeling from the **Horizon IT scandal**, is reportedly exploring asset sales or further borrowing to meet sub-postmasters\\' pay targets, with Chairman **Nigel Railton** highlighting uncertainty over government funding.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the future of **Thames Water**, the UK\\'s largest water utility, is increasingly precarious after US private equity firm **KKR** withdrew its rescue bid. The company requires massive investment to address failing infrastructure and persistent sewage spills. On the regulatory front, water regulator **Ofwat** has ordered **Northumbrian Water** to pay out **£15.7 million** for its network failings. Adding to the bleak landscape, **HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC)** admitted to a **£47 million loss** due to a sophisticated phishing scam that compromised around **100,000 taxpayer accounts**. HMRC executives **John-Paul Marks** and **Angela MacDonald** are managing the fallout, asserting taxpayers will suffer no financial loss. Finally, a deeply concerning police investigation has been launched into patient deaths following heart operations at **Castle Hill Hospital** in East Yorkshire, specifically focusing on Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) procedures. The case of **Dorothy Readhead**, who died in **2020** after a TAVI procedure, is central, with reports of conflicting mortality rate assessments between the **Humber Health Care Partnership** and independent reviews.\\n\\n<u>**Ukraine\\'s Deep Strike, Trump-Putin Dialogue, and Domestic Budget Discord**</u>\\n**Ukraine** executed a significant drone offensive, dubbed \\'Operation Spiderweb,\\' on **June 1, 2025**, targeting multiple **Russian** airbases. Kyiv claims substantial damage to Russian aircraft, including strategic cruise missile carriers, an operation reportedly 18 months in the planning involving smuggled drones. The **White House** confirmed **President Trump** had no prior knowledge of the attack. The Kremlin, while acknowledging the attack, downplayed its severity, a standard Russian response.\\n\\nThe strikes precipitated a lengthy phone call on **June 4** between **President Trump** and **Russian President Vladimir Putin**. During the conversation, **Putin** reportedly vowed that **Russia** would respond to the Ukrainian attacks, raising concerns about potential escalation and even nuclear rhetoric, which has been amplified by advisors in both Moscow and around **Trump**. Simultaneously, on the domestic front, **Trump** faces unexpected criticism from **Elon Musk**, who publicly decried the President\\'s latest budget bill as a \\'disgusting abomination\\' due to its impact on the deficit and debt ceiling. This spat, particularly Musk\\'s opposition to cuts in EV tax credits which would affect **Tesla**, exposes fissures within potential Republican-aligned circles and complicates the administration\\'s economic messaging, even as House Speaker **Mike Johnson** defends the bill.\\n\\n<u>**Gaza Aid Operations Suspended Amidst Deadly Incidents and Political Scrutiny**</u>\\nHumanitarian aid distribution in **Gaza** is in a state of crisis. The **Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF)**, a US-backed organization, suspended its operations on **June 4, 2025**, following deadly incidents where **Israeli forces (IDF)** reportedly fired on Palestinians seeking aid near GHF distribution sites. The **IDF** declared access roads to these sites \\'combat zones,\\' stating troops fired after \\'suspects\\' approached them in an endangering manner. Palestinian sources, including **Gaza\\'s Ministry of Health**, report significant casualties. The GHF, now led by newly appointed executive chairman **Johnnie Moore** (an evangelical Christian with ties to the **Trump** administration), initially stated it had no evidence of attacks *at* its facilities, a claim that sits uneasily with widespread reports of fatalities nearby.\\n\\nThe appointment of **Moore** and the GHF\\'s operational model have drawn criticism from other humanitarian organizations regarding its perceived lack of independence from **Israel**. This crisis unfolds against a backdrop of international pressure. In the **UK**, Parliament is debating a bill, championed by Independent MP **Jeremy Corbyn**, demanding an inquiry into Britain\\'s involvement in Israeli military operations and arms sales. Meanwhile, **Norway\\'s** parliament rejected a call to divest its massive sovereign wealth fund from companies linked to Israeli activities in occupied Palestinian territories, though Prime Minister **Jens Stoltenberg** affirmed adherence to an ethical regime that does divest from companies breaching international law. The situation underscores the immense difficulty of delivering aid in a conflict zone where military operations and humanitarian needs collide with tragic consequences.\\n\\n<u>**Arrest in Palm Springs Clinic Bombing: Anti-Natalist Terrorism Suspected**</u>\\nAn arrest has been made in connection with the **May 17, 2025, bombing** of the **American Reproductive Centers** fertility clinic in **Palm Springs, California**. **Daniel Park**, a 32-year-old US citizen from Kent, Washington, was apprehended at **JFK airport** in New York on **June 3**, after being deported from **Poland**.\\n\\nAuthorities, including US Attorney **Bill Essayli**, allege that **Park** provided material support to **Guy Edward Bartkus**, the individual believed to have carried out the bombing and who died in the blast. This support allegedly included shipping ammonium nitrate, a key bomb-making component, to **Bartkus**. Investigators believe the bombing was an act of terrorism motivated by anti-natalist views – an ideology opposing procreation. **Bartkus** reportedly left writings expressing opposition to bringing people into the world against their will. The clinic, a clear target for such an ideology, reopened at a new location about two weeks after the attack. The investigation continues, but this arrest marks a significant step in a disturbing case of ideologically motivated violence.\\n\\n## United Kingdom focus\\n\\n<u>**Greater Manchester Lands £2.5 Billion for \"Gamechanging\" Transport Overhaul**</u>\\n**Greater Manchester** has secured a **£2.5 billion** transport funding deal from the national government, a sum initially promised by former Prime Minister **Rishi Sunak** to compensate for the scrapped northern leg of **HS2**. The investment, announced by current Prime Minister **Keir Starmer**, is aimed at a significant expansion and modernization of the **Bee Network**, the region\\'s public transport system.\\n\\nKey projects include a long-awaited **Metrolink tram extension to Stockport**, the procurement of **1,000 new electric buses**, and the construction of new tram stops in **Manchester, Bury, and Oldham**. Mayor **Andy Burnham** hailed the deal as a \\'gamechanging moment,\\' envisioning the creation of the UK’s first fully electric, zero-emission integrated public transport system by **2030**. While there\\'s considerable local optimism, and **Burnham** is pushing for construction on the Stockport line to begin within the current Parliament, some skepticism remains regarding the timely delivery of these ambitious projects, given past unfulfilled promises in regional transport and the necessary Treasury approvals for specific business cases. Chancellor **Rachel Reeves** has indicated a shift away from Treasury rules that historically favored investment in London and the South East.\\n\\n<u>**Government Eases Winter Fuel Payment Cuts Amid Pension Reform Push**</u>\\nThe **UK government** has executed a partial reversal of its controversial decision to means-test **Winter Fuel Payments** for pensioners. Chancellor **Rachel Reeves** confirmed on **June 4, 2025**, that more pensioners will be eligible for the payment this winter due to an easing of the means test, which was previously tied strictly to **Pension Credit** eligibility. This U-turn follows political backlash against the initial cuts.\\n\\nHowever, Pensions Minister **Torsten Bell** clarified that there is \"no prospect\" of returning to a universal payment system, indicating the government remains committed to some form of targeting to avoid payments to higher-income individuals. The Winter Fuel Payment is worth between **£200 and £300**. Simultaneously, the government is advancing broader pension reforms through the **Pension Schemes Bill**, detailed on **June 5**. This legislation aims to consolidate numerous small pension pots, often accrued by workers changing jobs, into larger, potentially better-performing \\'megafunds\\' to improve retirement incomes. Work and Pensions Secretary **Liz Kendall** framed the bill as a move to secure better value for savers and drive investment in British businesses.\\n\\n## Global landscape\\n\\n<u>**Hurricane Season 2025: Coastal Risks, Insurance Woes, and Inland Preparedness**</u>\\nThe **2025 hurricane season** is officially underway, bringing with it stark warnings about escalating risks from wind damage and storm surge, particularly for coastal regions of the **United States**. A new report from **Cotality** indicates that **6.4 million U.S. homes** are at risk of storm surge, and a staggering **33.1 million** face potential wind damage. This heightened risk environment is contributing to rising insurance costs, which are beginning to impact coastal home sales.\\n\\nAuthorities are emphasizing comprehensive preparedness. In **Orange County, Florida**, officials are reminding residents to include pets in their emergency plans, highlighting \\'Trooper\\'s Law,\\' which criminalizes animal abandonment during declared disasters and goes into effect **October 1**. Meteorologists in inland areas like **East Texas** are also stressing the need for readiness, as hurricanes can bring heavy rain, flooding, and even tornadoes far from the coast, as demonstrated by **Hurricane Beryl** in **2024**. The focus is on proactive measures, from securing property to having evacuation plans that account for all family members, including animals.\\n\\n## Superpower monitor\\n\\n<u>**Biden\\'s Final Acts Under Scrutiny: Pardons, Cognitive State, and Autopen Use Probed**</u>\\nFormer **US President Joe Biden\\'s** final weeks in office, particularly his slew of pardons and questions surrounding his cognitive state, are now the subject of multiple investigations. **President Donald Trump** has ordered an inquiry, to be led by Attorney General **Pam Bondi**, into **Biden\\'s** alleged cognitive decline and the use of an autopen for signing official documents, including some pardons. This follows the **House Oversight Committee**, chaired by **James Comer**, expanding its own probe into these matters, requesting interviews with former senior **Biden** aides like **Ron Klain**.\\n\\nThe pardons in question, issued on **January 19, 2025**, included his son **Hunter Biden** (whom **Biden** had previously vowed not to pardon), former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. **Mark Milley**, Dr. **Anthony Fauci**, members of the **January 6th Committee**, and other family members. **Comer** has labeled the alleged cover-up of **Biden\\'s** mental state \"one of the greatest scandals in our nation’s history.\" **Biden** has refuted claims of cognitive decline, stating his memory is \"fine.\" While the use of autopens by presidents is not unprecedented (including during the **Trump** administration), the current investigations aim to determine if its use in **Biden\\'s** case was intended to mask incapacity, which **Trump** argues would constitute an \"unconstitutional wielding of the power of the Presidency.\" Both **Fauci** and **Milley** issued statements expressing gratitude for the pardons, citing politically motivated threats of investigation.\\n\\n## Economic currents\\n\\n<u>**Tech Giants Meta, Yandex, and Adidas Under Fire for Data Practices**</u>\\nMajor corporations **Meta** and **Yandex** are accused of employing covert methods to bypass **Android** privacy protections, enabling them to track user web browsing activity through their respective apps. Research published on **June 4, 2025**, detailed how these companies allegedly exploited local port communication to link web activity to app users, effectively circumventing **Android\\'s** sandboxing features. In response, **Meta** has paused the implicated tracking feature and is in discussions with **Google**, while **Yandex** stated it is discontinuing the practice. **Google** is investigating and has implemented some mitigations, condemning the techniques as violating its security and privacy principles.\\n\\nSeparately, German sportswear giant **Adidas** confirmed it suffered a data breach originating from a compromised third-party vendor. The breach exposed customer contact information, though **Adidas** asserts that no payment details or passwords were compromised. The company has begun notifying potentially affected customers. These incidents collectively underscore the persistent challenges in safeguarding user data. The **Meta/Yandex** case highlights sophisticated attempts to circumvent platform-level privacy controls, while the **Adidas** breach serves as another reminder of the vulnerabilities introduced by third-party dependencies in the corporate ecosystem. Regulatory scrutiny is likely to follow.\\n\\n## Tech & science developments\\n\\n<u>**AI Frontier: Navigating Hype, Ethical Quandaries, and Practical Hurdles**</u>\\nThe artificial intelligence landscape is a flurry of activity, marked by rapid advancements, significant corporate investment, and a growing chorus of concerns regarding ethics, security, and resource demands. While companies like **Huawei** claim breakthroughs in AI training methods using proprietary chips, and **AMC Networks** partners with AI startup **Runway** for marketing and development, a critical counter-narrative is also emerging. Experts like **Emily M. Bender** and **Alex Hanna** caution against the \"AGI hype,\" arguing it\\'s often driven by Big Tech\\'s commercial interests rather than genuine breakthroughs towards artificial general intelligence, a concept they deem ill-defined and potentially rooted in problematic biases.\\n\\nEthical considerations are paramount. The **American Psychological Association (APA)** has called for robust guardrails around AI use for young people, citing potential mental health risks. The **UK\\'s Investigatory Powers Commissioner\\'s Office (IPCO)** released an \"AI Proportionality Assessment Aid\" to guide police and intelligence agencies on the responsible use of AI, emphasizing privacy protection. Security is another major challenge, with CISOs urged to revamp data handling policies and secure AI development pipelines. Perhaps one of the most tangible hurdles is AI\\'s immense energy consumption. In a notable move, **Meta** recently secured a 20-year nuclear energy deal to power its AI data centers, highlighting the scale of the energy challenge and the search for stable, emissions-free power sources to fuel AI\\'s growth. Even historical research is being touched, with AI analysis suggesting the **Dead Sea Scrolls** may be older than previously thought.\\n\\n<u>**Nintendo Switch 2 Arrives: Iterative Upgrade Meets Cautious Consumer Interest**</u>\\n**Nintendo** launched its highly anticipated **Switch 2** console on **June 5, 2025**, priced at **$450**. According to a **CNET** survey conducted in **April**, **58%** of US gamers expressed interest in the new device, with **Gen Z** gamers showing even higher enthusiasm (**70%**). However, this interest is tempered by considerations of price and the availability of compelling new games.\\n\\nThe **Switch 2** offers several upgrades over its predecessor, including increased storage, a larger screen, and higher resolution. It maintains backward compatibility with original **Switch** games and introduces new features like **Game Chat** (which will require a **Nintendo Switch Online** subscription after **March 2026**) and Joy-Cons that can function like mice. Analysts like **CNET\\'s Scott Stein** view the **Switch 2** as an iterative improvement rather than a revolutionary leap, suggesting that while it\\'s a worthy upgrade, consumers might not need to rush out and buy it immediately. The console\\'s success will likely depend on its software lineup and its ability to justify the price point in a competitive market.\\n\\n<u>**Tablet and Phone Wars: Thin Designs, AI Integration, and Battery Life Dominate June 2025**</u>\\nThe mobile device market is buzzing with new releases and intensifying competition as **Apple, Samsung, Microsoft**, and **Google** jockey for position. A key trend is the pursuit of ultra-thin designs. **Samsung** has launched the **Galaxy S25 Edge**, a slimmer iteration of its **S25 Plus**. **Apple** is widely rumored to be developing an exceptionally thin **iPhone 17 Air**, potentially featuring a titanium-aluminium alloy frame, with an expected unveiling around **September 2025**. **Microsoft** has entered the fray with its **Surface Pro 12 (2025)**, a **Windows 11** tablet aiming to compete directly with **Apple\\'s iPad** offerings.\\n\\nAI integration is another dominant theme. **Google** is expected to heavily feature its **Gemini AI** in the upcoming **Pixel 10** series (anticipated in **August 2025**), powered by its new **Tensor G5** chip, reportedly manufactured by **TSMC**. **Microsoft** is also pushing AI with its **Copilot+ PCs**, such as the **Surface Laptop 7** and **Asus Zenbook A14**, which boast impressive battery life thanks to efficient **Qualcomm Snapdragon X** processors. Battery life remains a critical selling point across the board, even as devices become thinner. The recently released **Apple Watch Series 10** also features a larger, brighter screen, indicating continued refinement in wearables. This flurry of activity signals a market focused on incremental hardware improvements, deeper AI integration, and a constant push for sleeker form factors.\\n\\n## Noteworthy & under-reported\\n\\n<u>**Cancer Research Front: Breast Cancer Awareness, Sugar\\'s Colon Cancer Link, Ovarian Cancer Drug News**</u>\\nRecent developments in cancer research and awareness are drawing attention. Singer **Jessie J\\'s** announcement of her breast cancer diagnosis on **June 4, 2025**, and upcoming surgery has refocused public attention on the importance of self-checking and early detection. Organizations like the **NHS** and **CoppaFeel!** continue to emphasize regular breast examinations, as breast cancer remains a common malignancy in the **UK**.\\n\\nIn other research news, a study presented at the **American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)** meeting on **June 4** by **Dr. Emma Schatoff** of **Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center** suggests a potential link between high sugar consumption, particularly sugary drinks, and an increased risk of late-stage (de novo metastatic) colon cancer in young adults. This is particularly relevant given the observed rise in early-onset colon cancer since the 1990s. While the study requires further peer review and validation, it points to dietary factors as potential contributors. Separately, a brief report mentioned positive results for **Relacorilant** in treating platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, though more detailed information is pending.\\n\\n<u>**Madeleine McCann Search Reignited in Portugal; Separate Tragedy Sees British Tourist Found Deceased**</u>\\nThe long-running investigation into the disappearance of **Madeleine McCann** has seen renewed activity, with **Portuguese** and **German** police launching a fresh search in **Praia da Luz, Portugal**, on **June 3, 2025**. The search, utilizing ground-penetrating radar and involving excavation of derelict buildings, is focused on areas near the apartment where Madeleine vanished in **May 2007** and locations linked to prime suspect **Christian Brückner**. **Brückner**, a German national, is currently imprisoned for a rape committed in **Praia da Luz** in **2005**. The **Metropolitan Police** are aware of the search but not directly involved. Madeleine\\'s parents, **Kate and Gerry McCann**, maintain their unwavering determination to find answers.\\n\\nIn a separate and tragic development in the same Algarve region, the body of **Greg Monks**, a **29-year-old** British tourist from **Southport**, was found in a ravine near **Albufeira** on **June 4**. **Monks** had gone missing on **May 28** while on a stag party. The discovery has prompted an outpouring of grief and inevitable, though distinct, comparisons to the McCann case due to the location and the nationality of the individuals involved.\\n\\n<u>**Ex-White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre Ditches Democrats, Pens Critical Biden Book**</u>\\n**Karine Jean-Pierre**, who served as **White House Press Secretary** under former President **Joe Biden**, announced on **June 4, 2025**, that she is leaving the **Democratic Party** to register as an independent. This move coincides with the upcoming release of her book, \\'Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines,\\' scheduled for **October 21, 2025**.\\n\\nThe book reportedly delves into **Biden\\'s** decision not to seek reelection in **July 2024**—a decision allegedly influenced by pressure from **Democratic Party** leaders—and offers a critique of the party itself. **Jean-Pierre**, who left her White House role on **January 20, 2025**, states her book advocates for political independence and aims to dismantle disinformation. However, the book\\'s launch is already mired in controversy, with allegations reported by **Axios** reporter **Alex Thompson** that **Jean-Pierre** may have improperly worked with publicist **Gilda Squire** while still employed at the White House, a claim her team denies. This development promises further insider accounts and potential recriminations regarding the final phase of the **Biden** administration.\\n\\n<u>**Dietary Trends: Supplements for Kidney Stones, Planetary Health Diet, and Eye Nutrition Focus**</u>\\nRecent nutritional research highlights several emerging trends. A study presented at **NUTRITION 2025** on **June 4**, led by **Dr. Visith Thongboonkerd** from **Mahidol University, Thailand**, suggests that certain dietary supplements—including caffeine, EGCG (from green tea), NAC, resveratrol, and trigonelline—may inhibit the formation, growth, and aggregation of calcium oxalate kidney stones *in vitro*. While promising, researchers stress the need for further clinical validation before these can be prescribed.\\n\\nThe **Planetary Health Diet**, developed by the **EAT-Lancet Commission** in **2019**, continues to gain traction. Similar to the Mediterranean diet, it emphasizes plant-based foods (fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts) while allowing for moderate amounts of meat, fish, and dairy. Its dual goals are to improve human health and reduce the environmental impact of food production, a critical consideration for a growing global population. Critics, however, note potential challenges regarding cultural practicality, affordability, and nutritional adequacy for all. Separately, specific vitamins and supplements like Vitamins A, C, E, Omega-3 fatty acids, Zinc, Lutein, and Zeaxanthin are consistently highlighted for their roles in maintaining eye health and potentially reducing the risk of conditions like age-related macular degeneration. As always, consultation with a healthcare professional is advised before starting any new supplement regimen.', 'totalArticles': 547, 'totalSources': 206, 'usedArticles': 148, 'usedSources': 45, 'tldr': '[Bengaluru IPL Stampede Tragedy]\\nCelebrations for RCB\\'s IPL victory turned deadly in Bengaluru due to a stampede outside M.

    "4.  **Outputting *only* the section structure and the actual titles of the assigned stories.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Brief Structure & Section Guidelines:** (Use these to categorize)\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  1.  **`## Main Stories`**: This section is for the absolute \"Things You Need To Know Now.\" Select titles representing **aim for 3-5 (certainly no more than 9 exceptionally)** of the most **critically important, high-impact, and urgent** overall developments from this batch. Prioritize stories with clear:\n",
    "    * **Global or Strategic Ramifications:** Events directly impacting international relations, major economies, or significant geopolitical stability.\n",
    "    * **High Severity of Impact:** Situations involving significant human cost (e.g., major disasters, widespread conflict escalation), major economic disruption, or critical security threats.\n",
    "    * **Urgent, Unfolding Developments:** Stories where the situation is rapidly evolving and demands immediate attention.\n",
    "    * **Truly Novel & Consequential Information:** New, unexpected developments that significantly alter understanding or require a shift in perspective, rather than routine updates on known, ongoing situations (unless that update itself is of critical importance).\n",
    "    * Refer to the 'Significance' metadata (especially the numeric 'score' from 0-10) within each story's details in `<input_data>` as a strong guide, but also apply your analytical judgment based on the criteria above.\n",
    "    * If multiple input stories cover different facets of one such *major critical event/theme*, select the single title that best represents the core update or highest immediate impact for this section.\n",
    "    * Consider recency: if a major topic was extensively covered in `## Previous Day's Coverage Context`, only include it here if there's a truly critical new development. Otherwise, allow newer critical stories to take precedence.\n",
    "2.  **`## United Kingdom focus`**: Titles primarily focused on the UK. Violence and crime statistics, cost of living anxieties, health issues.\n",
    "3.  **`## Global landscape`**: Titles covering humanitarian crises eg wars, famine, disease, disasters eg extreme weather events, earthquakes, environmental issues eg deforestation, pollution, biodiversity loss etc.\n",
    "4.  **`## Superpower monitor`**: Titles primarily focused on friction between and caused by USA, UK, Russia and China (policy, economy, tech, etc.).\n",
    "5.  **`## Religion review`**: Titles covering religion's interference in politics, scandals, litigations, accounts of religious oppression and hypocisy.\n",
    "5.  **`## Economic currents`**: Titles covering significant global/regional economic news, inflation, trends, policy, money worries, cryptocurrency especially bitcoin news.\n",
    "6.  **`## Tech & science developments`**: Titles covering AI/LLMs, biomed, space breakthroughs, etc.\n",
    "7.  **`## Noteworthy & under-reported`**: Titles for interesting/potentially important stories not fitting elsewhere, emerging trends. (Up to ~5 titles).\n",
    "8.  **`## Positive developments`**: Titles for human interest stories with genuinely positive outcomes, avoid sport news unless excetionally interesting to all audiences. (Include only if applicable).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Analyze Holistically:** First, carefully read *all* provided `<story>` summaries below (titles and summaries) to understand the key events, themes, and potential connections *before* assigning anything. Think about the bigger picture revealed by the collection.\n",
    "2.  **Select \"What You Need To Know Now\":** Identify the *actual titles* of the stories representing the top ~10 most significant overall developments or themes within this batch. List these titles under `## Main Stories`, ordered by significance/impact.\n",
    "3.  **Assign & Group Remaining Story Titles:** For the ***remaining*** stories (ie not the including the top ~10 most significant overall developments or themes within this batch just determined in the previous step):\n",
    "    *   Assign each story's **actual Title** to the single most appropriate section.\n",
    "    *   **Group Related Titles:** If two or more stories cover the same specific event, interconnected themes, or closely linked developments, place their **actual Titles consecutively** *within* the single most relevant section.\n",
    "    *   **Prioritize Group Placement:** Assign the *entire group* of related titles to the section that best captures their central theme.\n",
    "4.  **Formatting:**\n",
    "    *   Format the output *exactly* as shown in the example below, using the appropriate section headers (`## Section Name`, `### Earthquakes`).\n",
    "    *   List **only the actual `Title`** of each story under its assigned section, preceded by `###`.\n",
    "    *   Use `---` as a separator between *each* story title listed.\n",
    "    *   If a section has no relevant stories, **omit the section header entirely**.\n",
    "5.  **Output:**\n",
    "    *   **Do NOT include introductory/concluding text, explanations, the `<story>` tags, or the executive summaries.**\n",
    "    *   **Output ONLY the structured markdown outline consisting of section headers and the actual story titles from the input data.**\n",
    "    \n",
    "**--- CONTEXT FROM PREVIOUS DAY (IF AVAILABLE) ---**\n",
    "*   You *may* receive a section at the beginning of the curated data titled `## Previous Day's Coverage Context (YYYY-MM-DD)`.\n",
    "*   Use this list **only** to understand which topics are ongoing and their last known status/theme.\n",

Here’s what’s moving the needle.\\n\\n## Main Stories\\n\\n<u>**Mushroom Trial: Patterson\\'s Credibility Under Fire as Deception Allegations Mount**</u>\\nThe **Erin Patterson** mushroom poisoning trial in **Victoria, Australia**, is intensifying. The prosecution, led by **Nanette Rogers SC**, is relentlessly cross-examining **Patterson**, focusing on her admitted lies to police and alleged fabrications, including a supposed cancer diagnosis used to lure the victims to the fatal lunch. The core of the Crown\\'s case is that **Patterson** deliberately poisoned her estranged husband\\'s parents, **Don** and **Gail Patterson**, and **Heather Wilkinson** with death cap mushrooms in a beef Wellington, also attempting to murder **Ian Wilkinson**.\\n\\n**Patterson** maintains her innocence, claiming the poisoning was a tragic accident involving foraged mushrooms mixed with store-bought ones. However, her disposal of a food dehydrator after the deaths, and evidence suggesting she researched and weighed fatal doses of the fungi, are proving difficult to explain away. The defense, led by **Colin Mandy SC**, is working to portray these actions as those of a panicked, not malicious, individual. The conflicting testimonies, particularly regarding whether **Patterson** explicitly claimed to have cancer, and the interpretation of her social media messages, are central to the jury\\'s eventual deliberation.\\n\\nThis case, beyond the grim details, hinges on intent. The prosecution is building a narrative of calculated deception, while the defense paints a picture of unfortunate misadventure compounded by poor judgment under pressure. The outcome will rest heavily on the jury\\'s assessment of **Patterson\\'s** credibility, which has been significantly damaged by her own admissions of dishonesty.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**Trump Tightens Borders, Targets Harvard in New Immigration Crackdown**</u>\\nPresident **Trump** has enacted a new, sweeping travel ban, restricting entry from 12 nations and partially limiting it from seven others, citing national security and visa overstay rates. The affected countries include **Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen**, among others. This move, effective **June 9, 2025**, is a clear echo of his first-term policies and fulfills a campaign promise to tighten immigration controls.\\n\\nConcurrently, the administration has escalated its feud with **Harvard University**, suspending foreign student visas for six months. The official justification points to alleged failures by **Harvard** to address antisemitism and concerns over its foreign ties, including a supposed lack of cooperation with DHS inquiries. **Harvard President Alan M. Garber** has denounced the action as retaliatory and an illegal attempt to control the university\\'s governance and ideology.\\n\\nThese twin actions signal a renewed assertiveness on immigration and a willingness to use federal power against institutions perceived as oppositional. While supporters laud the measures as necessary for national security, critics and human rights groups decry them as discriminatory and politically motivated. Legal challenges are almost certain, particularly against the Harvard visa restrictions, which the university frames as a First Amendment violation. The administration appears to be betting that national security arguments will carry the day, much as they did, eventually, with previous travel ban iterations. The inclusion of exemptions for athletes participating in upcoming international events like the **World Cup** and **Olympics** is a pragmatic, if somewhat incongruous, footnote.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**Transatlantic Tensions: US Presses Germany on Defense, Nord Stream 2 Lingers, Iran Talks Complicate**</u>\\nRelations between Washington and Berlin are showing familiar strains. President **Trump** is again pressing **German Chancellor Friedrich Merz** and other NATO allies to significantly increase defense spending, now demanding a formidable 5% of GDP. This comes as **US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth** bluntly told allies to end their \"reliance\" on the United States. **Merz**, relatively new in office, is attempting to navigate these demands while asserting European interests and committing to making the **Bundeswehr** the \"strongest conventional army in Europe,\" though financing for this ambition beyond 2027 remains vague.\\n\\nThe ghost of **Nord Stream 2** also resurfaced, with an American investor, **Stephen P. Lynch**, pitching German officials on a plan to buy and activate the sabotaged pipeline. This adds another layer to the already complex energy security debate in Europe. Simultaneously, **Trump** has floated the idea that **Vladimir Putin** could assist in Iran nuclear negotiations, a suggestion that will raise eyebrows across European capitals given Russia\\'s deepened strategic partnership with **Tehran** and the ongoing war in **Ukraine**. **Iran\\'s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei** recently rejected the latest US proposal on its nuclear program, further complicating the diplomatic landscape.\\n\\nThe confluence of these issues – defense burden-sharing, energy infrastructure, and approaches to **Iran** and **Russia** – underscores the deep-seated divergences in strategic priorities and methods between the **Trump** administration and key European allies like **Germany**. **Merz** faces a difficult balancing act: maintaining a functional relationship with Washington while resisting policies perceived as detrimental to German or European sovereignty and economic interests, such as tariffs, which he stated \"benefit no one and damage everyone.\" The White House\\'s reported concerns about \"democratic backsliding\" in **Germany**, a claim **Merz** has pushed back against, only adds to the friction.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**UK Labour Government: Economic Promises Meet Fiscal Realities, Social Policy Debates Simmer**</u>\\nThe **UK Labour government**, led by **Prime Minister Keir Starmer**, is finding the transition from opposition to governance fraught with challenges. **Chancellor Rachel Reeves** is under scrutiny for perceived U-turns, notably on winter fuel payments, and faces internal party pressure regarding spending commitments, particularly concerning net zero policies championed by **Energy Secretary Ed Miliband**. The government did announce a £15.6 billion investment in transport for the North and Midlands, a move aimed at fulfilling promises of regional growth.\\n\\nOn the social front, an expansion of free school meals to all children on Universal Credit from September 2026 has been announced, a policy the government claims will lift 100,000 children out of poverty. However, the **Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS)** has cast doubt on this figure. Meanwhile, **Shadow Chancellor Mel Stride** is attempting to detoxify the Conservative brand by distancing the party from the economic chaos of the **Liz Truss** era, vowing fiscal credibility while criticizing **Reform UK\\'s** economic proposals as \"pure populism.\"\\n\\nThe Labour administration, despite its large majority secured last summer, appears to be wrestling with the classic dilemma of ambitious policy goals versus fiscal constraints and the political fallout from difficult choices. The upcoming Spending Review, where **Reeves** is expected to detail the winter fuel payment adjustments, will be a key test. The government\\'s ability to deliver on its promises, particularly in the North, and navigate internal party differences will be crucial for its long-term stability and public trust.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**Trump Initiates Probe into Biden\\'s Cognitive State and Autopen Use**</u>\\nPresident **Trump** has directed an investigation into former President **Joe Biden\\'s** cognitive health during his term and the alleged use of an autopen to sign official documents. **Trump** claims a \"conspiracy\" existed to conceal **Biden\\'s** mental state, suggesting that if **Biden\\'s** advisors secretly used the autopen due to his incapacity, it would represent an \"unconstitutional wielding of the power of the Presidency.\" The investigation is to be led by the White House counsel and **Attorney General Pam Bondi**.\\n\\n**Joe Biden** has dismissed the probe as a \"distraction,\" asserting he made all decisions during his presidency. This White House investigation runs parallel to an existing inquiry by the **House Oversight Committee**, chaired by Republican **James Comer**, which is also examining **Biden\\'s** mental fitness and has subpoenaed **Biden\\'s** physician, **Dr. Kevin O\\'Connor**.\\n\\nThe use of autopens by presidents is not unprecedented; a 2005 Justice Department memo under **George W. Bush** affirmed its legality for signing bills. However, **Trump\\'s** framing links the autopen use directly to alleged cognitive decline, aiming to cast doubt on the validity of actions taken during **Biden\\'s** term, including pre-emptive pardons **Trump** claims **Biden** signed for members of Congress involved in the January 6th investigation. This investigation is undeniably political, designed to undermine **Biden\\'s** legacy and fuel ongoing partisan narratives. While the legal standing of challenging past executive actions based on these grounds is debatable, the political impact is immediate.\\n\\n## United Kingdom focus\\n\\n<u>**Nintendo Switch 2 Arrives in UK Stores, Accessory Ecosystem Takes Shape**</u>\\nThe much-anticipated **Nintendo Switch 2** officially launched worldwide on **June 5, 2025**, with UK gamers finding consoles available at major retailers like **Argos** and **Asda**. **Asda** confirmed availability of the **Mario Kart World** bundle in 80 of its UK stores, while **Argos** is offering click-and-collect and delivery options.\\n\\nAlongside the console, a suite of accessories has been released, including new **Joy-Con 2** controllers and an updated **Pro Controller**. Notably, original **Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons** and **Pro Controllers** are compatible with the new hardware, offering a degree of continuity for existing Nintendo households. The extent of third-party controller compatibility remains slightly less clear, though the backward compatibility of first-party peripherals suggests a good chance for broader support.\\n\\nThe launch marks a significant moment for **Nintendo** and the gaming market. The success of the original Switch set a high bar, and the performance and reception of its successor will be closely watched. For UK consumers, the immediate focus is on availability and the initial software lineup, headlined by **Mario Kart World**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**By-Election in Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse Tests Scottish Political Waters**</u>\\nVoters in the **Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse** constituency are heading to the polls today, **June 5, 2025**, for a by-election triggered by the unfortunate death of **SNP MSP Christina McKelvie** in March. Ten candidates are vying for the seat, with results anticipated in the early hours of tomorrow.\\n\\nThis by-election is seen as a significant barometer of the political climate in **Scotland**, less than a year before the scheduled **Scottish Parliament elections in May 2026**. The **SNP**, represented by **Katy Loudon**, will be looking to hold the seat, while other parties, including **Scottish Labour (Davy Russell)** and the **Scottish Conservatives (Richard Nelson)**, will be keen to gauge their standing. The campaign has not been without controversy, with **Reform UK** and its candidate **Ross Lambie** facing accusations of racism, drawing public criticism from figures like football legend **Graeme Souness**, who lambasted **Nigel Farage**.\\n\\nBeyond the horse race, the by-election provides a platform for local and national issues, with the state of the **NHS in Scotland** being a prominent concern for many voters. The outcome will be closely analyzed for any shifts in support that could indicate broader trends ahead of next year\\'s parliamentary contest.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**Wise Eyes US Listing as London\\'s Fintech Allure Tested; Dr. Martens Reboots Strategy**</u>\\nFintech giant **Wise** is exploring a primary stock market listing in the **United States**, a move that, if pursued, would be perceived as a significant blow to **London\\'s** prestige as a global fintech hub. The company, formerly **TransferWise**, stated a US listing could expand its investor pool and boost liquidity, while intending to maintain a secondary listing in **London**. This consideration comes as **Wise** reported a rise in profits.\\n\\nMeanwhile, iconic British footwear brand **Dr. Martens** announced a substantial drop in annual profits for the fiscal year ending **March 30, 2025**. In response, new **CEO Ije Nwokorie** unveiled a new strategy focused on broadening its product range beyond its classic boots, aiming to attract new shoppers and stabilize its US operations. The company expressed expectations of a return to profit growth in the current financial year.\\n\\nThese developments occur against a backdrop of other market movements: facilities services group **Mitie** announced a £366m takeover of **Marlowe**, a testing and compliance business, while **Glencore-backed Cobalt Holdings** pulled its London IPO plans. The potential **Wise** move, in particular, will fuel ongoing debate about the attractiveness of the **London Stock Exchange** for high-growth tech companies, despite government efforts to encourage such listings.\\n\\n## Global landscape\\n\\n<u>**EV Cargo Fire Off Alaska Coast Highlights Lithium-Ion Battery Risks at Sea**</u>\\nA significant fire has broken out on the **Morning Midas**, a cargo ship carrying approximately 3,000 vehicles, including 800 electric vehicles (EVs), off the coast of **Alaska**. The 22 crew members were safely rescued after abandoning ship. The **US Coast Guard** has made the decision to allow the fire to burn itself out, citing the considerable risk of exploding lithium-ion batteries if water were used in an attempt to extinguish the blaze.\\n\\nThe fire is believed to have originated on a deck where EVs were stored. This incident immediately brings to mind the 2022 **Felicity Ace** disaster, where a similar car carrier laden with luxury vehicles, including EVs, caught fire and eventually sank, also due to uncontrollable lithium-ion battery fires. The **Morning Midas**, operated by UK-based **Zodiac Maritime**, was en route from **Yantai, China**, to **Lazaro Cardenas, Mexico**.\\n\\nThis event underscores the persistent and growing challenges associated with the maritime transport of EVs. Lithium-ion battery fires are notoriously difficult to manage, especially in the confined spaces of a cargo vessel and when exposed to saltwater. The incident will likely intensify scrutiny of safety protocols, ship design, and insurance practices for the burgeoning EV shipping industry.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**Hurricane Season Kicks Off: Jamaica Ramps Up Prep, US Forecasters Face Budget Squeeze**</u>\\nAs the **2025 Atlantic hurricane season** officially commenced on **June 1**, preparations are in sharp focus across vulnerable regions. In **Jamaica**, still mindful of the impact of **Hurricane Beryl** in 2024, **Prime Minister Andrew Holness** outlined government efforts to bolster disaster response plans. These include strengthening infrastructure resilience, improving early warning systems, and enhancing community-level capacity, with the **Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM)** distributing hurricane straps and inspecting shelters.\\n\\nConversely, in **Florida**, concerns are mounting over the potential impact of budget cuts on the accuracy of weather forecasting. **Meteorologist John Morales** of **NBC 6 South Florida** issued a stark warning that reductions in funding for the **National Weather Service (NWS)** and the **National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)**, attributed in part to **Trump** administration policies, are degrading forecast quality. This, he cautioned, could leave meteorologists \"flying blind\" during what is predicted to be an above-average hurricane season, potentially leading to \"needless loss of life.\"\\n\\nThe contrast highlights a critical disparity: while some nations are actively investing to mitigate hurricane risks, others may be undermining their own preparedness through fiscal decisions. With experts forecasting heightened storm activity, the adequacy of forecasting and response mechanisms will be severely tested in the months ahead.\\n\\n## Superpower monitor\\n\\n<u>**Wrongfully Deported Guatemalan Man Returned to US After Court Intervention**</u>\\nA Guatemalan man, identified only as **O.C.G.**, who was wrongfully deported to **Mexico** by the **Trump administration** despite expressing clear fears of persecution, has been returned to the **United States**. His return on **June 4, 2025**, followed a court order from **U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy**, compelling the administration to facilitate his re-entry.\\n\\nThe **Justice Department** initially, and incorrectly, claimed that **O.C.G.** had stated he was not afraid of being sent to **Mexico**. This assertion was later retracted. **O.C.G.**, who sought asylum in the U.S. due to violence in **Guatemala** and subsequent rape and extortion in **Mexico**, will remain in **ICE** custody in **Arizona** while his case is reviewed. His attorney, **Trina Realmuto** of the **National Immigration Litigation Alliance**, is representing him.\\n\\nThis case underscores the potential for significant errors and due process violations within the U.S. deportation system. It also highlights the tangible dangers faced by asylum seekers returned to countries where their safety is compromised. While the administration complied with the court order, the initial deportation and the erroneous justification provided raise serious questions about the handling of such sensitive cases. The outcome of **O.C.G.\\'s** asylum claim remains uncertain, but his return marks a small victory for legal advocates challenging deportation practices.\\n</brief>\\n\\nCreate a title for the brief.

Here’s what’s moving the needle.\\n\\n## Main Stories\\n\\n<u>**Mushroom Trial: Patterson\\'s Credibility Under Fire as Deception Allegations Mount**</u>\\nThe **Erin Patterson** mushroom poisoning trial in **Victoria, Australia**, is intensifying. The prosecution, led by **Nanette Rogers SC**, is relentlessly cross-examining **Patterson**, focusing on her admitted lies to police and alleged fabrications, including a supposed cancer diagnosis used to lure the victims to the fatal lunch. The core of the Crown\\'s case is that **Patterson** deliberately poisoned her estranged husband\\'s parents, **Don** and **Gail Patterson**, and **Heather Wilkinson** with death cap mushrooms in a beef Wellington, also attempting to murder **Ian Wilkinson**.\\n\\n**Patterson** maintains her innocence, claiming the poisoning was a tragic accident involving foraged mushrooms mixed with store-bought ones. However, her disposal of a food dehydrator after the deaths, and evidence suggesting she researched and weighed fatal doses of the fungi, are proving difficult to explain away. The defense, led by **Colin Mandy SC**, is working to portray these actions as those of a panicked, not malicious, individual. The conflicting testimonies, particularly regarding whether **Patterson** explicitly claimed to have cancer, and the interpretation of her social media messages, are central to the jury\\'s eventual deliberation.\\n\\nThis case, beyond the grim details, hinges on intent. The prosecution is building a narrative of calculated deception, while the defense paints a picture of unfortunate misadventure compounded by poor judgment under pressure. The outcome will rest heavily on the jury\\'s assessment of **Patterson\\'s** credibility, which has been significantly damaged by her own admissions of dishonesty.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**Trump Tightens Borders, Targets Harvard in New Immigration Crackdown**</u>\\nPresident **Trump** has enacted a new, sweeping travel ban, restricting entry from 12 nations and partially limiting it from seven others, citing national security and visa overstay rates. The affected countries include **Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen**, among others. This move, effective **June 9, 2025**, is a clear echo of his first-term policies and fulfills a campaign promise to tighten immigration controls.\\n\\nConcurrently, the administration has escalated its feud with **Harvard University**, suspending foreign student visas for six months. The official justification points to alleged failures by **Harvard** to address antisemitism and concerns over its foreign ties, including a supposed lack of cooperation with DHS inquiries. **Harvard President Alan M. Garber** has denounced the action as retaliatory and an illegal attempt to control the university\\'s governance and ideology.\\n\\nThese twin actions signal a renewed assertiveness on immigration and a willingness to use federal power against institutions perceived as oppositional. While supporters laud the measures as necessary for national security, critics and human rights groups decry them as discriminatory and politically motivated. Legal challenges are almost certain, particularly against the Harvard visa restrictions, which the university frames as a First Amendment violation. The administration appears to be betting that national security arguments will carry the day, much as they did, eventually, with previous travel ban iterations. The inclusion of exemptions for athletes participating in upcoming international events like the **World Cup** and **Olympics** is a pragmatic, if somewhat incongruous, footnote.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**Transatlantic Tensions: US Presses Germany on Defense, Nord Stream 2 Lingers, Iran Talks Complicate**</u>\\nRelations between Washington and Berlin are showing familiar strains. President **Trump** is again pressing **German Chancellor Friedrich Merz** and other NATO allies to significantly increase defense spending, now demanding a formidable 5% of GDP. This comes as **US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth** bluntly told allies to end their \"reliance\" on the United States. **Merz**, relatively new in office, is attempting to navigate these demands while asserting European interests and committing to making the **Bundeswehr** the \"strongest conventional army in Europe,\" though financing for this ambition beyond 2027 remains vague.\\n\\nThe ghost of **Nord Stream 2** also resurfaced, with an American investor, **Stephen P. Lynch**, pitching German officials on a plan to buy and activate the sabotaged pipeline. This adds another layer to the already complex energy security debate in Europe. Simultaneously, **Trump** has floated the idea that **Vladimir Putin** could assist in Iran nuclear negotiations, a suggestion that will raise eyebrows across European capitals given Russia\\'s deepened strategic partnership with **Tehran** and the ongoing war in **Ukraine**. **Iran\\'s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei** recently rejected the latest US proposal on its nuclear program, further complicating the diplomatic landscape.\\n\\nThe confluence of these issues – defense burden-sharing, energy infrastructure, and approaches to **Iran** and **Russia** – underscores the deep-seated divergences in strategic priorities and methods between the **Trump** administration and key European allies like **Germany**. **Merz** faces a difficult balancing act: maintaining a functional relationship with Washington while resisting policies perceived as detrimental to German or European sovereignty and economic interests, such as tariffs, which he stated \"benefit no one and damage everyone.\" The White House\\'s reported concerns about \"democratic backsliding\" in **Germany**, a claim **Merz** has pushed back against, only adds to the friction.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**UK Labour Government: Economic Promises Meet Fiscal Realities, Social Policy Debates Simmer**</u>\\nThe **UK Labour government**, led by **Prime Minister Keir Starmer**, is finding the transition from opposition to governance fraught with challenges. **Chancellor Rachel Reeves** is under scrutiny for perceived U-turns, notably on winter fuel payments, and faces internal party pressure regarding spending commitments, particularly concerning net zero policies championed by **Energy Secretary Ed Miliband**.

This assertion was later retracted. **O.C.G.**, who sought asylum in the U.S. due to violence in **Guatemala** and subsequent rape and extortion in **Mexico**, will remain in **ICE** custody in **Arizona** while his case is reviewed. His attorney, **Trina Realmuto** of the **National Immigration Litigation Alliance**, is representing him.\\n\\nThis case underscores the potential for significant errors and due process violations within the U.S. deportation system. It also highlights the tangible dangers faced by asylum seekers returned to countries where their safety is compromised. While the administration complied with the court order, the initial deportation and the erroneous justification provided raise serious questions about the handling of such sensitive cases. The outcome of **O.C.G.\\'s** asylum claim remains uncertain, but his return marks a small victory for legal advocates challenging deportation practices.\\n</final_brief>\\n\\n**Required Output Format:**\\n\\nYour entire output must consist **only** of a list of summaries, one for each identified major story.

      "# Mushroom Trial, Trump's Immigration Crackdown, US-German Tensions & UK Labour's Challenges\n",
      "\n",
      "Alright, let's cut through the noise. Here’s what’s moving the needle.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Main Stories\n",
      "\n",
      "<u>**Mushroom Trial: Patterson's Credibility Under Fire as Deception Allegations Mount**</u>\n",
      "The **Erin Patterson** mushroom poisoning trial in **Victoria, Australia**, is intensifying. The prosecution, led by **Nanette Rogers SC**, is relentlessly cross-examining **Patterson**, focusing on her admitted lies to police and alleged fabrications, including a supposed cancer diagnosis used to lure the victims to the fatal lunch. The core of the Crown's case is that **Patterson** deliberately poisoned her estranged husband's parents, **Don** and **Gail Patterson**, and **Heather Wilkinson** with death cap mushrooms in a beef Wellington, also attempting to murder **Ian Wilkinson**.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Patterson** maintains her innocence, claiming the poisoning was a tragic accident involving foraged mushrooms mixed with store-bought ones. However, her disposal of a food dehydrator after the deaths, and evidence suggesting she researched and weighed fatal doses of the fungi, are proving difficult to explain away. The defense, led by **Colin Mandy SC**, is working to portray these actions as those of a panicked, not malicious, individual. The conflicting testimonies, particularly regarding whether **Patterson** explicitly claimed to have cancer, and the interpretation of her social media messages, are central to the jury's eventual deliberation.\n",
      "\n",
      "This case, beyond the grim details, hinges on intent. The prosecution is building a narrative of calculated deception, while the defense paints a picture of unfortunate misadventure compounded by poor judgment under pressure. The outcome will rest heavily on the jury's assessment of **Patterson's** credibility, which has been significantly damaged by her own admissions of dishonesty.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "<u>**Trump Tightens Borders, Targets Harvard in New Immigration Crackdown**</u>\n",
      "President **Trump** has enacted a new, sweeping travel ban, restricting entry from 12 nations and partially limiting it from seven others, citing national security and visa overstay rates. The affected countries include **Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen**, among others. This move, effective **June 9, 2025**, is a clear echo of his first-term policies and fulfills a campaign promise to tighten immigration controls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Concurrently, the administration has escalated its feud with **Harvard University**, suspending foreign student visas for six months. The official justification points to alleged failures by **Harvard** to address antisemitism and concerns over its foreign ties, including a supposed lack of cooperation with DHS inquiries. **Harvard President Alan M. Garber** has denounced the action as retaliatory and an illegal attempt to control the university's governance and ideology.\n",
      "\n",
      "These twin actions signal a renewed assertiveness on immigration and a willingness to use federal power against institutions perceived as oppositional. While supporters laud the measures as necessary for national security, critics and human rights groups decry them as discriminatory and politically motivated. Legal challenges are almost certain, particularly against the Harvard visa restrictions, which the university frames as a First Amendment violation. The administration appears to be betting that national security arguments will carry the day, much as they did, eventually, with previous travel ban iterations. The inclusion of exemptions for athletes participating in upcoming international events like the **World Cup** and **Olympics** is a pragmatic, if somewhat incongruous, footnote.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "<u>**Transatlantic Tensions: US Presses Germany on Defense, Nord Stream 2 Lingers, Iran Talks Complicate**</u>\n",
      "Relations between Washington and Berlin are showing familiar strains. President **Trump** is again pressing **German Chancellor Friedrich Merz** and other NATO allies to significantly increase defense spending, now demanding a formidable 5% of GDP. This comes as **US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth** bluntly told allies to end their \"reliance\" on the United States. **Merz**, relatively new in office, is attempting to navigate these demands while asserting European interests and committing to making the **Bundeswehr** the \"strongest conventional army in Europe,\" though financing for this ambition beyond 2027 remains vague.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ghost of **Nord Stream 2** also resurfaced, with an American investor, **Stephen P. Lynch**, pitching German officials on a plan to buy and activate the sabotaged pipeline. This adds another layer to the already complex energy security debate in Europe. Simultaneously, **Trump** has floated the idea that **Vladimir Putin** could assist in Iran nuclear negotiations, a suggestion that will raise eyebrows across European capitals given Russia's deepened strategic partnership with **Tehran** and the ongoing war in **Ukraine**. **Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei** recently rejected the latest US proposal on its nuclear program, further complicating the diplomatic landscape.\n",
      "\n",
      "The confluence of these issues – defense burden-sharing, energy infrastructure, and approaches to **Iran** and **Russia** – underscores the deep-seated divergences in strategic priorities and methods between the **Trump** administration and key European allies like **Germany**. **Merz** faces a difficult balancing act: maintaining a functional relationship with Washington while resisting policies perceived as detrimental to German or European sovereignty and economic interests, such as tariffs, which he stated \"benefit no one and damage everyone.\" The White House's reported concerns about \"democratic backsliding\" in **Germany**, a claim **Merz** has pushed back against, only adds to the friction.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "<u>**UK Labour Government: Economic Promises Meet Fiscal Realities, Social Policy Debates Simmer**</u>\n",
      "The **UK Labour government**, led by **Prime Minister Keir Starmer**, is finding the transition from opposition to governance fraught with challenges. **Chancellor Rachel Reeves** is under scrutiny for perceived U-turns, notably on winter fuel payments, and faces internal party pressure regarding spending commitments, particularly concerning net zero policies championed by **Energy Secretary Ed Miliband**. The government did announce a £15.6 billion investment in transport for the North and Midlands, a move aimed at fulfilling promises of regional growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the social front, an expansion of free school meals to all children on Universal Credit from September 2026 has been announced, a policy the government claims will lift 100,000 children out of poverty. However, the **Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS)** has cast doubt on this figure. Meanwhile, **Shadow Chancellor Mel Stride** is attempting to detoxify the Conservative brand by distancing the party from the economic chaos of the **Liz Truss** era, vowing fiscal credibility while criticizing **Reform UK's** economic proposals as \"pure populism.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Labour administration, despite its large majority secured last summer, appears to be wrestling with the classic dilemma of ambitious policy goals versus fiscal constraints and the political fallout from difficult choices. The upcoming Spending Review, where **Reeves** is expected to detail the winter fuel payment adjustments, will be a key test. The government's ability to deliver on its promises, particularly in the North, and navigate internal party differences will be crucial for its long-term stability and public trust.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "<u>**Trump Initiates Probe into Biden's Cognitive State and Autopen Use**</u>\n",
      "President **Trump** has directed an investigation into former President **Joe Biden's** cognitive health during his term and the alleged use of an autopen to sign official documents. **Trump** claims a \"conspiracy\" existed to conceal **Biden's** mental state, suggesting that if **Biden's** advisors secretly used the autopen due to his incapacity, it would represent an \"unconstitutional wielding of the power of the Presidency.\" The investigation is to be led by the White House counsel and **Attorney General Pam Bondi**.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Joe Biden** has dismissed the probe as a \"distraction,\" asserting he made all decisions during his presidency. This White House investigation runs parallel to an existing inquiry by the **House Oversight Committee**, chaired by Republican **James Comer**, which is also examining **Biden's** mental fitness and has subpoenaed **Biden's** physician, **Dr. Kevin O'Connor**.\n",
      "\n",
      "The use of autopens by presidents is not unprecedented; a 2005 Justice Department memo under **George W. Bush** affirmed its legality for signing bills. However, **Trump's** framing links the autopen use directly to alleged cognitive decline, aiming to cast doubt on the validity of actions taken during **Biden's** term, including pre-emptive pardons **Trump** claims **Biden** signed for members of Congress involved in the January 6th investigation. This investigation is undeniably political, designed to undermine **Biden's** legacy and fuel ongoing partisan narratives. While the legal standing of challenging past executive actions based on these grounds is debatable, the political impact is immediate.\n",

      "<u>**Nintendo Switch 2 Arrives in UK Stores, Accessory Ecosystem Takes Shape**</u>\n",
      "The much-anticipated **Nintendo Switch 2** officially launched worldwide on **June 5, 2025**, with UK gamers finding consoles available at major retailers like **Argos** and **Asda**. **Asda** confirmed availability of the **Mario Kart World** bundle in 80 of its UK stores, while **Argos** is offering click-and-collect and delivery options.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alongside the console, a suite of accessories has been released, including new **Joy-Con 2** controllers and an updated **Pro Controller**. Notably, original **Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons** and **Pro Controllers** are compatible with the new hardware, offering a degree of continuity for existing Nintendo households. The extent of third-party controller compatibility remains slightly less clear, though the backward compatibility of first-party peripherals suggests a good chance for broader support.\n",
      "\n",
      "The launch marks a significant moment for **Nintendo** and the gaming market. The success of the original Switch set a high bar, and the performance and reception of its successor will be closely watched. For UK consumers, the immediate focus is on availability and the initial software lineup, headlined by **Mario Kart World**.\n",

      "Voters in the **Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse** constituency are heading to the polls today, **June 5, 2025**, for a by-election triggered by the unfortunate death of **SNP MSP Christina McKelvie** in March. Ten candidates are vying for the seat, with results anticipated in the early hours of tomorrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "This by-election is seen as a significant barometer of the political climate in **Scotland**, less than a year before the scheduled **Scottish Parliament elections in May 2026**. The **SNP**, represented by **Katy Loudon**, will be looking to hold the seat, while other parties, including **Scottish Labour (Davy Russell)** and the **Scottish Conservatives (Richard Nelson)**, will be keen to gauge their standing. The campaign has not been without controversy, with **Reform UK** and its candidate **Ross Lambie** facing accusations of racism, drawing public criticism from figures like football legend **Graeme Souness**, who lambasted **Nigel Farage**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond the horse race, the by-election provides a platform for local and national issues, with the state of the **NHS in Scotland** being a prominent concern for many voters. The outcome will be closely analyzed for any shifts in support that could indicate broader trends ahead of next year's parliamentary contest.\n",

      "Fintech giant **Wise** is exploring a primary stock market listing in the **United States**, a move that, if pursued, would be perceived as a significant blow to **London's** prestige as a global fintech hub. The company, formerly **TransferWise**, stated a US listing could expand its investor pool and boost liquidity, while intending to maintain a secondary listing in **London**. This consideration comes as **Wise** reported a rise in profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, iconic British footwear brand **Dr. Martens** announced a substantial drop in annual profits for the fiscal year ending **March 30, 2025**. In response, new **CEO Ije Nwokorie** unveiled a new strategy focused on broadening its product range beyond its classic boots, aiming to attract new shoppers and stabilize its US operations. The company expressed expectations of a return to profit growth in the current financial year.\n",
      "\n",
      "These developments occur against a backdrop of other market movements: facilities services group **Mitie** announced a £366m takeover of **Marlowe**, a testing and compliance business, while **Glencore-backed Cobalt Holdings** pulled its London IPO plans. The potential **Wise** move, in particular, will fuel ongoing debate about the attractiveness of the **London Stock Exchange** for high-growth tech companies, despite government efforts to encourage such listings.\n",

      "A significant fire has broken out on the **Morning Midas**, a cargo ship carrying approximately 3,000 vehicles, including 800 electric vehicles (EVs), off the coast of **Alaska**. The 22 crew members were safely rescued after abandoning ship. The **US Coast Guard** has made the decision to allow the fire to burn itself out, citing the considerable risk of exploding lithium-ion batteries if water were used in an attempt to extinguish the blaze.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fire is believed to have originated on a deck where EVs were stored. This incident immediately brings to mind the 2022 **Felicity Ace** disaster, where a similar car carrier laden with luxury vehicles, including EVs, caught fire and eventually sank, also due to uncontrollable lithium-ion battery fires. The **Morning Midas**, operated by UK-based **Zodiac Maritime**, was en route from **Yantai, China**, to **Lazaro Cardenas, Mexico**.\n",
      "\n",
      "This event underscores the persistent and growing challenges associated with the maritime transport of EVs. Lithium-ion battery fires are notoriously difficult to manage, especially in the confined spaces of a cargo vessel and when exposed to saltwater. The incident will likely intensify scrutiny of safety protocols, ship design, and insurance practices for the burgeoning EV shipping industry.\n",

      "As the **2025 Atlantic hurricane season** officially commenced on **June 1**, preparations are in sharp focus across vulnerable regions. In **Jamaica**, still mindful of the impact of **Hurricane Beryl** in 2024, **Prime Minister Andrew Holness** outlined government efforts to bolster disaster response plans. These include strengthening infrastructure resilience, improving early warning systems, and enhancing community-level capacity, with the **Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM)** distributing hurricane straps and inspecting shelters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conversely, in **Florida**, concerns are mounting over the potential impact of budget cuts on the accuracy of weather forecasting. **Meteorologist John Morales** of **NBC 6 South Florida** issued a stark warning that reductions in funding for the **National Weather Service (NWS)** and the **National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)**, attributed in part to **Trump** administration policies, are degrading forecast quality. This, he cautioned, could leave meteorologists \"flying blind\" during what is predicted to be an above-average hurricane season, potentially leading to \"needless loss of life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The contrast highlights a critical disparity: while some nations are actively investing to mitigate hurricane risks, others may be undermining their own preparedness through fiscal decisions. With experts forecasting heightened storm activity, the adequacy of forecasting and response mechanisms will be severely tested in the months ahead.\n",

      "<u>**Wrongfully Deported Guatemalan Man Returned to US After Court Intervention**</u>\n",
      "A Guatemalan man, identified only as **O.C.G.**, who was wrongfully deported to **Mexico** by the **Trump administration** despite expressing clear fears of persecution, has been returned to the **United States**. His return on **June 4, 2025**, followed a court order from **U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy**, compelling the administration to facilitate his re-entry.\n",
      "\n",
      "The **Justice Department** initially, and incorrectly, claimed that **O.C.G.** had stated he was not afraid of being sent to **Mexico**. This assertion was later retracted. **O.C.G.**, who sought asylum in the U.S. due to violence in **Guatemala** and subsequent rape and extortion in **Mexico**, will remain in **ICE** custody in **Arizona** while his case is reviewed. His attorney, **Trina Realmuto** of the **National Immigration Litigation Alliance**, is representing him.\n",
      "\n",
      "This case underscores the potential for significant errors and due process violations within the U.S. deportation system. It also highlights the tangible dangers faced by asylum seekers returned to countries where their safety is compromised. While the administration complied with the court order, the initial deportation and the erroneous justification provided raise serious questions about the handling of such sensitive cases. The outcome of **O.C.G.'s** asylum claim remains uncertain, but his return marks a small victory for legal advocates challenging deportation practices.\n"
