      "Sending converted contents format: [{'role': 'user', 'parts': [{'text': 'You are an expert news analyst AI tasked with refining a set of automatically generated news clusters. You will receive a list of clusters, each identified by an ID, a title, and a list of associated article titles.\\n\\nYour primary goal is to identify clusters that should be **merged** because they represent different facets or developments of the *same core story or event*, rather than distinct narratives. Use the following rule of thumb: **\"If analyzing the articles in Cluster A would feel incomplete or artificially separated from the articles in Cluster B because they fundamentally describe the same specific event, ongoing situation, or central topic, they should be merged.\"**\\n\\nDistinguish this from clusters that are merely *related* thematically but cover different specific events, angles, or sub-topics that *can* stand alone as separate stories, even if they might be linked later in analysis. For example:\\n\\n*   **Merge Candidate Example:** Cluster 1 covers the initial report of a factory fire. Cluster 2 covers the emergency response and evacuation related to *that same fire*. Cluster 3 covers the investigation into the cause of *that same fire*. These are facets of the *same core story* (the factory fire event) and should likely be merged.\\n*   **Keep Separate Example:** Cluster 1 covers a new trade agreement signed between Country X and Country Y. Cluster 2 covers protests *within* Country X about the economic impact of *that trade agreement*. While related, the signing event and the domestic protest are distinct stories/angles that could be analyzed separately. Cluster 3 covers a *different* trade dispute Country X has with Country Z – clearly a separate story.\\n\\nYour secondary goal is to identify clusters that should be **filtered out** before further processing. **Filtering should be used sparingly**, primarily to remove noise and maintain data quality, not to judge the importance of a story. The aim is to retain a record of all distinct, coherent events, even routine or smaller ones. Filter *only* if a cluster meets one of these specific criteria:\\n*   **Very Low Article Count:** Contains **fewer than 3 articles**, indicating it likely doesn\\'t represent a sufficiently developed or distinct event captured in the data.\\n*   **Incoherent or Noise:** The articles within the cluster do not form a coherent topic, or the cluster appears to be noise/junk data.\\n*   **Strict Duplicate:** The cluster covers the *exact same specific event* as another cluster, often with significant overlap in articles, making it redundant.

    "You are an expert news analyst AI tasked with refining a set of automatically generated news clusters. You will receive a list of clusters, each identified by an ID, a title, and a list of associated article titles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your primary goal is to identify clusters that should be **merged** because they represent different facets or developments of the *same core story or event*, rather than distinct narratives. Use the following rule of thumb: **\"If analyzing the articles in Cluster A would feel incomplete or artificially separated from the articles in Cluster B because they fundamentally describe the same specific event, ongoing situation, or central topic, they should be merged.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "Distinguish this from clusters that are merely *related* thematically but cover different specific events, angles, or sub-topics that *can* stand alone as separate stories, even if they might be linked later in analysis. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Merge Candidate Example:** Cluster 1 covers the initial report of a factory fire. Cluster 2 covers the emergency response and evacuation related to *that same fire*. Cluster 3 covers the investigation into the cause of *that same fire*. These are facets of the *same core story* (the factory fire event) and should likely be merged.\n",
    "*   **Keep Separate Example:** Cluster 1 covers a new trade agreement signed between Country X and Country Y. Cluster 2 covers protests *within* Country X about the economic impact of *that trade agreement*. While related, the signing event and the domestic protest are distinct stories/angles that could be analyzed separately. Cluster 3 covers a *different* trade dispute Country X has with Country Z – clearly a separate story.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your secondary goal is to identify clusters that should be **filtered out** before further processing. **Filtering should be used sparingly**, primarily to remove noise and maintain data quality, not to judge the importance of a story. The aim is to retain a record of all distinct, coherent events, even routine or smaller ones. Filter *only* if a cluster meets one of these specific criteria:\n",
    "*   **Very Low Article Count:** Contains **fewer than 3 articles**, indicating it likely doesn't represent a sufficiently developed or distinct event captured in the data.\n",
    "*   **Incoherent or Noise:** The articles within the cluster do not form a coherent topic, or the cluster appears to be noise/junk data.\n",
    "*   **Strict Duplicate:** The cluster covers the *exact same specific event* as another cluster, often with significant overlap in articles, making it redundant. (Do not filter merely *related* clusters).\n",

    "    *   `cluster_id_to_filter`: A string representing the original Cluster ID to be filtered out.\n",
    "    *   `reason`: A brief string explaining the justification, strictly based on the filtering criteria above (e.g., \"Fewer than 3 articles\", \"Incoherent topic/Noise\", \"Duplicate of Cluster X\", \"Irrelevant content\").\n",

Features include camera controls that let you create precisely the kind of shot you’re after, bringing direct control of camera motion, angles, and perspectives.\\nOther Flow features include scenebuilder, which lets you seamlessly edit and extend your existing shots, so you can reveal more of the action or smoothly transition to what happens next with continuous motion and consistent characters.\\nGoogle’s new AI tool is a wake-up call for OpenAI’s Sora, which is one of Flow’s high-profile competitors. Both are designed for filmmakers and creatives to generate cinematic video scenes from text prompts, but Flow distinguishes itself by integrating native audio generation.\\nEstablished creatives and those on film crews will be looking at these new tools with some trepidation, with Google’s latest AI-powered content creation products having even greater potential to disrupt traditional filmmaking, advertising, and similar industries. But some filmmakers are embracing the profound changes heading their way, with Oscar-nominated director Darren Aronofsky, for one, announcing a partnership with Google for a new generative-AI storytelling initiative to create short films using some of Google’s newly announced tools, IndieWire reported.\\n“Filmmaking has always been driven by technology,” Aronofsky said in a statement. “After the Lumiere Brothers and Edison’s ground-breaking invention, filmmakers unleashed the hidden storytelling power of cameras. Later technological breakthroughs — sound, color, VFX — allowed us to tell stories in ways that couldn’t be told before. Today is no different. Now is the moment to explore these new tools and shape them for the future of storytelling.”\\nFlow is available today for Google AI Pro and Ultra plan subscribers in the U.S., with more countries coming soon.\\n```\\n\\n## [By putting AI into everything, Google wants to make it invisible](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/21/1117251/by-putting-ai-into-everything-google-wants-to-make-it-invisible/) (#33312)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 11:49:03+00:00\\n\\n```\\nYes, Google’s roster of consumer-facing products is the slickest on offer. The firm is bundling most of its multimodal models into its Gemini app, including the new Imagen 4 image generator and the new Veo 3 video generator. That means you can now access Google’s full range of generative models via a single chatbot. It also announced Gemini Live, a feature that lets you share your phone’s screen or your camera’s view with the chatbot and ask it about what it can see. Those features were previously only seen in demos of Project Astra, a “universal AI assistant“ that Google DeepMind is working on. Now, Google is inching toward putting Project Astra into the hands of anyone with a smartphone.\\nGoogle is also rolling out AI Mode, an LLM-powered front end to search. This can now pull in personal information from Gmail or Google Docs to tailor searches to users. It will include Deep Search, which can break a query down into hundreds of individual searches and then summarize the results; a version of Project Mariner, Google DeepMind’s browser-using agent; and Search Live, which lets you hold up your camera and ask it what it sees. This is the new frontier. It’s no longer about who has the most powerful models, but who can spin them into the best products. OpenAI’s ChatGPT includes many similar features to Gemini’s. But with its existing ecosystem of consumer services and billions of existing users, Google has a clear advantage. Power users wanting access to the latest versions of everything on display can now sign up for Google AI Ultra for $250 a month.\\nWhen OpenAI released ChatGPT in late 2022, Google was caught on the back foot and was forced to jump into higher gear to catch up. With this year’s product lineup, it looks as if Google has stuck its landing. On a preview call, CEO Sundar Pichai claimed that AI Overviews, a precursor to AI Mode that provides LLM-generated summaries of search results, had turned out to be popular with hundreds of millions of users. He speculated that many of them may not even know (or care) that they were using AI—it was just a cool new way to search. Google I/O gives a broader glimpse of that future, one where AI is invisible. “More intelligence is available, for everyone, everywhere,” Pichai told his audience. I think we are expected to marvel. But by putting AI in everything, Google is turning AI into a technology we won’t notice and may not even bother to name.\\n```\\n\\n## [My Jaw Dropped When Google Told Me How Its New AI Shopping Feature Handles Privacy](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/my-jaw-dropped-when-google-told-me-how-its-new-ai-shopping-feature-handles-privacy/#ftag=CAD590a51e) (#34140)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 15:06:44+00:00\\n\\n```\\nWhy You Can Trust CNET Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks.

Reviews ethics statement\\nCommentary: When I saw Google\\'s AI shopping feature that wants to be like Cher\\'s closet in Clueless, I had some serious questions. But I admit, Google surprised me.\\nKatelyn Chedraoui Writer I Katelyn is a writer with CNET covering social media, AI and online services. She graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a degree in media and journalism. You can often find her with a novel and an iced coffee during her time off. 3 min read An AI fashion tool was not on my Google I/O bucket list. At Google\\'s annual I/O developers conference, the company introduced a number of Gemini AI updates, many of which are coming to Search and, notably, to our online shopping experiences. The new AI shopping feature lets you virtually \"try on\" different articles of clothing by using a photo of your body and imagining what it may look like on you.\\xa0Google built a custom image-generation model to power its new feature. It\\'s a simple idea: Google\\'s AI takes the input image of your body and the input image of the garment and combines them. The actual process behind it is surely more complicated. But in the live demo, it seemed to work flawlessly. The virtual try-on feature is available today in the US, with more visual shopping and AI-agentic updates coming soon.I was very intrigued when I saw the live demo. I shop online for nearly everything I need, and I have been fooled many times by misimagining how clothing I see on models would look on me. But I\\'m an AI reporter, and I spend a lot of time worrying about the privacy implications of image and video tools, so I was skeptical, too.Read more:\\xa0Everything Announced at Google I/O 2025I contacted Google after the keynote to ask about the privacy policies around this new feature. A Google spokesperson said, \"Your uploaded photo is never used beyond trying things on virtually, nor is your photo used for training purposes. It is not shared with other Google products, services or third parties, and you can delete or replace it at any time.\"\\xa0I was jaw-droppingly, but pleasantly surprised by this. In the age of AI, tech companies are typically so data-hungry that a source of data like this seemed like a no-brainer for Google to use. Google spent a decent chunk of time during I/O showing off its new AI image and video tools, and human-generated photos like these would be useful for future model improvements.\\xa0 Tech and fashion companies have been trying to work on this problem for years -- my CNET colleague Katie Collins wrote about\\xa0one dress-sizing app\\xa0all the way back in 2012, and Amazon\\'s integrated AI for its\\xa0fashion sales\\xa0in recent years, too.\\xa0This fashion model, as Vidhya Srinivasan, Google\\'s vice president and general manager of ads and commerce, called it during the keynote, has \"a deep understanding of the human body.\" We\\'ll have to test it out to see if it really works for all body types and sizes. AI image generators, especially early ones from Google, aren\\'t always great when it comes to diversity. But I\\'m willing to give Google a chance since it states it won\\'t use my pictures to automatically train its AI models.As much as I want to believe Google has given us a 2025 version of Cher\\'s closet from Clueless, I\\'m still a little skeptical. There\\'s no guarantee that the AI version of yourself Google generates will actually reflect how the clothing looks on you in real life. But maybe this is a potentially good use of AI, instead of filling the internet with slop.\\n```\\n\\n## [Could the GPT Store Turn ChatGPT into a Platform Powerhouse?](https://hbr.org/2025/05/could-the-gpt-store-turn-chatgpt-into-a-platform-powerhouse) (#35130)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 12:15:28+00:00\\n\\n```\\nHarvard Business Review LogoMay 21, 2025HBR StaffChatGPT’s recent explosive growth has led some to believe that “network effects are kicking in.”\\xa0As it picks up users, it gains more data, which then helps it produce a better product (data network effects similar to those that power Google search but weaker in this case). And there’s increasingly shared benefit between users and builders of GPTs (cross-side network effects similar to the ones between iPhone users and app developers but, again, weaker).

The bad news is that Google is, too, making efforts to embed ads in those AI search results as well. Now, they\\'re being greatly expanded.\\nGoogle has announced expansions to its ad initiative throughout both AI Overviews as well as Google\\'s new AI-only search mode, AI Mode. AI Overviews already featured some ads, but now, Google announced that Search and Shopping ads within AI Overviews are expanding to desktop platforms in the US, starting today. Previously, these ads were mainly shown on mobile platforms whenever an AI Overview popped up in a search query, as long as the ad in question was relevant to the actual response. Looking ahead, the company plans to further extend ads in AI Overviews in English to select international markets on both mobile and desktop later this year—currently ads are only available in the US, but they might soon become as global as regular ads in regular search results are.\\nGoogle\\nIn addition to the AI Overviews expansion, Google is now testing the integration of ads into its AI Mode. As a refresher, while AI Overviews pop up in addition to good old search results, AI Mode gets rid of search results completely to keep a longer AI output, kind of like what you would get from Google\\'s Gemini chatbot. Within AI Mode, ads may appear below or be integrated into the AI-generated responses where deemed relevant. As an example, Google laid out a scenario where someone might search AI Mode for \"how to build a website for a small business with limited resources.\" The system would generate a step-by-step guide, and if appropriate, an ad for a website builder could be displayed as a potential next step.\\nRelated\\nGoogle\\'s AI Mode Is Now Rolling Out Widely\\nGoogle\\'s AI Mode will give you more than just links.\\nMonetizing AI can be tricky, and it\\'s currently done for the most part with paid memberships for AI chatbots that give you, among other things, improved rate limits and better, more intelligent models. Ads are a way to monetize models without having to put the burden of paying for the service on the user. For AI Overviews, it has worked relatively fine since Search already had ads to some degree, but for AI Mode, some people could find it to be a tad more annoying.\\nThis is currently a test, which means that if you\\'re in the US, you might start seeing them more frequently. Your mileage may vary if you live in other countries, and you won\\'t see them within AI Mode at the moment.\\nSource: Google\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

The news comes after an announcement last week that some customers’ personal data had been accessed in the recent attack on the company.The retailer admitted that “personal customer data” had been stolen by the gang behind the attack. However, the company said this did not include “useable payment or card details” or passwords.But M&S said that for “extra peace of mind” customers will be prompted to change their passwords next time they log in to their online accounts.The company, which employs about 64,000 people and operates more than 1,400 stores globally, is continuing to investigate the breach.Here’s what we know so far about the M&S cyber attack.What happened in the M&S cyber attack?Marks & Spencer first revealed the cyber attack on Monday, April 21, after customers reported payment issues and delays receiving online orders.In an email to shoppers, M&S chief executive Stuart Machin wrote: “Over the last few days, M&S has been managing a cyber incident. To protect you and the business, it was necessary to temporarily make some small changes to our store operations, and I am sincerely sorry if you experienced any inconvenience.“Importantly, our stores remain open, and our website and app are operating as normal. There is no need for you to take any action at this time, and if the situation changes, we will let you know.”Availability of some food and drink products was affected by the cyber attack (Jonathan Brady/PA)PA Wire\"This is a pretty bad episode of ransomware,\" he said.\"It is a highly disruptive event and a very difficult one for them to deal with.\"\"I would suggest there is a high level of confidence this is a ransomware-style event,\" Dan Card, cyber expert at BCS, the chartered institute for IT, told the BBC.\"I describe these as like a digital bomb has gone off. So recovering from them is often both technically and logistically challenging… the victim organisation is likely going to be working around the clock to respond and recover.\"Ransomware is a type of malicious software that locks or encrypts a victim\\'s data and demands payment, usually in cryptocurrency, to restore access.Who was behind the M&S cyber attack? It said the group was suspected of breaching M&S systems as early as February 2025, allegedly stealing the Windows domain\\'s NTDS.dit file—a sensitive database containing user credentials. They are also believed to have used ransomware to encrypt parts of M&S\\'s infrastructure.Also called UNC3944, Octo Tempest or Muddled Libra, Scattered Spider is reportedly known for employing advanced social engineering tactics, including phishing and multi-factor authentication (MFA) fatigue attacks, to infiltrate large organisations.Phishing tricks users into revealing sensitive information, while MFA fatigue involves bombarding users with repeated login requests in hopes they’ll approve one out of frustration or confusion.The incident comes in the wake of a number of UK retailers, including Marks and Spencer and Co-op, being hit by hackers (PA)PA Archive\"Scattered Spider is one of the most dangerous and active hacking groups we are monitoring,\" Graeme Stewart, the head of public sector at security company Check Point, told Sky News.\"Since they first appeared in 2022, they have been linked to more than 100 targeted attacks across industries such as telecoms, finance, retail and gaming.”BleepingComputer reported that DragonForce ransomware was deployed to VMware ESXi hosts on April 24 to encrypt virtual machines. The group reportedly gained access to M&S systems and remained undetected for weeks.Scattered Spider reportedly comprises young hackers, some as young as 16, who frequent hacker forums, Telegram channels, and Discord servers. Some members are also believed to be linked to the \"Com”, a loosely affiliated community known for cyber and real-world criminal activity that has drawn media attention.Following the breach, M&S enlisted CrowdStrike, Microsoft, and Fenix24 cybersecurity experts to help investigate and contain the incident. The company declined to provide BleepingComputer with additional details about the attack.What impact has the cyber attack had on M&S?\"Since the incident, food sales have been impacted by reduced availability, although this is already improving,” M&S said.\"We have also incurred additional waste and logistics costs, due to the need to operate manual processes, impacting profit in the first quarter.\"In Fashion, Home & Beauty, online sales and trading profit have been heavily impacted by the necessary decision to pause online shopping, however stores have remained resilient.”M&S estimates that it will lose approximately £300 million as a result of the cyber attack.\"As a team, we have worked around the clock with suppliers and partners to contain the incident and stabilise operations, taking proactive measures to minimise the disruption for customers,” the retailer said.\"We are focused on recovery, restoring our systems, operations and customer proposition over the rest of the first half, with the aim of exiting this period a much stronger business.”Nayna McIntosh, a former M&S executive and founder of Hope Fashion, said the decision to halt online orders was comparable to “cutting off a limb.”Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the pause on online orders will be “hugely damaging for sales”.“Fashion sales are likely to take a big hit particularly as the attack has come during the spell of warm weather when summer ranges would ordinarily be piling up in virtual baskets,” she added. “While other retailers have not been immune to IT breaches, the depth of Marks and Spencer’s problems in resolving the issue are worrying, and it may take some time to win back some warier shoppers.”Shares fell 2.2 per cent to 377.3p at the end of April, with more than £700 million wiped from the company’s market value since the cyber attack.When will I be able to order online from M&S again?It is not yet known exactly when M&S will be able to take online orders again. However, the company revealed that it expects disruption up until late July.\"We expect online disruption to continue throughout June and into July as we restart, then ramp up operations,\" M&S said.\\n```\\n\\n## [Marks & Spencer says cyber attack disruption set to cost £300m and last to July](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/tech/marks-spencer-b1228908.html) (#32459)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 10:50:22+00:00\\n\\n```\\nMarks & Spencer has said disruption from a major cyber attack is expected to continue through to July and cost the company around £300 million.The high street giant halted orders on its website and saw empty shelves after being targeted by hackers around the Easter weekend.Customer personal data, which could have included names, email addresses, postal addresses and dates of birth, was also taken by hackers in the attack.Chief executive Stuart Machin described the incident as a “bump in the road” and said he hopes the company will come out “in a better shape”.Availability of some food and drink products was affected by the cyber attack (Jonathan Brady/PA)PA WireThe retailer revealed on Wednesday morning that online sales and profits in its fashion, home and beauty business have been “heavily impacted”.Disruption to online operations is set “to continue throughout June and into July as we restart, then ramp up operations”, it said.However, it indicated that shoppers will see improvements over the coming weeks.It added that clothing and home sales have been “resilient” in stores in recent weeks.Meanwhile, food sales were affected by reduced availability but the business stressed this is “already improving”.The group has also reported “additional waste and logistics costs” after switching to manual processes following the attack.M&S updated the stock market on its financial performance (Yui Mok/PA)PA WireM&S said the incident is expected drag its group operating profits down by around £300 million this year, but expects this to be reduced through cost management, insurance and other reactions.It has been reported that the business could secure as much as £100 million from an insurance payout.Mr Machin said: “It has been challenging, but it is a moment in time, and we are now focused on recovery, with the aim of exiting this period a much stronger business.“There is no change to our strategy and our longer-term plans to reshape M&S for growth and, if anything, the incident allows us to accelerate the pace of change as we draw a line and move on.“This incident is a bump in the road, and we will come out of this in better shape, and continue our plan to reshape M&S for customers, colleagues and shareholders.”It came as the company reported a higher-than-expected adjusted pre-tax profit of £875.5 million for the year to March, up 22.2% on the previous year.The group was buoyed stronger profits in its food arm, which saw sales increase by 8.7% to £9 billion over the year.M&S revenues grew by 6% to £13.8 billion as a whole for the year, as fashion, home and beauty sales grew by 3.5%.\\n```\\n\\n## [Who are Scattered Spider?

It’s estimated that M&S made a loss of over £300m in profits as a result of the ransomware attack. While investigations into the attack are ongoing, speculation regarding the culprits has pointed to a group called Scattered Spider, which is thought to have leveraged the tools of DragonForce. Here is what we know about this shady organisation. The retailer is continuing to deal with the fallout of a cyber-attackPA WireWho are Scattered Spider? Also called UNC3944, Octo Tempest or Muddled Libra, Scattered Spider is a hacking group comprised of hackers – some thought to be as young as 16.Members are said to frequent hacker forums, Telegram channels and Discord servers and are believed to be linked to the \"Com”, a loosely affiliated community known for cyber and real-world criminal activity.Graeme Stewart, the head of public sector at security company Check Point, told Sky News: \"Scattered Spider is one of the most dangerous and active hacking groups we are monitoring.\"Since they first appeared in 2022, they have been linked to more than 100 targeted attacks across industries such as telecoms, finance, retail and gaming.”Members have been suspected of a hack on Caesars casinos – which cost the group $15m (£11.2m) to restore its network. Other UK businesses that police suspect may have been targeted include Co-op and Harrods. The group is said to be scattered, as the name suggests, with members around the world. Despite this, they are a highly organised criminal network, Mr Stewart added. \"Even with several arrests made in the US and Europe, their structure allows them to regroup quickly,” he said. Scattered Spiders is thought to use SIM swapping to trick phone providers into thinking a hacker is the real owner of a phone. This can help them to get around two-factor authentication to impersonate IT staff.What might happen next?According to a journalist at the BBC, who claimed to have received communication from the hackers, the group said they had stolen large amounts of consumer and employee data and were “frustrated” that the Co-op didn’t give in to their demands.As for what lies in store for the future of M&S, it appears that teams are working to resume regular online activity and that the hack may have helped stretngthen their systems. Although M&S is still working to resolve its IT issues, Mr Manchin claims that the attack has helped the retailer understand \"new and innovative ways of working\".\"If anything, the incident allows us to accelerate the pace of change as we draw a line and move on,\" he said. Hackers are trying new techniques to get access to secretsJake Moore, global cybersecurity adviser at Eset, said other retailers being targeted in the wake of the M&S breach was typical, as hacking groups are often inspired to use the same type of ransomware elsewhere after a successful hack.\"It\\'s typical for similar companies in the same sector to become secondary targets after a huge cyber-attack,\" he said.\"As the strain of ransomware called DragonForce can simply be purchased on the dark web in a model called \\'ransomware-as-a-service\\', other hacking groups are also able to attempt their luck on similar businesses and start demanding ransoms where possible.\"It is often a precautionary measure to shut down parts of a system after a major cyber-attack to mitigate any threats and prevent similar breaches.\"However, attacks involving the DragonForce ransomware most commonly start by targeting known vulnerabilities such as attacking systems that have not been kept up to date with the latest security patches, so businesses need to be extra vigilant and improve how quickly they update their networks.\"Cybersecurity expert Cody Barrow, chief executive of EclecticIQ, said the flurry of attacks showed cybercriminals are becoming bolder.\"Coming on the heels of recent breaches at Co-op and M&S, it highlights an alarming trend: attackers are becoming increasingly opportunistic, exploiting weaknesses across complex, highly interconnected supply chains,\" he said, warning that artificial intelligence was also making it easier for lower-skilled hackers to put together sophisticated attacks.\"What\\'s deeply concerning is generative AI is accelerating the threat landscape.\"Sophisticated phishing campaigns, deepfake social engineering, and adaptive malware are now within reach of even low-skilled attackers.\"This widespread access to advanced attack tools is driving up attack volume, speed and complexity.\"\\n```\\n\\n## [Marks and Spencer website goes DOWN: Customers left unable to browse online as retailer continues to...](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14738037/Marks-Spencer-website-Customers-left-unable-browse-online-retailer-continues-deal-aftermath-devastating-cyber-attack.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490) (#37894)\\n\\n> 2025-05-22 06:44:12+00:00\\n\\n```\\nMarks and Spencer website goes DOWN: Customers left unable to browse online as retailer continues to deal with aftermath of devastating cyber-attack\\n06:58, 22 May 2025, updated\\n07:44, 22 May 2025\\nBy\\nMATTHEW LODGE\\nMarks and Spencer\\'s website has gone down overnight, leaving customers unable to browse online.The retailer, which has been forced to suspend online orders for weeks in the aftermath of a devastating cyber-attack, saw its regular homepage replaced with a holding screen late on Wednesday night.People visiting the website this morning have been greeted with the message: \\'Sorry you can\\'t browse the site currently.

Rising energy bills, broadband costs and the sharpest increase in water bills since privatisation – despite public anger over the quality of service offered – all added to the cost of living squeeze.Economists had forecast a jump in inflation based on the flurry of annual bill increases. But at 3.5% – the highest rate in the G7 – the rise was bigger than the 3.3% rate predicted in the City, and will raise concerns at the Bank of England.Most of the increase was down to energy costs, after a well-telegraphed 6.4% increase in the Ofgem consumer price cap. However, there was a much bigger leap in water and sewerage bills, where prices rose by a whopping 26.1%, the biggest annual increase since February 1988.Although inflation had been cooling for several months, it was clear a jump in the headline rate would come as a consequence of the changes in utility bills, as well as a number of other price increases timed to land in April each year.Inflation has been close to the 2% target since the middle of last year, having fallen back from a peak of more than 11% in late 2022 after the Russian invasion of Ukraine sent energy prices soaring. Now it is on the rise again, and Threadneedle Street forecasts it will peak at an average of 3.5% over the summer months and does not expect it to return to its 2% target until early 2027.Inflation graphicUsually, inflation sticking above the Bank’s target for so long would entirely rule out interest rate cuts. However, at 4.25%, official borrowing costs are squeezing businesses and households at a time when there are concerns about economic growth given heightened uncertainty as Donald Trump’s trade wars rattle the global economy.In this world, policymakers are attempting to strike a balance between bearing down on inflation, while supporting activity in the economy. Given the higher-than-expected inflationary burst in April, there are concerns that the Bank will not be able to reduce borrowing costs by as much as hoped, even as economic uncertainty remains elevated.There are, however, some signs that the rise in inflation should prove temporary. Business leaders have been warning about the impact of the government’s £25bn increase in employer national insurance contributions (NICs) – introduced last month – being passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.Economists say there was some evidence in the April data, after services inflation – which is more sensitive to labour costs – sharply strengthened on the month, from 4.7% to 5.4%. To many business groups this was a clear sign of costs being passed on.However, the picture is not entirely clear. Much of the overshoot was caused by the timing of Easter. The Office for National Statistics highlighted that it gathered its data for consumer prices during this year’s Easter holidays, when travel and tourism companies sharply increase prices. Because it gathered last year’s data outside the long bank holiday weekend, the inflation rate – which measures the change in price from a year earlier – is unflatteringly high.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionAir fares increased by 27.5% compared with those in March, the second biggest month-on-month increase on record, while prices for recreation and culture, particularly foreign holidays, also rose sharply.IIn contrast, the rate of inflation for restaurants and hotels, a sector particularly exposed to higher labour costs, cooled on the month. Still, other economists point to food inflation, which is also likely to be influenced by the NICs increase, where price growth increased from 2.9% to 3.2%.Where the tax increase is having a more noticeable impact, however, is in terms of hiring, after figures published earlier this month showed unemployment hitting the highest level in almost four years. That ought to concern Threadneedle Street’s policymakers for the months ahead.\\n```\\n\\n## [Inflation jumps to 3.5% deepening cost of living crisis for millions of Londoners](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/inflation-april-cpi-bills-cost-of-living-rachel-reeves-b1228904.html) (#32479)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 09:11:38+00:00\\n\\n```\\nUK inflation jumped to 3.5% in April after bill hikes sent the cost of living soaring.The rise in Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation, from 2.6% in March, is higher than economists were forecasting and takes the CPI to its highest level since January 2024. It comes after Ofgem\\'s energy price cap rose by 6.4% in April, having fallen a year earlier, alongside a raft of bill hikes for under-pressure households, including steep increases to water charges, as well as rises for council tax, mobile and broadband tariffs, and TV licences among many others.Environment Secretary Steve Reed, MP for Streatham and Croydon North, admitted the surprise rise in inflation would be a blow to households in London and other parts of Britain struggling to make ends meet. “It is disappointing,” he told Times Radio.“I know from people in my own constituency as well as elsewhere how difficult the cost-of-living crisis is for people.“But no-one said we could fix the entire economy overnight.”Economists had been expecting a rise in inflation to 3.3% last month.The Office for National Statistics outlined what was behind the surprise jump in inflation.Its acting director-general Grant Fitzner said: “Significant increases in household bills caused inflation to climb steeply.Chancellor Rachel Reeves admitting inflation at 3.5% was ‘disappointing’PA WireChancellor Rachel Reeves said she is “disappointed” with the inflation rise as cost of living pressures “weigh down on working people”.She said: “We are a long way from the double-digit inflation we saw under the previous administration, but I\\'m determined that we go further and faster to put more money in people\\'s pockets.“That\\'s why we have increased the minimum wage for millions of working people, frozen fuel duty to protect commuters and struck three trade deals in the past two weeks that will go towards cutting bills.”But Shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride blamed Labour\\'s \"damaging\" tax increase for the rise in inflation.He said: \"We left Labour with inflation bang on target, but Labour\\'s economic mismanagement is pushing up the cost of living for families - on top of the £3,500 hit to households from the Chancellor\\'s damaging jobs tax.\"Families are paying the price for the Labour Chancellor\\'s choices.\"The Liberal Democrats warned inflation could spiral out of control unless the Chancellor reversed her decision to increase employers\\' national insurance contributions.Treasury spokeswoman Daisy Cooper said: “Today\\'s grim figures reveal a triple whammy on Britain\\'s households - resulting from the Government\\'s disastrous jobs tax, Donald Trump\\'s devastating tariffs and April\\'s damaging business rates bill rises.”\\n```\\n\\n## [UK inflation rate rises to highest in more than a year](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2xx4n1xx0o) (#33072)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 11:39:19+00:00\\n\\n```\\n1 day agoCharlotte EdwardsBusiness reporter, BBC NewsGetty ImagesUK inflation rate: How quickly are prices rising?Dharshini David: Inflation surprise suggests the outlook could be gloomier than we thoughtPrices were expected to rise at 3.3% in the year to April.The Bank of England has previously said it expects inflation to peak at 3.7% between July and September 2025 before slowly falling.One of the Bank\\'s key tasks is to keep inflation at 2% and it cuts or raises interest rates to achieve that.The idea is that if you make borrowing more expensive, people have less money to spend. People may also be encouraged to save more.In turn, this reduces demand for goods and slows price rises.Huw Pill, chief economist at the Bank of England who sits on the nine-person committee which votes on interest rates, said earlier this week that he feared the Bank was reducing rates too rapidly and that the momentum behind falling inflation was \"stuttering\".Water and sewerage prices rose by 26.1% in April, which the ONS said was the largest rise for 37 years, since official records began. A sharp jump in the cost of airfares compared to April last year also helped drive up inflation.The later Easter this year is thought to have contributed to the rise in flight costs and package holidays, which is expected to be a one-off increase.Meanwhile, the cost of services specifically rose 5.4% in the year to April, which some economists attributed to the rise in National Insurance Contributions for employers and a higher minimum wage coming into force, changes which pushed up costs for businesses more broadly.Services inflation refers to rises in prices for things that are bought for use or consumption, like eating at a restaurant, getting a haircut, or going to the cinema.Britain is a services-led economy which means that more of our jobs come from providing a service rather than making a product.Core inflation which strips out volatile prices such as energy and food also rose more than expected.Chancellor Rachel Reeves said she was \"disappointed\" with the figures but said April\\'s minimum wage rise and the decision to freeze fuel duty would help people with cost of living pressures.Mel Stride, shadow chancellor, said the figure was \"worrying for families\".\"We left Labour with inflation bang on target, but Labour\\'s economic mismanagement is pushing up the cost of living for families,\" he said.\\'Supermarket shop is getting more and more expensive\\'Tracy McGuigan-Haigh, 47, lives with her 11-year-old daughter Ruby in Dewsbury and works in retail.She has to fit her working hours around looking after Ruby and receives universal credit on top of her wage.

Higher energy bills were followed by the biggest rise in water bills for over 35 years. Add in the continued rises in prices of food and services, a spike in airfares, and you get not only the highest inflation in a year - 3.5% in the 12 months to April - but a situation where prices are rising faster than in France or Germany.The good news is that, for more workers, pay rises are still outpacing the rate at which prices are rising. That means their money, on the whole, is stretching further. What\\'s more, inflation remains a lot lower than it was - that peak of 11% in late 2022 - and should stay that way.But the rise today is not about to be immediately reversed either.The rise in gas and electricity bills was propelled by higher wholesale global costs – the same factors that triggered the cost of living crisis a few years ago. Those wholesale costs are falling. But, due to the way our bills are set, it will take a while for that to mean lower prices for customers.As for services inflation, part of the reason it rose in April was a spike in airfares because of the late Easter holidays this year. That distorted the figures and will be reversed. And the rise in vehicle excise duty was also a one-off.But price pressures in other services – such as restaurant meals – remain higher than the Bank of England would like to see. And some economists worry that rises in those kind of areas suggest that bosses are passing on National insurance Contributions and other wage cost increases. That could continue. The government\\'s own policies risk adding to inflation.It\\'s those kind of factors that prompt economists to think that inflation could inch up further over the next few months, although they think it will remain below 4%. And won\\'t fall back until 3% until next year. It is why some don\\'t expect the Bank of England to cut the interest rates more than one more time this year – which may come as a disappointment for the hundreds of thousands of homeowners looking to remortgage over the next year.But there are also some factors that could help bring inflation down. US President Donald Trump\\'s trade war has led to expectations of weaker global growth and so brought down the price of oil and many other commodities on world markets. That should bring petrol down further – and help curb increases in food bills, as could the deal struck wit the EU this week. And the continued uncertainty over the President\\'s ultimate trade policy could yet see more cheap imports from the likes of China imported here.As ever, inflation is an uncertain beast.As the Chancellor acknowledges, it is painful for households – particularly those whose incomes aren\\'t keeping up.\\n```\\n\\n## [UK inflation rate: How quickly are prices rising?](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17rgd8e9gjo) (#34837)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 13:24:28+00:00\\n\\n```\\n1 day agoBBCPrices in the UK rose by 3.5% in the 12 months to April, with the inflation rate fuelled by higher household energy and water bills.Inflation remains above the Bank of England\\'s target which is 2%. It moves interest rates up and down to try to keep inflation at that level.The Bank expects inflation to rise again this year after several months of gradual falls. It has cut interest rates four times since last August to the current 4.25%. What is inflation? Inflation is the increase in the price of something over time. For example, if a bottle of milk costs £1 but is £1.05 a year later, then annual milk inflation is 5%.How is the UK\\'s inflation rate measured?The prices of hundreds of everyday items, including food and fuel, are tracked by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).This virtual \"basket of goods\" is regularly updated to reflect shopping trends, with virtual reality headsets and yoga mats added in 2025, and local newspaper adverts removed.It was a bigger rise than analysts had expected, which the ONS said was driven by \"significant increases in household bills\", such as gas and electricity.The Bank also considers other measures such as \"core inflation\" when deciding whether and how to change rates.Core CPI doesn\\'t include food or energy prices because they tend to be very volatile, so can be a better indication of longer term trends.Core CPI was 3.8% in April, up from 3.4% in March.Why are prices still rising?Inflation has fallen significantly since hitting 11.1% in October 2022, which was the highest rate for 40 years.However, that doesn\\'t mean prices are falling - just that they are rising less quickly.Inflation soared in 2022 because oil and gas were in greater demand after the Covid pandemic, and energy prices surged again when Russia invaded Ukraine.It then remained well above the 2% target partly because of higher food prices.Why does putting up interest rates help to lower inflation?When inflation was well above its 2% target, the Bank of England increased interest rates to 5.25%, a 16-year high.The idea is that if you make borrowing more expensive, people have less money to spend. People may also be encouraged to save more.In turn, this reduces demand for goods and slows price rises.But it is a balancing act - increasing borrowing costs risks harming the economy.For example, homeowners face higher mortgage repayments, which can outweigh better savings deals.Businesses also borrow less, making them less likely to create jobs. Some may cut staff and reduce investment.What is happening to UK interest rates and will they go down again?The Bank of England cut rates in August and November 2024, and again in February and May 2025, taking rates to 4.25%. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said the May decision was a result of inflation dropping back, and indicated that further \"gradual and careful\" cuts could follow. However he warned that the introduction of US tariffs has shown \"how unpredictable the global economy can be\". The Bank said it expected the tariffs to slow the UK economy and lead to lower inflation than expected.The Bank previously said it expected inflation to spike at 3.7% between July and September 2025 before dropping back towards the end of 2027. When will interest rates go down again?How Trump\\'s tariffs might affect you and your moneyAre wages keeping up with inflation?What is happening to inflation and interest rates in Europe and the US?The US and EU countries have also been trying to limit price increases.The inflation rate for countries using the euro was 2.2% in April 2025, the same as in March and down slightly from 2.3% in February.In June 2024, the European Central Bank (ECB) cut its main interest rate from an all-time high of 4% to 3.75%, the first fall in five years. It has since cut rates a further five times, taking its key rate to 2.5%.Inflation in the US fell to 2.4% in March, which was down from 2.8% the previous month but still above the US central bank\\'s 2% target.After a string of cuts in the latter part of 2024, the US central bank again chose to hold rates at its May meeting, citing the uncertainty generated by the US tariffs. That leaves its key interest rate unchanged in a range of 4.25% to 4.5%.The Federal Reserve has repeatedly come under attack from President Trump, who wants to see further cuts.\\n```\\n\\n## [Starmer\\'s UK: Inflation Hits 15-Month High as Utility Bills Soar](https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2025/05/21/starmers-uk-runaway-inflation-hits-15-month-high-as-utility-bills-soar/) (#35737)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 10:39:36+00:00\\n\\n```\\nBritain’s annual inflation rate charged upwards in April led by household energy and water bills, official data showed on Wednesday.\\nThe Consumer Prices Index soared to 3.5 percent last month, up from 2.6 percent in March, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said in a statement.

The measures will crack down on Moscow’s so-called “shadow fleet” — around 200 vessels used to transport Russian oil exports globally — the 27-nation bloc and London said in separate statements. They are the 17th set of European sanctions imposed on Russia since it invaded its neighbor in 2022, the E.U. said. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a post on X that it was “time to intensify the pressure on Russia to bring about the ceasefire.”The coordinated efforts came in direct response to Russian drone attacks on Ukraine over the weekend, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said in a separate statement issued by his government Tuesday. “Delaying peace efforts will only redouble our resolve to help Ukraine to defend itself and use our sanctions to restrict Putin’s war machine,” he added. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at the E.U. headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday.Omar Havana / APThanking his European allies, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in an overnight address that it was “important that America continues to be involved in the peace process.”“Russia fears American involvement,” he said, adding that many lives could be saved if the U.S. “pressures Putin to end the war.”Russian Foreign Ministry\\xa0spokeswoman Maria Zakharova\\xa0said the Kremlin would never bow to “ultimatums.”The sanctions were announced without accompanying measures from the U.S., despite intense lobbying from European leaders for the White House to do so if Putin rejected a ceasefire. Trump chose not to impose his own sanctions on Russia after a two-hour-long phone call with Putin on Monday, in which he dropped his earlier insistence on a 30-day truce and suggested that he could walk away entirely from the negotiations to end the war that he once promised to end on \"day one\" of his second presidential term. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told a congressional hearing Tuesday that the White House would continue to push an existing bill that could slap a 500% tariff on buyers of Russian oil and gas exports if there was no progress on a peace deal. But, he added that Trump “believes that right now, you start threatening sanctions, the Russians will stop talking, and there’s value in us being able to talk and drive them to get to the table.” Earlier this week, Trump drew American-born Pope Leo into the conflict, suggesting that the Vatican could play a bigger role in hosting the negotiations.As uncertainty hangs over Washington’s future role, Reuters reported Wednesday that Ukraine will present a white paper to the E.U. calling for more aggressive measures against Moscow, including\\xa0seizing Russian assets and bringing in sanctions for some buyers of Russian oil. Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials said dozens of people were injured early Wednesday by Russian drone attacks on the cities of Kharkiv, Sumy and Kyiv. Moscow also released footage of Putin visiting the western Russian\\xa0region of Kursk on Tuesday for the first time since his forces regained control from Ukrainian forces.Astha RajvanshiAstha Rajvanshi is a reporter for NBC News Digital, based in London.

Trump did not follow through on previous threats to introduce “large-scale” sanctions on Russia if there was no ceasefire, but instead extolled the prospect of restarting trade with Moscow.“Russia wants to do largescale TRADE with the United States when this catastrophic ‘bloodbath’ is over, and I agree,” Trump wrote on social media. Ukraine, he added, “can be a great beneficiary on Trade in the process of rebuilding its Country”.For Europe, the question is: what next? This week the EU approved its 17th round of sanctions against Russia, which had already been in the pipeline weeks before the latest ultimatums to Putin came and went. These were a more incremental set of measures than earlier rounds, as the EU finds it harder to agree new targets, with each sanction requiring unanimity and many big measures that command consensus having already been agreed.On Tuesday the EU added dozens of Russian business people and companies to its sanctions list, bringing the total number of individuals and entities under asset freezes and travel bans to more than 2,400. It also said it had imposed the largest-ever package targeting Putin’s shadow fleet, poorly maintained tankers using flags of convenience that enable Russia to sell oil to countries such as India, in defiance of western restrictions.After the G7 and EU banned companies on their territories from selling or supporting sales of Russian oil above $60 a barrel, European shipping companies sold dozens of ageing vessels that could be re-registered abroad in places such as India, Hong Kong, Vietnam or Seychelles that are not participating in the economic sanctions against Moscow. These vessels enable Russia to sell its oil above the price cap.A further 189 vessels were banned from accessing EU ports and services such as insurance in an effort to stop the trade, bringing the total number of ships under sanctions to 342.But for several EU countries the measures are insufficient, especially as the shadow fleet continues to grow. One EU diplomat estimated that Russia had about 800 vessels in its shadow fleet, compared with only 100 two years ago.Even before these measures were finalised, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the EU was preparing “hard-hitting sanctions” targeting Russian energy and banks, including measures against the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines. Nord Stream 1 was rendered unusable after a series of underwater blasts for which no one has ever claimed responsibility; Nord Stream II never received a licence. But Russia has expressed interest in reviving the gas projects connecting Russia and Germany. “The idea [of sanctions] is to dissuade any interest, notably interest from investors, from pursuing any activity in Nord Stream in the future,” von der Leyen’s spokesperson said.As well as financial sanctions and clamping down on more shadow fleet vessels, the commission is also looking at lowering the $60 oil price cap.The plans fall short of what Ukraine and its strongest allies in the EU would like. EU countries, such as those in the Nordic and Baltic regions, would like the bloc to move urgently to cease buying Russian gas – earlier this month the commission proposed phasing out all Russian gas by the end of 2027. For now, the EU remains Russia’s largest buyer of liquified natural gas, with much of the energy eventually going to Germany, via Belgian ports.Ukraine is arguing for sanctions on foreign countries that buy Russian oil, according to leaked documents from Kyiv seen by Reuters, which was reported on Wednesday. Such secondary sanctions, which could hit large importers such as China and India, would be a significant step. The EU has so far limited itself to imposing sanctions on a few relatively small companies in China and other states that have been supplying Russia with military technology. Ukraine would also like the oil price cap reduced to $30 a barrel.Questions are growing about what the EU can do without the US – the price cap was agreed by the G7, which includes Washington. Kaja Kallas, the EU’s foreign policy chief, has described the oil price cap as “the most important” measure in the 18th package, because of the role fossil fuels play in keeping the Russian economy afloat. She cited reports on the state of the Russian economy, which, she said, “is not doing well”.If the US moves to ease sanctions on Russia, EU insiders fear European unity could fracture. Hungary, which has routinely threatened to block sanctions, could veto the bloc’s sanctions on the Russian economy when they are up for renewal in July, an explosive move that could end the restrictions on €210bn Russian central bank assets frozen in the EU.Some EU countries, notably including a couple of Baltic states, could reimpose sanctions at national level, but many countries do not have the legal framework. Officials are looking at other ways to “Hungary-proof” sanctions, such as imposing capital controls and steep tariffs on Russian economic sectors, rather than sanctions. EU trade policy operates on qualified majority votes, while sanctions require unanimity.

In response, Moscow began relying on a so-called shadow fleet – tankers with murky ownership and often without proper insurance – to continue exportsZelenskyy on Tuesday welcomed the EU sanctions. “It is important to severely restrict the Russian tanker fleet, which serves to finance killings, as well as all schemes that Russia uses to build up its military industry,” he wrote on his social media channels.G7 finance ministers meet in Canada to discuss Ukraine-RussiaJakub KrupaFinance ministers of the world’s seven largest economies – G7 – are meeting in Banff, Alberta in Canada to discuss their ideas on Ukraine and concerns about disruptions resulting from Donald Trump’s unorthodox trade policy.Before the meeting, German finance minister Lars Klingbeil warned that trade disputes with the US should be resolved as soon as possible, as he stressed they were a burden on the economy and job security.Instead of this infighting, G7 should make it clear that it “will continue to stand firmly by Ukraine’s side” and oppose “the terrible destruction caused by Russian president Vladimir Putin’s war,” Klingbeil said.Ukraine will be represented there, with the country’s finance minister Sergii Marchenko in attendance.These comments come as Europe scramble to keep pressure on Russia with the latest round of sanctions.Here are a couple of images of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, visiting the border region of Kursk on Tuesday, several weeks after Russian forces pushed Ukrainian troops out of the area:Russian president Vladimir Putin visits the Kursk-II nuclear power plant under construction, in the Kursk region, in this still image taken from video released on Wednesday.

Photograph: KREMLIN.RU/ReutersUkraine to ask EU to lead on Russia sanctions as US waversUkraine will ask the EU next week to consider big new steps to isolate Moscow, including seizing Russian assets and bringing in sanctions for some buyers of Russian oil, as US president Donald Trump has backed off from tightening sanctions, reports Reuters in an exclusive.A previously unreported Ukrainian white paper to be presented to the EU calls for the 27-member bloc to take a more aggressive and independent position on sanctions as uncertainty hangs over Washington’s future role.According to Reuters, among 40 pages of recommendations were calls to adopt legislation that would speed up the EU’s seizure of assets from sanctioned individuals, and send them to Ukraine. Those under sanctions could then seek compensation from Russia.The EU should consider a range of steps to make its sanctions apply more forcefully beyond its own territory, including targeting foreign companies that use its technology to help Russia, and “the introduction of secondary sanctions on purchasers of Russian oil”.Such secondary sanctions, which could hit big buyers such as India and China, would be a major step that Europe has so far been reluctant to take. Trump had publicly discussed this before taking the decision not to act for now, reports Reuters.The white paper also calls for the EU to consider using more majority-rules decision making over sanctions, to prevent individual member states from blocking measures that otherwise require unanimity.After speaking to Vladimir Putin on Monday, Trump opted not to impose fresh sanctions on Russia, dashing hopes of European leaders and Kyiv who had been lobbying him for weeks to ratchet up pressure on Moscow.Trump spoke to Ukrainian and European leaders after his call with Putin and told them he did not want to impose sanctions now and to give time for talks to take place, a person familiar with conversation told Reuters.The EU and the UK imposed additional sanctions against Russia on Tuesday anyway, saying they still hope Washington will join them. But Europeans are openly discussing ways they can maintain pressure on Moscow if Washington is no longer prepared to participate.Iran’s parliament approved a 20-year strategic partnership on Wednesday between Moscow and Tehran, state media reported. The agreement represents a deepening of bilateral ties including closer defence cooperation.Russian president Vladimir Putin and his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian signed the strategic partnership document on 17 January.The Russian legislative branch approved the pact in April. While the agreement does not include a mutual defence clause, it says both countries will work together against common military threats, develop their military-technical cooperation, and take part in joint exercises, reports Reuters.Since the start of the war in Ukraine in 2022, Iran and Russia have deepened military ties, with western countries accusing Iran of providing missiles and drones for Russian attacks on Ukraine. Tehran denies providing weapons for Russian use in Ukraine.The strategic pact also includes several clauses aimed at boosting economic partnership, notably by strengthening direct interbank cooperation and promoting their national financial products.A free trade deal between Iran and the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union went into effect last week, cutting down tariffs to boost trade between the two economies, which are both under heavy western sanctions.Russian strike on Ukrainian military training site kills six, says KyivA Russian strike on a military training site in north-eastern Ukraine has killed six soldiers and wounded at least 10 others, the Ukrainian national guard said on Wednesday, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).Ukraine’s Sumy border region – from where Kyiv’s troops launched last year’s major cross-border offensive into Russia’s Kursk region – has come under intensifying attacks in recent months after Moscow recaptured its territory.“Six soldiers were killed and more than 10 wounded as a result of the attack, while they carried out exercises at a military shooting range,” Ukraine’s national guard said in a Facebook post, adding that an investigation has been opened into the incident.Russia’s defence ministry on Tuesday evening said it had launched a ballistic missile attack on the site. “During reconnaissance activities … a training camp” for Ukrainian special forces was “detected,” it said in a social media post.“Based on the received coordinates, an Iskander missile strike was launched,” it added. Russia also published footage showing the hit on what it said was a training camp in a wooded area.AFP report that aerial footage showed one strike, sparking a large fire and sending a plume of thick black smoke billowing into the air.“An internal investigation into the incident is under way. The commander of the military unit has been suspended, and the necessary information has been passed on to law enforcement agencies,” Ukraine’s national guard said.Putin visited Kursk region on Ukraine border, says KremlinRussian president Vladimir Putin visited the border region of Kursk on Tuesday, several weeks after Russian forces pushed Ukrainian troops out of the area, the Kremlin said on Wednesday.“Vladimir Putin made a working visit the previous day to the Kursk region,” where he met the interim governor and others, the Kremlin said in a statement, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP).Ukrainian troops seized control of parts of the Kursk region in August 2024, but were pushed out by Moscow’s forces, with help from North Korean soldiers, by the end of April.Russian president Vladimir Putin visited the border region of Kursk on Tuesday.

The annual meetings of the Group of 7 finance ministers, known as the G7, are typically congenial and in previous years have produced joint commitments to combat inflation and counter the COVID pandemic. There may be less agreement this year as Trump\\'s tariffs threaten to slow growth in many of the gathered nations, including host Canada, which Trump has also suggested become a potential 51st state. “I expect it will be somewhat of a testy conversation among the G7 officials,” said Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University and former top official at the International Monetary Fund. “This is a very difficult period for the relationships among the G7 countries.” The Trump administration has reached an initial trade deal with one G7 member, the United Kingdom, and is engaged in talks with Japan and the European Union. But Canada still faces 25% duties on many of its exports to the United States, including autos, and the other three G7 members — France, Germany, and Italy — all face a baseline tariff of 10% on all their exports as part of the European Union. It will be the first formal meeting of the G7 attended by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who participated in a brief G7 gathering last month on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings in Washington, D.C. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will also attend along with central bank governors from the other G7 nations.“The message from colleagues is pretty clear is that a free and fair and a rules-based multilateral trading system, is a system in which we all win,” Francois-Philippe Champagne, Canada’s minister of finance, said Tuesday.While many finance ministers gathered in Banff this week will likely seek one-on-one meetings with Bessent, it\\'s unlikely any trade deals will be reached, according to a person briefed on preparations for the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity because they did not have authorization to speak about it publicly.Instead, the finance officials will seek to smooth the way toward any agreements before a meeting of the heads of state of the G7 countries in June in nearby Kananaskis, Canada. Bessent may be able to bring a more conciliatory tone to the meetings, Prasad said, as he is often seen as a relatively moderating influence on tariffs in the Trump White House. And there will likely be some areas of agreement, particularly around the Trump administration\\'s goal to address what it calls “global imbalances” in world trade, a reference to the United States\\' large annual trade deficits, which reflects that it imports more than it exports. The White House sees China as the key driver of such imbalances. China has a large trade surplus. “Intentional policy choices by other countries have hollowed out America’s manufacturing sector and undermined our critical supply chains, putting our national and economic security at risk,” Bessent said in a speech last month during the IMF and World Bank meetings. The status of the U.S. dollar may also come up, at least in informal conversations. The dollar dropped in value unexpectedly last month after Trump unveiled his widespread tariffs, while the interest rate on Treasury bonds rose, a sign international investors may have been dumping American assets as confidence in the country\\'s governance and economy eroded. “In the hallways, they’re going to talk about nothing but tariffs and the dollar,” said Steven Kamin, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and former senior economist at the Federal Reserve.At last year\\'s meeting of G7 finance officials in Stresa, Italy, they agreed on a joint statement that said the members have a “strong commitment to a free, fair, and rules-based” trading system. It\\'s not yet clear whether they will be able to agree on such a statement this year. Another question hanging over the meetings will be whether the G7 can come to agreement on a new round of sanctions on Russia. The European Union and U.K. announced sanctions on Russian oil Tuesday, targeting Russia\\'s “shadow fleet” of unregistered oil tankers that are shipping its oil and allowing it to fund its war with Ukraine. Proposals to lower a price cap on Russian oil, set as part of earlier rounds of international sanctions, down from its current level of $60 may also be discussed in meetings Wednesday. Yet the Trump administration, while it has called for greater sanctions on Russian oil, hasn\\'t yet signed on to the new restrictions. Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday, and said the two countries would soon begin ceasefire talks, though no details were available.Ukrainian Finance Minister Sergii Marchenko will also attend the G7 meetings this week, though Ukraine is not a member. Daleep Singh, chief global economist at PGIM Fixed Income and a former deputy national security adviser in the Biden administration, said the issue of Russian oil sanctions will be a key test of what unity remains in the G7. “If you’re looking for something to engender a just and lasting peace, oil sanctions are the place to look,” he said.\\n```\\n\\n## [Putin visits Kursk region for first time since Ukrainian troops expelled](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/putin-visited-kursk-region-time-russia-expelled-ukrainian-122019084) (#34909)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 07:56:48+00:00\\n\\n```\\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has visited the Kursk region for the first time since Russia said it expelled Ukrainian forces from the area in AprilByThe Associated PressMay 21, 2025, 3:13 AMRussian President Vladimir Putin has visited the Kursk region for the first time since Russia said it expelled Ukrainian forces from the area in April.The Kremlin said Wednesday that Putin visited Kursk on the border with Ukraine the day before.Ukrainian forces made a surprise incursion into Kursk in August 2024 in the largest cross-border raid by Kyiv’s forces in the nearly 2 ½-year war, before being pushed out by Russian troops nine months later. Ukraine has not confirmed its expulsion from the area.Putin visited Kursk Nuclear Power Plant-2, which is still under construction, and spoke at a closed meeting with selected volunteers. He also told acting Gov. Alexander Khinshtein that the Kremlin supported the idea of continuing monthly payments to displaced families that still could not return to their homes.Disgruntled residents had previously shown their disapproval over a lack of compensation in rare organized protests.Russia’s Ministry of Defense said its air defenses shot down 159 Ukrainian drones across the country overnight, including 53 over the Oryol region and 51 over the Bryansk region.Popular Reads\\n```\\n\\n## [Ukraine war briefing: Drones blast Russian plant for missile and fighter jet chips](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/22/ukraine-war-briefing-drones-blast-russian-plant-for-missile-and-fighter-jet-chips) (#36617)\\n\\n> 2025-05-22 00:32:22+00:00\\n\\n```\\nUkraine’s military said 10 of its drones hit the Bolkhovsky semiconductor plant, a supplier in the Oryol region to Russian fighter jet and missile makers.

Russia’s defence ministry confirmed a ballistic missile attack on the “training camp” for Ukrainian special forces. Ukraine’s national guard said: “An internal investigation into the incident is under way. The commander of the military unit has been suspended, and the necessary information has been passed on to law enforcement agencies.” Commanders on both sides have been censured during the war after presiding over military assemblies for training, parades and presentations that have come under enemy attack, resulting in casualties.\\nRussia said more than 370 Ukrainian drones attacked across the border on Wednesday, including 27 aimed at Moscow, the capital, where airports had to be temporarily shut down.\\nThe Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said in his nightly video address that the heaviest frontline battles were around Pokrovsk, while Ukrainian forces remained active in two Russian regions along the border: Kursk and Belgorod. Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, visited the Kursk region on Tuesday. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces were advancing at key points along the front, and pro-Russian war bloggers said Russia had penetrated Ukrainian lines between Pokrovsk and Kostiantynivka in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine. The battlefield accounts could not be independently verified.\\nZelenskyy spoke on Wednesday with the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, about the need to put pressure on Russia: “It is important that all decisions are coordinated. Then the sanctions will work. Without pressure on Moscow, a just peace cannot be achieved. Everyone understands this.”\\nRussian military intelligence (the GRU) is targeting organisations delivering assistance to Ukraine by hacking into cameras at crossings and railway stations and near military installations, as well as such tactics as phishing emails and stealing passwords, according to the UK’s intelligence services and those of allies. Daniel Boffey writes that the unit involved – GRU Unit 26165, also known as APT 28 or Fancy Bear – has conducted the malicious cyber-campaign against public and private organisations in Nato states since 2022. In an advisory note, the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) – part of GCHQ – called on private companies involved in the delivery of aid to “take immediate action to protect themselves”.\\nThe Polish navy has chased a “shadow fleet” oil tanker away from an undersea power cable connecting Poland to Sweden. Donald Tusk, the Polish prime minister, said on Wednesday that the ship was undertaking “suspicious” activity and “following a successful intervention by our military, the vessel left for one of the Russian ports”. The Polish defence minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said an emergency meeting of Poland’s Maritime Operations Command would be held on Thursday.\\nFinland has said it expects Russia to further build up troops along their shared border when the war in Ukraine ends, writes Miranda Bryant, after reports that Moscow had strengthened its military bases near the Nato frontier. Maj Gen Sami Nurmi of the Finnish defence forces said the military was following Moscow’s manoeuvring “very closely” in order to “prepare for the worst”. The Finnish border guard announced on Wednesday it had completed the first 35km of a planned 200km fence on its eastern border with Russia, which has been closed for more than a year after Helsinki accused Moscow of directing asylum seekers to Finland in a “hybrid operation”. The fence also uses cameras and sensors to distinguish between people and animals crossing.\\n```\\n\\n## [Trump responds to Zelensky’s call for tougher Russia sanctions](https://www.rt.com/news/617978-trump-zelensky-russia-sanctions/) (#40075)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 20:45:46+00:00\\n\\n```\\nThe US president has said any decision on additional restrictions will be made solely by him\\nUS President Donald Trump has pushed back on calls by Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky for tougher sanctions on Russia, saying the decision is his alone.Zelensky has continued to press for additional restrictions, accusing the Kremlin of failing to follow through on peace overtures. Western nations have imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022 – measures Moscow has repeatedly condemned as illegal and ineffective.Asked by reporters on Wednesday whether he was considering new measures, Trump said it would be “my determination” and “nobody else’s.”He recalled a two-and-a-half-hour phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this week, followed by a conversation with EU leaders. “We’ll see how Russia behaves. We’ll see what’s going to happen,” Trump said, adding, “We have a pretty critical time right now.”\\nBoth Putin and Trump described Monday’s call as productive. Trump said he believed Putin was interested in ending the conflict and warned that additional economic pressure could hinder Washington’s mediation efforts.Putin has said Moscow and Kiev should negotiate a formal memorandum outlining a detailed path to a broader peace agreement, and that a ceasefire could be part of the proposed road map.Trump said he expects progress within two weeks but acknowledged that reaching a deal would be difficult.On Tuesday, the EU and UK introduced new rounds of sanctions targeting Russia. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, a vocal critic of Moscow, said further measures were “in the works.”In a series of posts on X on Tuesday and Wednesday, Zelensky welcomed the move by Kiev’s European supporters, calling it “a step in the right direction.” He also emphasized the need to work closely with the US so that “at some point,” it will impose appropriate sanctions as well.Last week, delegations from Russia and Ukraine met in Istanbul for their first direct talks since Kiev unilaterally withdrew from the peace process in 2022. Russia’s top negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, later said that both sides had agreed to conduct a prisoner exchange involving 1,000 POWs each and to continue contacts once both had prepared detailed ceasefire proposals.Kiev previously demanded an unconditional 30-day ceasefire from Russia before entering direct negotiations – an idea that Moscow said amounts to asking for time for the Ukrainian military to regroup.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday that Moscow and Kiev would each draft their own version of the proposed memorandum, after which “difficult” negotiations would follow to agree on a single text.\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

Scientific advisers to the F.D.A. are set to meet Thursday to decide on the composition of the Covid vaccine to be made available in the fall.During the pandemic, both Dr. Prasad and Dr. Makary sharply criticized vaccine mandates and other public health measures intended to turn back the coronavirus.Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the health secretary, is a longtime vaccine skeptic who spent years campaigning against the Covid shots, claiming falsely at one point that the Covid vaccines have killed more people than the virus.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

The decision means many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall.\\n\"I think we have to admit to ourselves that America is deeply divided on the policy issue of repeat COVID-19 vaccine doses or boosters,\"\\xa0Dr. Vinay Prasad, the FDA\\'s new top vaccines official, said in a video posted by the agency announcing the change.Details of the new rules for COVID-19 vaccine approvals were also outlined in\\xa0an article\\xa0published by The New England Journal of Medicine, authored by Prasad and FDA Commissioner Dr. Martin Makary.Vaccine manufacturers will need to conduct \"randomized, placebo-controlled trials\" before the FDA will approve future applications to give shots to \"all healthy persons\" between the ages of 6 months and 64 years old, they wrote.Otherwise, companies will only be able to get their routine COVID-19 vaccine updates approved for seniors as well as people with an underlying medical condition, like pregnancy or diabetes, that increases the risk of severe disease.\"The range of diseases in the CDC definition of high risk of severe disease is vast, including obesity and even mental health conditions such as depression. Estimates suggest that 100 million to 200 million Americans will have access to vaccines in this manner,\" they wrote.Vaccine makers are being urged to run new randomized studies in adults between the ages of 50 and 64, where they believe the balance of benefits and risks is uncertain. Prasad said they are also encouraging new trials in children under 5.\\n\"I think we have a really good balance between vulnerable people, that people still at high risk will still have a rapid path to access, but people at average risk and low risk, they need evidence,\" said Prasad.Makary and Prasad criticized the U.S. for adopting \"a one-size-fits-all regulatory framework\" to grant broad authorization for past COVID-19 vaccine boosters in the past, and cited poor uptake of past annual COVID-19 booster shots.\\xa0They also pointed to other developed countries that have already limited annual COVID-19 vaccine boosters to only older adults and those with underlying conditions that increase their risk of severe disease.\"The U.S. policy has sometimes been justified by arguing that the American people are not sophisticated enough to understand age- and risk-based recommendations. We reject this view,\" they wrote.\\xa0Dr. Céline Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News,\\xa0told \"CBS Mornings\" Wednesday that these guidelines are essentially taking away the option to get a booster for some.\\n\"Up until now, people have been opting, do they want to (get a booster), do they not? Now, if you\\'re under 65, you may not be able to get an updated booster,\" she said. \"They are requiring clinical trials that, quite frankly, because of how long it takes, how expensive they are, it\\'s very unlikely that they would happen in time for an updated booster for those younger age groups.\"While requiring these clinical trials may seem like a more evidence-based approach, Gounder said she\\'s skeptical.\\xa0\"There\\'s a little double speak going,\" she said, adding typically, there would be a publicly shared systematic review of all vaccine data ahead of a change like this. \"What you got here was a two and a half page paper, which was really a policy opinion piece, in the New England Journal of Medicine in a town hall meeting. Normally, when you have a big change like this at the FDA, this is done much more transparently.\"The new \"regulatory framework for COVID-19 vaccination\" laid out by the FDA\\'s new leadership under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. comes ahead of a key meeting of the agency\\'s outside vaccine advisers this Thursday, to decide on how to update the strain used in next season\\'s shots.\\xa0In recent years, the FDA has greenlit those updates in a process similar to the annual flu shots, based largely on laboratory data showing the vaccines can trigger antibody levels similar to previously approved shots.\\nThat is a lower bar than requiring brand new randomized trials of the vaccines tested against a placebo to show it prevents symptomatic disease — a process which is usually only required for new shots when there is no currently approved immunization available.\\xa0But Makary and Prasad said COVID-19 shots should be held to a different standard, citing differences in how the virus mutates and the immunity offered by vaccines and previous infection.\\xa0\"Ultimately, these studies alone can provide reassurance that the American repeat-boosters-in-perpetuity strategy is evidence-based,\" they wrote.It is unclear whether and when vaccine makers would be able to conduct these kinds of trials, if they wanted to try again for a broader approval from the FDA. Makary and Prasad floated the possibility of trials as soon as the coming months.\"Covid-19 has summer transmission that can facilitate the conduct of randomized studies that continue to apply in future time periods,\" they wrote.\\nPrasad said interim results from some of the studies could be ready \"by next calendar year.\"Pfizer said it is \"evaluating the details shared today\" and is in ongoing talks with the FDA. The company said its shots had been administered to over a billion people, including kids, showing favorable safety data.\"We stand by the science behind the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and continue to believe that broad vaccination programs are an essential tool for helping to prevent COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and severe disease, including death,\" Pfizer spokesperson Steven Danehy said in a statement.Moderna spokesperson Chris Ridley said they \"appreciate the FDA\\'s clear guidance and remain committed to working with the Agency to provide the data they need to ensure access for Americans.\"A Novavax spokesperson declined to comment. Novavax earned a narrow FDA approval over the weekend for its COVID-19 vaccine, which was limited to seniors as well as adults and adolescents with at least one underlying condition.\\nWhile U.S. health care providers are usually allowed to administer vaccines with FDA approval \"off-label\" outside the limits laid out by the agency, a narrower approval can affect access and limit insurance coverage for the vaccinations.\\xa0It comes as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also been weighing narrowed recommendations for the shots.The CDC\\'s recommendations directly impact which vaccinations health insurers are required to cover under the law.\\nIn:\\nCOVID-19 Vaccine\\nCOVID-19\\nFood and Drug Administration\\nFDA\\nAlexander Tin\\nAlexander Tin is a digital reporter for CBS News based in the Washington, D.C. bureau.

Among the changes: when manufacturers want to update the vaccine each year to target the latest variants, they will be required to conduct additional studies to show the effectiveness of the vaccine in people who are not at high risk of severe COVID-19. Since 2023, federal health officials have recommended an annual COVID-19 shot for most people, and vaccine makers have not needed to conduct additional tests on each year’s updated vaccine. It\\'s similar to the way the annual flu shot is updated to target the newest influenza strains, without new studies to re-confirm the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine.Here’s how COVID-19 vaccine guidance is changing in the U.S.For people at high risk of severe COVID-19The process of reviewing and recommending yearly updates to the COVID-19 vaccine would remain essentially the same for anyone at high risk of developing severe COVID-19, which includes older people and anyone with compromised immune systems or a broad range of risk factors. “If you’re older than 65 or you are at high risk of COVID-19, we’re going to use the immunologic endpoints we’ve been using to grant approval,\" said Dr. Vinay Prasad, head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\\'s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (the group that oversees approvals for vaccines and biologic treatments), during a May 20 briefing. \"This is a tremendously broad category; this effectively means 100 million to 200 million Americans, those with the most favorable benefit-to-harm balance, will be covered by these approvals.”That means that additional studies of updated vaccines involving these groups will not be required. Vaccine makers will continue, however, to conduct studies to ensure the shots are safe after they are available. In a medical journal commentary describing the changes, Prasad and FDA commissioner Dr. Martin Makary said that such a study \"does not preclude the conduct of additional randomized studies, particularly studies in pediatric populations.\" Prasad said during the briefing that another scenario that might require additional studies on updated vaccines would be if the virus mutates and changes in a significant way. These would be conducted on an as-needed basis, but not necessarily yearly. Read More: A Baby Receives the First Customized CRISPR TreatmentThe \"high-risk\" category is broad. It includes conditions like asthma, diabetes, and depression—but also physical inactivity, which can be a more subjective health characteristic and applies to most U.S. adults. It\\'s not clear how much documentation, if any, people will have to provide in order to be eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine if they want to get immunized. As they did when a different policy restricted the original COVID-19 vaccines to high-risk groups, doctors and pharmacists will likely make individual and varied decisions about whether people who have these risk factors qualify—and may err on the side of vaccinating people if they want the shot.For people who are not at high risk of severe COVID-19Prasad said the process for approving annual COVID-19 vaccines for people not at high risk will change. The FDA is now telling vaccine makers to conduct additional studies to show that their vaccines provide benefit—in outcomes including lower rates of symptoms, hospitalizations, and deaths from COVID-19—compared to people receiving placebo.The six-month trials would follow people ages 50 to 64 years. (Those results would then be generalized to healthy people as young as six months.) But because some people don’t develop symptoms, and others may only experience mild ones—especially after repeat infections—it could take a very large study to get enough cases to give the results enough statistical power to make them meaningful. That would add to the cost of the vaccines for manufacturers, which could then get passed down to consumers.Read More: We Are Still Not Prepared for the Next Pandemic“We are evaluating the details shared today and discussions with the FDA are ongoing,\" said Pfizer in a statement. \"We stand by the science behind the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and continue to believe that broad vaccination programs are an essential tool for helping to prevent COVID-19 associated hospitalizations and severe disease, including death. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines have been administered to over a billion individuals, including adults, adolescents and children, generating robust data demonstrating a favorable safety profile.”Moderna responded to the new policies by saying “we appreciate the FDA’s clear guidance and remain committed to working with the Agency to provide the data they need to ensure access for Americans.”As of April 2025, only about 23% of U.S. adults got the latest COVID-19 shot—which Prasad cites as evidence that the public is unconvinced that the shot adequately protects against disease. He also said that many Americans have now had multiple COVID-19 infections, which provides immunity for some period of time, and that the effectiveness of the vaccines in providing protection in such a population isn’t clear.Public-health experts acknowledge that specific studies on these populations have not been conducted, but point to generally declining rates of hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 as an indicator that immunity to the virus, provided in part by vaccinations, is likely playing a role.\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

Amid claims that President Joe Biden declined mentally while in office, Golden State gubernatorial candidate Antonio Villaraigosa has suggested that former Vice President Kamala Harris and former Health And Human Services Secretary Xavier Beccerra were involved in a cover-up.Becerra is also running for governor, while the prospect of a potential Harris bid looms large over the field.\\xa0Current California Gov.

He also suggested that at least one doctor had previously claimed Mr Biden was “cognitively fine” — something he claims later turned out to be “not so”.Trump told reporters inside the Oval Office on Monday: “I think it’s very sad, actually. I’m surprised that the public wasn’t notified a long time ago because to get to stage nine, that’s a long time.“Why did it take so long? I mean... this takes a long time, can take years to get to this level of danger.“I think people should try and find out what happened... Maybe it was the same doctor and somebody is not telling the facts.”Meanwhile, his eldest son Donald Trump Jr took aim at Mr Biden’s wife Jill for failing to miss the signs of her husband’s prostate cancer.He posted on X, formerly known as Twitter: “What I want to know is how did Dr. Jill Biden miss stage five metastatic cancer or is this yet another coverup???”There is no such thing as stage five cancer, although it appears to be a sarcastic swipe at Mrs Biden, who has a doctoral degree in education.Dr Ronny Jackson, Trump’s former physician, said the White House was “more concerned about assisting with the political cover up than providing world class medical care.”Some medics have noted that prostate cancer screenings are generally not recommended for men over the age of 70 and that some cancers do not show up in blood and urine samples.Joe Biden corrected himself after accidentally introducing Ukraine\\'s Volodymyr Zelensky as Russia\\'s Vladimir PutinAFP via Getty ImagesAdam Weiner, an urologic surgeon at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, told Al Jazeera: “It is entirely reasonable, albeit sad, that even a person of President Biden’s position may present with a new diagnosis of prostate cancer that is metastatic at his age.”“It is entirely possible he was screened for prostate cancer up to the recommended age and his newly diagnosed prostate cancer first occurred sometime since then.”Mr Biden ran against Trump in the 2024 presidential election before dramatically withdrawing from the race in July amid concerns about his cognitive decline.He was replaced as the Democratic candidate by his vice-president Kamala Harris, who lost the election to Mr Trump in November.Mr Biden’s last physical exam at Walter Reed took place in February last year and was overseen by his personal physician, Dr Kevin O’Connor, who declared the then-president “fit for duty”.\\n```\\n\\n## [Jill Biden reacts to threat of CRIMINAL CHARGES over Biden \\'elder abuse\\'... as family go into hiding...](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14733147/Joe-Biden-cancer-Jill-elder-abuse-backlash.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490) (#32614)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 13:08:40+00:00\\n\\n```\\nEXCLUSIVE\\nJill Biden reacts to threat of CRIMINAL CHARGES over Biden \\'elder abuse\\'... as family go into hiding amid growing claims of cancer coverup\\n02:14, 21 May 2025, updated\\n14:08, 21 May 2025\\nBy\\nHARRIET ALEXANDER FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\\nDarkness had fallen in Delaware and the dire news had been delivered.Joe and Jill Biden sat on the sofa on Sunday night, their green-eyed, grey-coated cat Willow on Jill\\'s lap, and they took a selfie for the nation.The former president smiled widely. His wife looked more forlorn.\\'Cancer touches us all,\\' he captioned the post. \\'Thank you for lifting us up with love and support.\\'Two days on from that photo, the couple is likely feeling significantly less grateful.The initial shock and sadness over the announcement of 82-year-old Joe Biden\\'s advanced prostate cancer has subsided and been replaced with rancor.Even those normally supportive of the Bidens, like major Democrat-backers and media allies, are asking who knew what about the president\\'s health crisis and when, with some pointing an accusatory finger at Dr Jill. Joe and Jill Biden sat on the sofa on Sunday night (above), their green-eyed, grey-coated cat Willow on Jill\\'s lap and they took a selfie for the nation. But even those normally supportive of the Bidens, like major Democrat-backers and media allies, are asking who knew what about the president\\'s health crisis and when, with some pointing an accusatory finger at Dr Jill. Now, Biden insiders exclusively tell the Daily Mail that the president has retreated to familiar surroundings in Wilmington, where he\\'ll be embraced by the community and shielded by a fiercely watchful wife.\\'To understand the Bidens you have to go to Wilmington. It\\'s a small community, it\\'s protective of them,\\' a source with knowledge of the family told the Daily Mail.\\'They have their routine, the coffee shop they go to, the church by the river where they go to mass, you see them at the grocery store,\\' they said. \\'They\\'ll hunker down there. And if anything, the backlash against Joe is only going to make Jill more protective of him.\\'Indeed, many close to the Bidens have refused to respond to the Daily Mail\\'s requests for comment on the president\\'s condition. But on Tuesday, a spokesman released a few new details, claiming that prior to last week Biden had never been diagnosed with prostate cancer and he was last screened for the disease (by routine blood test) in 2014, when he was 72.Whether this additional information quiets critics or encourages more questions - like why a president of the United States would have opted to stop testing for prostate cancer - remains to be seen. And, perhaps unsurprisingly, the woman who has been at Biden\\'s side for decades is now the chief target of critics.\\'Elder Abuse! Criminal Charges??\\' Leo Terrell, a senior counsel to the DOJ\\'s Civil Rights office, posted on social media. \\'She knew about President Biden\\'s health problems. But still wanted him to run for President. Evil,\\' he claimed.\\'This is not the graceful exit they dreamed of,\\' Johanna Maska, a White House aide who worked closely with Biden when he served as vice president, told the Daily Mail.The criticism, she said, stings.\\xa0\\'I know they are sensitive to it. And Joe will be following it all - I don\\'t think there\\'s ever been a moment when he didn\\'t watch the news. He\\'s a product of DC. He cares very much about what\\'s going on,\\'\\xa0Maska said. \\'To understand the Bidens you have to go to Wilmington. It\\'s a small community, it\\'s protective of them,\\' a source with knowledge of the family told the Daily Mail. (Pictured: Biden\\'s Wilmington home) Those who know the Bidens well have also told the Daily Mail that the famously close-knit family is rallying round, trying their best to weather the storm together. But it hurts them, too.Joe and Jill are being supported by his younger sister Valerie Biden Owens, who has been his close political and personal advisor since he successfully ran for the Senate in 1972. Valerie, 79, has been described as her brother\\'s \\'gut check\\': he, in turn, calls her his best friend.The couple\\'s daughter Ashley, a 43-year-old Delaware-based social worker, and son Hunter, the 55-year-old artist and recovering addict, are also frequent visitors to the Wilmington home where Joe and Jill are now holed up, weighing his medical options.Maska reveals that the Bidens will also be leaning on their long-term confidantes - chief among them Mike Donilon, a top Biden confident since 1981, and Antony Blinken, Biden\\'s secretary of state. Anthony Bernal, Jill\\'s right-hand man during her White House years, remains key.\\'They still have the same circle around them,\\' said Maska. \\'They are 100 percent loyalists, whether they are on the payroll or not.\\'However, Maska added that she is concerned about the advice that Biden has received.\\'The Biden top advisors worked to get to what Biden wanted,\\' she said. \\'And that\\'s very different with the Obama orbit. It was expected with Obama that you\\'d provide your direct advice, even when it was in conflict with the boss.\\'Since Sunday\\'s cancer announcement broke, one of the first truly cutting punches came from CNN media analyst Brian Stelter, who suggested that the news amounted to a ploy to distract from the release of both a new book -\\xa0Original Sin, that claims to expose a White House \\'cover-up\\' of Biden\\'s cognitive decline - and leaked audio excerpts of Biden\\'s October 2023 interview with special counsel Robert Hur.Hur was investigating Biden\\'s alleged mishandling of classified information - and the tapes, released on Friday, revealed Biden to be doddering and plagued by memory lapses and confusion throughout the ordeal. Biden insiders exclusively tell the Daily Mail that the president has retreated to familiar surroundings in Wilmington, where he\\'ll be embraced by the community and shielded by a fiercely watchful wife. The couple\\'s daughter Ashley (pictured), a 43-year-old Delaware-based social worker, and son Hunter, the 55-year-old artist and recovering addict, are also frequent visitors to the Wilmington home where Joe and Jill are now holed up. \\'The Biden family always supported their network when there was a cancer diagnosis, whatever happened. I\\'m quite confident that\\'s what the Biden family wants right now,\\' a former aide said. \\'The timing is just extraordinary,\\' said Stelter.Then on Monday morning, former Biden medical advisor and renowned oncologist Dr Ezekiel Emanuel said he believes Biden likely had cancer at the very beginning of his presidency, in 2021, and perhaps even earlier.\\'I don\\'t think there\\'s any disagreement about that,\\' Emanuel told a shocked-looking Joe Scarborough, host of MSNBC\\'s Morning Joe. \\'He\\'s had this for many years, maybe even a decade, growing there and spreading.\\'While Hunter is yet to publicly address the diagnosis, Ashley Biden posted a photo of her father on Instagram, writing: \\'The strongest fighter I know: The best fighter there ever was. I will be by his side through it all. Like he has been in mine every single day of my life.\\'For her part, the Bidens\\' granddaughter Naomi, 31, called Original Sin \\'uninspired lies\\' and accused its authors Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson of peddling \\'political fairy smut for the permanent, professional chattering class.\\'And Maska, the former Obama White House staffer, said that the Bidens will at least draw strength from the network of those they\\'ve helped with their own cancer diagnoses.\\'I remember when my Obama colleague Brandon Lepow was diagnosed with aggressive cancer, Joe Biden called him offering both his support and advocacy,\\' Maska said.

The list goes on and on,\\' she said.The program assigns\\xa0federal air marshals to follow US citizens who pose an \\'elevated risk to aviation security\\' through airports and on flights. Tulsi Gabbbard and her husband (pictured together) were stopped and subjected to further TSA testing every time they went to the airport after she was placed on the list Gabbard revealed she was first placed on the watchlist in late July, 2024 - just one day after she publicly criticized the newly appointed Democratic presidential nominee, Kamala Harris As a result, there\\'s at least five agents would be following her and keeping a close eye on every flight she takes.Gabbard noted that the Quiet Skies program has never once caught a terrorist.She said: \\'This program has been going on for nearly two decades... not a single terrorist has been caught. For as long as this program has existed.\\'Every single day, 40 to 50 federal air marshals are tasked with surrveiling everyday Americans for no purpose, these arbitrary reasons put forward.\\'In her case, she said once Republicans began asking questions about the reasons she was placed under surveillance, \\'the TSA started changing their story and\\xa0making things up about why they were justified putting me on this list.\\'Despite any of the excuses which have been offered, Gabbard said it was abundantly clear to her that it was linked to her criticism of Harris.She had spoken from Rome to Fox about how \\'Harris would be dangerous for our country\\'s security, the safety, security and freedom of the American people if she were to become Commander-in-Chief.\\'The next day, she and her husband arrived at the airport to return home to the United States.\\xa0 Three sources said Gabbard\\'s overseas travel patterns as well as her connections to certain foreign entities had triggered the government algorithm which tries to identify security risks Gabbard, a Trump ally, slammed the former administration for wasting resources on monitoring her They were immediately put through rigorous security testing and from that moment onwards, every single time she arrived at the airport she was taken for further questioning, which would take upwards of 40 minutes every time.On some occasions, she would be required to go through the process multiple times for a single flight, all while being assured she had been \\'randomly selected.\\'Gabbard had been in the Vatican conducting meetings, including with other Americans who were never put on any such lists or treated with the same hostility.Three sources told CNN at the time that Gabbard\\'s\\xa0overseas travel patterns as well as her connections to certain foreign entities had triggered the government algorithm which tries to identify security risks.At least two of the sources denied her theory that she was targeted because of her criticism of Harris. Instead, they argued that while in the Vatican, she attended an event in the Vatican hosted by a person on an FBI watchlist.\\'The only difference was they were not on your show the day before traveling back to the United States, or any show for that matter, publicly criticizing then-Vice President Kamala Harris,\\' Gabbard told Ingraham.Republican Senator Rand Paul had earlier on Tuesday confirmed Gabbard\\'s presence on the watch list.\\'Just last night, I received the first set of records from the department regarding Tulsi Gabbard\\'s placement on the TSA Quiet Skies watch list,\\' Paul said. During her stint on this highly secretive watch list, Gabbard\\'s appearance, the amount of electronic devices she was using, and the identity of any person she met on her travels was documented and reported back to the government Gabbard noted that the Quiet Skies program has never once caught a terrorist \\'These documents confirm our suspicions.

These voters are also notoriously difficult for pollsters to reach, making it challenging to track their exact impact.\\nMy favorite and most hilarious part of the article came when Igielnik actually wrote:One inevitable complication in understanding how attention paid to stories in the news corresponds with political support is that consumers can design a media diet of information from only one side or perspective.

A political appointee demanded a redo, then pushed for changes to the new analysis, too.In a March 24 email, Joe Kent, chief of staff to Tulsi Gabbard, said that it was necessary to “rethink” the intelligence assessment, according to multiple people who described it.Credit...Rod Lamkey/Associated PressMay 20, 2025New emails document how a top aide to Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, ordered analysts to edit an assessment with the hope of insulating President Trump and Ms. Gabbard from being attacked for the administration’s claim that Venezuela’s government controls a criminal gang.“We need to do some rewriting” and more analytic work “so this document is not used against the DNI or POTUS,” Joe Kent, the chief of staff to Ms. Gabbard, wrote in an email to a group of intelligence officials on April 3, using shorthand for Ms. Gabbard’s position and for the president of the United States.The New York Times reported last week that Mr. Kent had pushed analysts to redo their assessment, dated Feb. 26, of the relationship between Venezuela’s government and the gang, Tren de Aragua, after it came to light that the assessment contradicted a subsequent claim by Mr. Trump. The disclosure of the precise language of Mr. Kent’s emails has added to the emerging picture of a politicized intervention.The final memo, which is dated April 7 and has since become public, still contradicts a key claim that Mr. Trump made to justify sending people accused of being members of the gang to a notorious Salvadoran prison without due process.Emails on the topic from Mr. Kent, who is also Mr. Trump’s pending nominee to lead the National Counterterrorism Center, have circulated within the intelligence community and were described by people briefed on them. Mr. Kent’s interventions have raised internal alarms about politicizing intelligence analysis.Defenders of Mr. Kent have disputed that his attempted intervention was part of a pressure campaign, arguing he was trying to show more of what the intelligence community knew about the gang.But the disclosure of his emails supports the accounts of critics who said he was applying political pressure to generate a torqued narrative that would support, rather than undermine, the administration’s policy agenda.The issue centers on Mr. Trump’s invocation in March of a rarely used wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act, to summarily deport people accused of being members of the gang. After several planeloads of such transfers, courts have blocked any further use of the law for now.ImageThe White House invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants it accused of being members of a violent gang.Credit...Jesus Vargas/Getty ImagesThe act, enacted in 1798, allows the government to remove citizens of a country that is in a declared war with the United States or otherwise invading U.S. territory. On its face, it appears to require a linkage to the actions of a foreign state, and Mr. Trump summoned such a link into existence in a proclamation on March 15.“TDA is undertaking hostile actions and conducting irregular warfare against the territory of the United States both directly and at the direction, clandestine or otherwise, of the Maduro regime in Venezuela,” Mr. Trump declared, referring to the gang. “I make these findings using the full extent of my authority to conduct the Nation’s foreign affairs under the Constitution.”But the U.S. intelligence community believes that the opposite is true: The gang is not controlled by the administration of Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, nor committing crimes in the United States at its direction, according to the two assessments by the National Intelligence Council.The council is an elite internal think-tank that reports to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. It undertakes analytical projects at the request of policymakers, relying on information collected by agencies like the C.I.A., the F.B.I. and the National Security Agency.The White House requested the original assessment in February as it was preparing Mr. Trump’s Alien Enemies Act proclamation. Even after the council produced its first assessment, Mr. Trump proceeded to sign the proclamation that put forward the opposite claim in order to activate wartime deportation powers.The disconnect first came to light in a March 20 Times article that reported on the existence of the Feb. 26 memo and detailed why the intelligence community had reached its conclusion. The Times also reported that the F.B.I. partly dissented and thought there were some links between the gang and Venezuela’s government based on information that the rest of the country’s spy agencies thought was not credible.The Trump administration reacted with alarm to the disclosure of the intelligence assessment. On March 21, a Friday, Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general — who is also a former criminal defense lawyer for Mr. Trump — issued a statement saying the Justice Department was opening a criminal leak investigation while also portraying the Times article as inaccurate.The following Monday, March 24, Mr. Kent sent an email to several people, including Michael Collins, then the acting head of the National Intelligence Council. Attaching a copy of the Times article to his message and telling the team to look at it, Mr. Kent said it was necessary to “rethink” the assessment, according to multiple people who described it.“Flooding our nation with ‘migrants’ and especially ‘migrants’ who are part of a violent criminal gang is the action of a hostile nation, even if the gov of Venezuela isn’t specifically tasking or enabling TDA’s operations,” Mr. Kent wrote, according to the people briefed on the email.Mr. Kent’s comment that the Maduro administration wasn’t “tasking or enabling” the gang’s operations appears to be a concession that Mr. Trump’s claim might be doubtful. But Mr. Kent doubles down on the idea that Venezuela had taken advantage of Biden-era immigration policies to allow migrants, including gang members, into the United States.Mr. Kent wrote that the council needed to produce a new assessment on the topic that would reflect “basic common sense” by the end of the week, saying he wanted to understand how any agency had concluded that Venezuela’s government was not orchestrating Tren de Aragua’s actions in the United States.The precise language of Mr. Kent’s March 24 email was reported earlier by Reuters.Mr. Collins agreed to start work on a new council assessment, according to the people familiar with the exchange.Mr. Collins and Mr. Kent exchanged several emails on April 3 and April 4. But in one long email on April 3, Mr. Kent asked for changes, arguing that it wrongly, in his view, made it sound as if the Venezuelan government had no connections to the gang.“Let’s just come out and say TDA leaders are given sanctuary in Venezuela as their gang members commit horrendous crimes in America, then we can provide the context about our exact knowledge of relationship between TDA and the Venezuelan government,” Mr. Kent wrote. He also argued the assessment did not do enough to describe the situation on the border and Biden administration policies that he believed had made it too easy for migrants to enter the United States. He characterized former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as having announced that the border was open and having turned Customs and Border Protection into a “travel service for illegals.” “TDA didn’t need logistical support from the Venezuelan government because Biden provided it for them,” Mr. Kent wrote. “I understand some may view this as political, but it’s not.”Mr. Kent ended the email by writing he wanted a version by the end of the week that could be declassified and provided to the White House team led by Stephen Miller, the architect of the Trump administration’s anti-immigration policy.ImageTulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, has since fired Michael Collins and his deputy at the National Intelligence Council, bashing them as biased, deep-state bureaucrats.Credit...Eric Lee/The New York TimesOn April 3 and 4, in a series of emails, the two men collaborated on various proposed edits to the document, Mr. Kent pushing for more about the impact of border policy on migration, and Mr. Collins agreeing to some edits. Officials from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment on Tuesday.The intelligence community broadly thinks, according to the publicly released assessment, that Venezuela’s government “probably does not have a policy of cooperating with TDA and is not directing TDA movement to and operations in the United States.” F.B.I. analysts agree with that assessment, the memo said, but also think that “some Venezuelan government officials facilitate TDA members’ migration” and use them as proxies to destabilize the United States and undermine public safety.The basis for the F.B.I.’s partial dissent, however, comes from statements made in custody by migrants who were arrested in the United States — and “most” of the intelligence community “judges that intelligence indicating that regime leaders are directing or enabling TDA migration to the United States is not credible,” the memo said.Among other reasons, it cited a lack of corroboration from any communications and funding flows that spy agencies would expect to collect if such coordination were happening, it said.The memo also contradicted Mr. Kent’s premise, in the March 24 email, that Venezuela’s government was deliberately sending migrants to the United States, bad actors or otherwise. Rather, it said, Venezuelans were migrating “voluntarily, often at great personal risk, to flee political instability and near-collapse of Venezuela’s economy.”Mr. Kent is said to have reacted happily to the final version of the second memo and ordered it declassified so that it could be discussed publicly, setting in motion a chain of events that led to its public release on May 5 in response to a Freedom of Information Act request.Notwithstanding Mr. Kent’s happiness with Mr. Collins’s final work, the second memo still contradicts what Mr. Trump said and its official disclosure has been a legal and political problem for the Trump administration. Ms. Gabbard has since fired Mr. Collins and his deputy at the National Intelligence Council, bashing them as biased, deep-state bureaucrats.Charlie Savage writes about national security and legal policy for The Times.Julian E.

Axios’ Alex Thompson and CNN’s Jake Tapper released “Original Sin” Tuesday, and the book is based on more than 200 interviews with Democratic Party and White House insiders.The sources detail just how bad Biden’s decline reportedly was while he was president. The book alleges Biden’s aides staged a town hall in Delaware with a friendly audience so they could video it for campaign ads, according to Axios. But instead they were left with over 90 minutes of unusable footage, the outlet noted. “The man could not speak,” one person involved said, according to Axios. Some sources blamed “the gym’s lighting for the event being a dud,” but others were confident it was the former president’s performance, the book reportedly detailed.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) The fumbled town hall was allegedly not the only time the campaign struggled to get workable footage of Biden. The book alleged that when groups backing the former president would ask for five minute footage of the 82-year-old, the White House would only have one or two minute videos to share, according to Axios. The campaign often used two cameras rather than one to mask edits or fumbled lines, the outlet added. (RELATED: Joe Biden Posts Videos Chock Full Of Edits While White House Decries ‘Cheap Fakes’) “Even with such accommodations, videos sometimes were unsalvageable. In some cases, the heavy edits were so obvious that campaign staffers regretted putting them out,” Axios wrote of the book’s alleged findings. Donald Trump lost two debates to me in 2020. Since then, he hasn’t shown up for a debate. Now he’s acting like he wants to debate me again. Well, make my day, pal. pic.twitter.com/AkPmvs2q4u — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) May 15, 2024 “Every shoot was anxiety-inducing for Biden’s team,” Tapper and Thompson reportedly wrote in “Original Sin.” In the week leading up to the release of their book, Tapper and Thompson rolled out multiple excerpts. One excerpt alleged aides were considering putting Biden in a wheelchair post-election, and another alleged the former president didn’t recognize his longtime friend George Clooney. Two days before the book was set to publish, the 82-year-old’s staff announced he had been diagnosed with an “aggressive form” of prostate cancer. Now, there is speculation around Biden’s cancer diagnosis as doctors and cancer experts previously told the Daily Caller that Biden likely had cancer while he was still in the White House. The type of cancer he has, in which the metastastization from prostate cancer spreads to the bones, generally takes five years or more to develop, according to experts. “It’s not credible that we are hearing of his metastatic disease for the first time because he was having difficulty urinating and they found it. That just doesn’t track,” Dr. Steven Quay, a physician, scientist and member\\xa0of the American Association for Cancer Research, told the Caller. Amid the revelations about Biden’s decline during his time in the White House, President Donald Trump suggested his diagnosis was a part of a larger conspiracy. Trump also wrote in a Truth Social post on Tuesday that it wasn’t his predecessor that destroyed the country, rather it was his staff around him who “knew he was cognitively impaired.” “It wasn’t his idea to Open the Border, and almost destroy our Country, and cost us Hundreds of Billions of Dollars to get criminals out of our Country, and go through the process we are going through now. It was the people that knew he was cognitively impaired, and that took over the Autopen. They stole the Presidency of the United States, and put us in Great Danger,” Trump wrote.\\n```\\n\\n## [Begala: Democrats\\' Credibility Isn\\'t Hurt at All by Biden Decline, They Were \\'Hoping That He Was Doing Fine\\'](https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2025/05/20/begala-democrats-credibility-isnt-hurt-at-all-by-biden-decline-they-were-hoping-that-he-was-doing-fine/) (#35727)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 04:08:17+00:00\\n\\n```\\nOn Tuesday’s broadcast of NPR’s “All Things Considered,” CNN Contributor and Democratic strategist Paul Begala said that the revelations about then-President Joe Biden’s mental fitness don’t impact the credibility of the Democratic Party at all and “I don’t think any Democrat who’s going to be facing voters in the midterms was at all complicit.” And there were “a whole bunch of politicians who understandably were rooting for him and hoping that he was doing fine, but they didn’t know.”\\nCo-host Mary Louise Kelly asked, “What does this mean to your party’s ability to hold President Trump, his administration, and Republicans accountable for policies, for actions you disagree with? Is your credibility shot is the gist of the question.”\\nBegala responded, “Not even dinged. Not a bit. I do think that members of the Biden team misled us. Every breath that Donald Trump takes is mendacious. And, just as a political strategist, we are 531 days from the midterm elections. We’ve got prices going up because of tariffs. We’ve got the biggest cut in Medicaid in the history of the country. It’s inconceivable that anybody will give a rip snort about Joe Biden’s health in 531 days when their own health care is being cut and their prices are going up.”\\nKelly followed up, “You don’t see this as being damaging at all to Democrats who protected him, who will be facing voters in the midterms?”\\nBegala answered, “That’s correct. I don’t think any Democrat who’s going to be facing voters in the midterms was at all complicit. It seemed to me from the book to be a small handful of aides and then a whole bunch of politicians who understandably were rooting for him and hoping that he was doing fine, but they didn’t know.

This opinion was held by millions of Americans en masse during the lengthy preamble to the campaign—understandable, given how the incumbent appeared pallid, doddering, and unsettlingly fragile in his duties as head of state. But, nonetheless, elected Democrats and Democrat-aligned media alike held on to the idea that this octogenarian had some gas left in the tank, so long as he could stand upright. The charade ended during the first presidential debate—where a visibly mummified Biden claimed, among other things, to have “defeated Medicare”—while Trump turned in an uncharacteristically subdued performance. It was officially Joever, and everyone knew it.\\nSince then, the president’s decline, and the (frankly, ongoing) cover-up by abetting aides and family members, has been one of the hottest stories in America. The minute-to-minute particularities of his enfeeblement have been covered with salacious glee, reaching an apogee this week with the release of Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson’s book about the grim pantomiming going on behind the scenes during the final acts of Biden’s presidency. This, combined with the disclosure that the 82-year-old is suffering from an aggressive form of prostate cancer, is bringing about a fitting end to one of the macabre sagas in American history.\\nHow has the liberal establishment responded to the crisis? By telling us, ad nauseum, how stupid they are.\\nI mean listen to these guys. Here is Beto O’Rourke\\xa0solemnly telling Pod Save America that Democrats must admit that they “fucked up, and made a terrible mistake.” Here is California’s Rep. Ro Khanna with some contrition of his own, asserting that it was “painfully obvious” that Biden shouldn’t have run again, and that he and his colleagues “must acknowledge this truth to regain the trust of the American people.” Sen. Chris Murphy told Politico that there was “no doubt” that the president suffered “cognitive decline” in office. “Clearly, in retrospect, we should have done something different,” he added. A similar attitude is pervading liberal media, especially CNN, which employs the tell-all’s author. Van Jones is calling for a flat-out apology brigade from the party, conjuring images of a rowdy town hall chucking rotten tomatoes and beer bottles at, like, Amy Klobuchar.\\nLook, I understand this inclination. The Democratic Party’s cultural status has rarely been worse, and the radioactive unpopularity of Biden—undergirded by his atrophying cognition—is a major element of that swoon. But you know what? As someone who never liked Biden all that much, and thought he was way too old to run for the presidency in 2020 (much less 2024!), allow me to say my piece: Isn’t all of this self-flagellation a little much? Maybe even embarrassing? Of all the sentiments I’d like to be hearing from Democrats right now, a reminder that they think themselves to be utterly useless has to be at the very bottom of the list.\\nTo be clear, if there is any hope of all of us existing in a shared reality again, the acknowledgment that Biden was rapidly accelerating toward incompetence should become the orthodox stance taken by all elected Democratic officials. But that does not mean such a concession needs to be conjoined with this attitude of perpetual, institutionalized failure. The reasons for this are twofold. First, and most important, the idea that the public will reward this prostration with a raft of goodwill is completely bunk, and utterly out of sync with the rules of engagement as we understand them in 2025. (There is a reason Donald Trump never admits defeat!) I don’t know how the Democrats can rehabilitate their image either, but an extremely needy apology campaign—reinforcing their national character as a band of gullible morons most comfortable when they’re losing, afraid to do anything that could be considered bold until there are absolutely zero stakes—is not the path forward. How much moral territory can possibly be ceded when huge portions of the United States government are controlled by former Fox News anchors and TV doctors? How have the Democrats suddenly become the party handcuffed by absolute fealty to a party leader? Especially when, if I remember correctly, Biden was unceremoniously booted from the ticket over the summer once his brain started leaking from his nose for all to see?\\nSecond, if this is the great tentpole issue Democrats intend to brandish in 2028—a suite of insurgent new candidates who boldly believe that Joe Biden was too old—then we are completely screwed. Congratulations! You’re joining a consensus shared by everyone else in the United States. Do you have any other ideas for how you would like your party to be understood? Plans for a more humane health care system? A substantive effort to reduce the gargantuan cost of living? Or, I don’t know, any signs of breaking with Israel’s psychotic Gaza offensive? You know, the many other things that made Biden, regardless of his age, an extremely unpopular president?\\xa0If the party thinks the problems with its brand begin and end with the brittle timbre of an 82-year-old’s voice, then it might never win a national election ever again.\\nGet the best of news and politics\\nSign up for Slate\\'s evening newsletter.\\nDemocrats\\nJoe Biden\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

The NSW premier, Chris Minns, told reporters on Thursday “we’re seeing levels of rise in local tributaries, creeks [and] rivers that we haven’t seen since 1920”.“Many people would have never seen this level of inundation or flooding in their communities,” Minns said.On Thursday evening, NSW police northern regions commander David Waddell announced the third reported death in the floods, which have been brought on by three consecutive days of rain.\\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email\\nHe said the woman, who has yet to be formally identified, was located in Brooklana, west of Coffs Harbour. Her family has been informed.Police earlier said a body, believed to be that of a man in his 30s missing since Wednesday night, was found near Rosewood on Thursday morning. The body of a 63-year-old man was found on Wednesday at a home affected by flood waters on North Moto Road at Moto.The 60-year-old woman had travelled with a police officer towards Coffs Harbour at 7pm on Wednesday night until they reached flood waters at Caramba Road. The officer was in a BMW sedan and could not continue. The woman was in a 4WD and decided to continue after the officer checked the water levels, Wardell said.The woman called 30 minutes later saying she was in trouble near Brooklana, but could not be located after a search. Her vehicle was found on Thursday.Waddell pleaded with people not to enter the flood waters.“It is a really dangerous, once-in-a-lifetime event, and there’s been some tragedy surrounding this death, obviously, the police officer who spoke the woman is very traumatised, and we’re wrapping support services around him.”A man who failed to come home after walking near a flooded road at Nymboida remains missing.Although there were thousands of emergency service workers in the field, Minns said “the number of houses that have been inundated and the number of communities that have been isolated, far exceed the amount of boats, the amount of helicopters, amount of trucks that any government can provide”.There were 2,500 personnel, including 2,200 SES workers, in the field, the NSW emergency services minister, Jihad Dib, said.Flooding in Smithtown on the banks of the Macleay River. Photograph: Gavin PartridgeThe Bureau of Meteorology’s Steve Bernasconi on Thursday afternoon said dangerous flooding would continue, with the mid-north coast experiencing intense rainfall for the third consecutive day.Heavy rainfall was expected around the southern Hunter, Blue Mountains and Southern Highlands later on Thursday.“There is a reprieve from the rainfall, though, for the mid-north coast sometime tomorrow as the system does contract south towards the Victorian border on Friday,” Bernasconi said.“That does not mean that the flood risk for this area is abating at the same rate with possible rises from the rainfall and downstream flooding [are] still being measured and being experienced.”The SES said on Thursday afternoon there were 149 active warnings, including 37 emergency warnings, and 48,000 people were isolated by flood waters.The SES said there had been 600 flood rescues and more than 4,600 calls for assistance.

The NSW premier, Chris Minns, told reporters on Thursday “we’re seeing levels of rise in local tributaries, creeks [and] rivers that we haven’t seen since 1920”.“Many people would have never seen this level of inundation or flooding in their communities,” Minns said.On Thursday evening, NSW police northern regions commander David Waddell announced the third reported death in the floods, which have been brought on by three consecutive days of rain.\\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email\\nHe said the woman, who has yet to be formally identified, was located in Brooklana, west of Coffs Harbour. Her family has been informed.Police earlier said a body, believed to be that of a man in his 30s missing since Wednesday night, was found near Rosewood on Thursday morning. The body of a 63-year-old man was found on Wednesday at a home affected by flood waters on North Moto Road at Moto.The 60-year-old woman had travelled with a police officer towards Coffs Harbour at 7pm on Wednesday night until they reached flood waters at Caramba Road. The officer was in a BMW sedan and could not continue. The woman was in a 4WD and decided to continue after the officer checked the water levels, Wardell said.The woman called 30 minutes later saying she was in trouble near Brooklana, but could not be located after a search. Her vehicle was found on Thursday.Waddell pleaded with people not to enter the flood waters.“It is a really dangerous, once-in-a-lifetime event, and there’s been some tragedy surrounding this death, obviously, the police officer who spoke the woman is very traumatised, and we’re wrapping support services around him.”A man who failed to come home after walking near a flooded road at Nymboida remains missing.Although there were thousands of emergency service workers in the field, Minns said “the number of houses that have been inundated and the number of communities that have been isolated, far exceed the amount of boats, the amount of helicopters, amount of trucks that any government can provide”.There were 2,500 personnel, including 2,200 SES workers, in the field, the NSW emergency services minister, Jihad Dib, said.Flooding in Smithtown on the banks of the Macleay River.

In yet another example of US President Donald Trump taking people by surprise, he declared the climbdown a “historic trade win”.Trump and his supporters claimed a victory by pointing to the pre-April-2 fentanyl-based tariff of 20 per cent on China that remains, by Beijing agreeing to “suspend or remove the non-tariff countermeasures” introduced against the US since April 2 – presumably including the rare earth export controls that threaten to hamper US military and chip industries – and, in Trump’s words, by China deciding to “open itself up to American business”.But the world in general has deemed it a serious setback to Trump’s much-trumpeted agenda, so much so that the Wall Street Journal labelled it a “major retreat”, observing “the China deal is more surrender than Trump victory”. The Guardian calls May 12 – the day the joint statement on the Geneva meetings was released – America’s “Capitulation Day”.However, in achieving a climbdown of this scale without devastatingly denting US credibility and prestige as the world’s sitting superpower, Trump deserves some applause. And he could not have done this without Beijing’s tacit collaboration. After all, China wants its rise to continue peacefully, believing time is on its side.Of course, prospects remain fraught. The 90-day truce is merely a moratorium and, given Trump’s notorious fluidity, no one can confidently predict what will happen in the meantime and how it will end. Still, the world has breathed a huge sigh of relief, for now. Shipping fees have surged as orders are hastily placed. Capital markets are perhaps the clearest indicator: major stock indices including the Dow Jones Industrial, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have recouped their losses this year.Former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers said it all when he opined that “it’s President Trump who blinked” while “China didn’t make any consequential or significant change in its policies”. But he went on to say that “sometimes it’s good to blink” – meaning the embarrassment was worth it as long as the US, and indeed the world, economy benefited.\\n```\\n\\n## [How China’s next 5-year plan hones in on weak links laid bare by trade war](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3311252/chinas-2026-30-plan-works-and-it-addresses-weak-links-exposed-us-trade-war) (#32340)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 14:00:09+00:00\\n\\n```\\nBeijing appears to be planning for a protracted battle with Washington for economic supremacy, with China’s latest five-year development blueprint being drafted to sharpen its competitive edge and address weak links laid bare by the trade war with the United States.President Xi Jinping this week called for public feedback for the nation’s 2026-30 national economic development plan, with an emphasis on science and modernisation, reflecting the strategic thinking of Chinese leaders. A comprehensive catalogue of quantifiable socio-economic goals will be made public in March.Analysts expect China to continue putting greater emphasis on hi-tech advancements, manufacturing resilience and domestic consumption, given the president’s repeated call for “new quality productive forces”, as well as the development of future and frontier industries, while upgrading traditional manufacturing sectors.Meanwhile, Chinese authorities could still set a high target for gross domestic product growth – one of the most watched parameters as China tries to shore up its economy.It is also hoped that the next five years covered by the new plan, the 15th of its kind, will help realise Xi’s goal – first uttered in 2017 – for China to “basically achieve socialist modernisation” by 2035.Subsequent updates of that goal in recent years include targets such as seeing per capita GDP reach the level of moderately developed countries.\\n```\\n\\n## [Nvidia’s Chief Says U.S. Chip Controls on China Have Backfired](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/business/nvidia-china-washington-chip-controls-failure.html) (#33721)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 15:24:49+00:00\\n\\n```\\nAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTYou have a preview view of this article while we are checking your access.

Biden Jr., the U.S. government imposed rules to curb the export of Nvidia’s most powerful chips to China. Nvidia responded by modifying one type of chip, making it less powerful so it would fall below the government’s performance thresholds. Last month, Nvidia disclosed that U.S. officials were requiring a license for future sales of those chips to China, forcing the company to take a $5.5 billion hit on inventory it had already planned to sell.Although Huawei’s chips cannot do everything that Nvidia’s can, they work well enough to help Chinese companies provide A.I. services to people and businesses. In recent months, the government in Beijing has been pushing companies to stock their data centers with mostly Chinese-made chips.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Under former President Joe Biden, the United States rolled out a three-tiered system of export curbs on advanced chips aimed at regulating the global diffusion of AI, blocking China entirely. While Biden said the curbs were necessary to slow China’s development of technology that could have military applications, critics said they could undermine U.S. tech leadership.The Trump administration said last week that it plans to rescind some of those curbs and replace them with its own restrictions.Nvidia’s billionaire chief executive, Jensen Huang, said his company controls 50% of the market in China today, compared with almost 95% at the start of the Biden administration in 2021. “All in all, the export control was a failure,” he told reporters on the sidelines of Computex, a top technology trade show in the Taiwanese capital of Taipei, saying the curbs were based on the “fundamentally flawed” assumption that the U.S. is the only source of AI technology.Huang, 62, said Chinese companies blocked from buying American products had instead turned to local sources such as Chinese tech giant Huawei, and that they had been spurred to make advances with as little outside help as possible. \\xa0“The local companies are very, very talented and very determined,” Huang said, “and the export control gave them the spirit, the energy and the government support to accelerate their development.”Those companies “would love for us never to go back to China,” he said, adding that China is home to 50% of the world’s AI researchers and has an AI market he estimated would be worth $50 billion by next year. Nvidia said last month that it would write off about $5.5 billion in H20 AI chips it had specifically designed for the China market to comply with previous curbs after the Trump administration said those chips would also be restricted.“I really do hope that the U.S. government recognizes that the ban is not effective and give us a chance to go back and win the market as soon as possible,” Huang said.Huang, who was with Trump on his Middle East trip last week along with other tech leaders, lauded the president for his “great reversal” of Biden’s policy, known as the AI diffusion rule, saying Trump “realizes it’s exactly the wrong goal.”“He sees it very clearly that the race is on,” Huang said, “and if the United States wants to stay ahead, we need to maximize, accelerate our diffusion, not limit it, because somebody else is more than happy to provide it.”\\xa0China’s state-led investment in chips has probably exceeded $150 billion over the past decade, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit. Beijing has repeatedly criticized the U.S. over its chip curbs, including guidelines Washington issued last week that said companies anywhere in the world risked violating U.S. export controls if they used advanced Chinese chips such as Huawei’s Ascend without a license. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce said Monday that the U.S. action “seriously undermines” the consensus the U.S. and China reached earlier this month on slashing their tariffs on each other’s goods. On Wednesday, the ministry further accused the U.S. of “abusing export controls to suppress and contain China.” It pledged to invoke China’s anti-foreign sanctions law against anyone involved in enforcing the U.S. move, slamming it as “a typical example of unilateral bullying and protectionism.”Mithil Aggarwal reported from Taipei, and Peter Guo reported from Hong Kong.Mithil AggarwalMithil Aggarwal is a Hong Kong-based reporter/producer for NBC News.Peter GuoPeter Guo is\\xa0a fellow on NBC’s Asia Desk, based in Hong Kong.\\n```\\n\\n## [The great battery race: China and the U.S. compete over the future of EVs](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/21/nx-s1-5388413/china-united-states-electric-vehicle-batteries) (#34993)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 09:00:00+00:00\\n\\n```\\nAn employee holds a full-size prototype LMR battery cell at the General Motors Wallace Battery Cell Innovation Center.

But years ago, as part of a push toward electric vehicles, China took the lead in mass-producing them. Now there\\'s a great race underway to see who will dominate the future of EV batteries. Chinese automakers are announcing newer, better batteries at a breakneck speed, including vehicles promising 5-minute \"flash charge\" times first demonstrated this spring. And, not coincidentally, more than half of new cars sold in China come with a plug. In the U.S., plug-in sales are lower and policies promoting EVs are politically divisive. The Trump administration has started the process of rolling back incentives, infrastructure and requirements encouraging them.\\nBut globally, battery-powered cars remain a crucial part of plans to reduce the catastrophic impacts of climate change, thanks to their smaller carbon footprint. They\\'re also widely believed to be the technology of the future, and companies want to make sure they can compete in tomorrow\\'s auto market as well as today\\'s. So U.S. companies are still feeling intense pressure to improve their battery offerings. Last week, General Motors engineers in Detroit announced a cheaper long-range battery, and work is frantically underway to unlock even more dramatic innovations.\\n\"Unquestionably, the Chinese are ahead in manufacturing technology,\" says Bob Galyen, a retired executive whose long career in automotive batteries spanned both GM and the Chinese battery giant CATL. Today, profits from making batteries are being poured back into R&D in China, he says. \"Clearly, the U.S. is lagging behind.\" But, he says, American labs are still coming up with new ideas: \"There is hope for us.\" In Shanghai, a futuristic auto show\\xa0 To enter the Shanghai Auto Show this spring, first visitors had to pass through facial recognition scanners. It was a taste of the technology on display inside, one of the main reasons why thousands of people, like Shanghai resident Dai Yiyao, flocked to the event.\\nDai was accompanied by his 12-year-old son. \"I brought my kid to see the development, to see what this era is like,\" Dai said. \"He can\\'t be ignorant of it.\" Booth after booth, car company after car company, there was a lot to absorb. Cars that can pivot on the spot. Cars that can operate in water, like a boat. Concept cars with quadcopter rotors. BYD, the world\\'s biggest EV maker by sales and China\\'s top brand, put on display a drone pod that attaches to the roof of a car and opens automatically. A salesman called it \"the world\\'s first drone system only designed for the vehicle.\" The drone, made by the Chinese company DJI, can follow the car automatically, or it can be controlled from inside the car — if there\\'s a traffic jam, the salesman said, you can deploy it to see what\\'s going on ahead of you. A few steps away, BYD was demonstrating what is perhaps a more consequential development: \"flash charging.\" It\\'s car battery charging at 1 megawatt (1,000 kW) — far more power than competitors — with batteries designed to be so efficient that they don\\'t overheat under the high power load.\\nChinese automaker BYD demonstrates high-speed \"flash charging\" at the Auto Shanghai show in spring 2025. Video by John Ruwitch, NPR.\\n\"How fast is it? It can add two kilometers of range per second, or 400 kilometers in five minutes,\" said an engineer on site who declined to be named, citing company policy. That\\'s more than three times faster than U.S. market leader: Tesla\\'s Supercharger. \"Charging a mobile phone is slower. We\\'re faster,\" the engineer said. BYD says it\\'s pioneering fast charging to eliminate anxiety about charge times and limited vehicle range, a major concern for EV owners. It\\'s planning to install 4,000 fast charging stations across China.\\nNone, however, will be installed in the United States. Chinese cars are largely absent from U.S. roads, thanks to a combination of heavy tariffs and U.S. restrictions on web-enabled Chinese car tech. As a result, U.S. consumers can\\'t buy any of the buzzy Chinese EVs on the market — at least, for now. In Detroit, remixing the battery \"recipe\" But while Chinese EVs aren\\'t on U.S. streets, they\\'re very much on automakers\\' minds. Executives from multiple companies have publicly acknowledged that trade barriers can only go so far. Eventually, companies will have to be able to go toe-to-toe with Chinese counterparts on their merits, or risk being relegated to irrelevance on the global market. And that means better EV batteries.\\nNo American company has announced anything like five-minute charging. But companies are very focused on bringing down battery costs to make EVs more affordable — without sacrificing the long range and large vehicles that American buyers prefer. GM\\'s new battery chemistry, announced last week, is designed to do just that. It\\'s a \"lithium manganese-rich,\" or LMR, battery, to be produced in partnership with LG Energy Solutions and deployed in vehicles starting in 2028. Lithium-ion batteries are made up of alternating layers of different chemicals, some of which are more expensive than others. GM says its new battery uses a lot more manganese — which is cheap — and less of pricey materials like nickel and cobalt. GM says the battery can store almost as much energy as today\\'s most expensive EV batteries, but at a cost comparable to the cheapest version, without compromising on lifespan. It\\'s a little bit like if you made a cake cheaper by cutting back on expensive ingredients, like eggs and butter — but changed how you mixed and baked the cake to keep it just as tasty.\\nA battery technician at the General Motors Wallace Battery Cell Innovation Center takes a chemistry slurry sample.\\nSteve Fecht for General Motors/Handout from GM\\nhide caption\\ntoggle caption\\nSteve Fecht for General Motors/Handout from GM\\n\"It\\'s all about: How much of each ingredient, how do you process it, how do you mix it?\" says GM battery engineer Andy Oury. He points out that starting with eggs, milk and butter, you could wind up with anything from scrambled eggs to popovers. The steps you follow determine the final product. In GM\\'s research and development labs north of Detroit, scientists have been working on this new battery recipe for years. Engineers say they\\'ve cracked the right one, and now it\\'s about figuring out how to efficiently produce the battery in huge quantities. That\\'s its own kind of challenge, a little bit like scaling up cake production from a home kitchen to Costco. Leading journalists on a tour of GM\\'s battery labs, Shriram Santhanagopalan, the company\\'s senior manager of advanced battery cell development, pointed through a window into a sealed, humidity-controlled room featuring a waist-high silver metal device with tubes running in and out. It blends chemicals together, kind of like an oversized KitchenAid mixer, he said.\\nThe chemicals do indeed have the texture of batter. They were about to go on a sheet of foil, get baked, then stacked up like a layer cake. (Tesla\\'s process, by contrast, is to roll up the layers like a jelly roll.) Santhanagopalan laughed. \"When we hire people, we say that good cooks make good batteries,\" he said. Bigger breakthroughs are on the horizon The recipe that GM has cooked up is \"exciting,\" says Evelina Stoikou, with the research company BloombergNEF. It should translate directly into longer range, she says, \"which is quite important for consumers.\" Sam Abuelsamid, a longtime auto analyst now with the strategic communications firm Telemetry, says it has other benefits too. For one thing, while China dominates existing battery supply chains, using more of a cheaper input like manganese can make it easier to find alternative supplies, he says: \"You get that lower cost, but also you\\'ve got the ability to source the materials from more places.\" (GM has invested in a company called Element 25 that plans to build a U.S. refinery for Australian-sourced manganese.) At the same time, they both point out, GM\\'s announcement is essentially a tweak to today\\'s battery recipes, offering higher performance at lower cost. It\\'s \"more about optimizing,\" Abuelsamid says, rather than being a \"next-generation\" battery — a radical change in chemistry or design that would lead to dramatically improved performance. Companies around the world are racing to build those, too. They include batteries based on sodium, for instance, which is cheaper and more abundant than lithium. Or \"solid-state\" batteries, entirely made from solid components instead of the liquid electrolyte used in today\\'s batteries. These have gotten particular attention from the industry and the press because of their potential to be safer and cheaper while storing more energy. A variety of companies are trying to perfect one that\\'s ready for use in a mass-market EV.\\nNo one has nailed it yet — although many companies say they\\'re only a few years away. Kurt Kelty is GM\\'s vice president of battery, propulsion and sustainability, after an influential career at Panasonic, Tesla and the battery start-up Sila. He says GM is talking with start-ups about their solid-state technology and continuing to research other radically different battery recipes, while also rolling out more incremental improvements. He acknowledges in the race for new battery tech, China has an advantage. \"Some of these Chinese companies have massive R&D teams and they\\'re getting a lot of funding from their governments,\" he says. \"It\\'s hard to compete against that, but we\\'ve got quite a good, nimble team here.\" At the same time, he points out that the types of batteries that Chinese companies make so well today were developed in the U.S. before being scaled up in Asia, where the companies buying them were located. Things could work out differently this time, he says — if American scientists can keep innovating new battery tech, and big companies can figure out how to commercialize them here and there\\'s enough domestic demand. \"We can build an amazing battery industry here,\" he says. \"We have the opportunity here to really, really accelerate.\" And it\\'s worth noting that while the U.S. and China are competing, there could be room for collaboration, too. Ford is licensing some technology made by Chinese battery maker CATL for use in American-made vehicles. And many battery experts see the potential for more cooperation, when it makes business sense — even if political tensions and trade wars are a major barrier. In Shanghai, a sense of confidence\\xa0 Meanwhile China, which has already built up its domestic battery industry, is in the process of a global expansion. At the Shanghai auto show, reporters and bloggers were flown in from around the world. Bloomberg reported that BYD alone \"hosted some 150 journalists and influencers from Latin America.\"\\nGeo Taveras, an influencer from the Dominican Republic who makes videos about cars and said he had been flown, all expenses paid, to the show by BYD, was filming a demonstration of flash charging. \"This is happening in real time,\" he said. \"I mean, the technology is already developed. You took the same time when you go to the gas station to put gas in your car.\" Chinese EV and battery companies, like BYD, have grown quickly on the back of strong government investment and subsidies. Years ago, the government recognized that batteries were going to be a key sector and made development of a battery supply chain, among other industries, a strategic priority.\\nThe massive subsidies that followed are one reason they\\'ve built such enormous success — although Bob Galyen, who worked for years in China, said it\\'s not the only reason. He said China\\'s experience building consumer electronics for the rest of the world also positioned it for success in batteries — and the \"development and education of the people that go into building batteries,\" including scientists, engineers and factory workers, was also crucial.

About 4.6 billion parcels entered the EU last year, with the vast majority coming from China.Earlier this month President Donald Trump reduced the tariffs on Chinese imports from 120% to 54%, and maintained the flat fee of $100 per postal item for packages worth less than $800.\\nEurope\\'s move is a blow to Chinese fast fashion giants such as Shein and Temu, but less so than ending the \"de minimis\" loophole that had allowed US import duties to be avoided.Customs and Border Protection data shows that de minimis shipments account for more than 90% of all cargo entering the US.Trump\\'s move means consumers cannot expect a return to the golden era of cheap clothes and fast delivery.\\nRebecca Homkes, a lecturer at London Business School, said: \"Consumers will see higher prices and potentially longer shipping times as Shein and others move from direct shipping to sending volumes of goods in containers to the USA to be re-sent from their USA-based warehousing.\"In the meantime, shoppers are likely to face fewer options, longer wait times, and fewer bargains.\"The pain will be suffered by lower-income households who relied on small parcels from abroad to stretch the family budget,\" said Gary C.

It is building plants in Michigan and Illinois that will employ 5,000 American workers.(Zhao Wenyu / China News Service / Getty Images) By James BaconGuest contributor\\xa0 May 21, 2025 9:41 AM PT The United States and China are locked in a standoff with no resolution in sight. The U.S. wants to reshore manufacturing, and China wants to sell its manufactured products into the American market. It will take a creative solution to overcome this impasse, but it’s very possible.President Trump himself has already previewed what a winning formula could look like. During his 2024 campaign, he repeatedly pledged to lure other countries’ factories to the United States. At a rally in Michigan, he said: “China has to build plants here and hire our workers. When I’m back in the White House, the way they will sell their product in America is to build it in America. They have to build it in America, and they have to use you people to build it.”When China began embracing a market economy in the 1970s, its leaders made a similar demand to American companies. In order to get access to the Chinese market, American firms would have to manufacture in China, hire Chinese workers and teach the Chinese the underlying technology. But times have changed. China is no longer America’s pupil. When it comes to automobile and battery manufacturing, Chinese companies are years ahead of their American competition. It’s time for us to learn from them.Gotion Inc., an advanced Chinese battery manufacturer, is currently building two plants in the United States. The Gotion plants in Michigan and Illinois together will employ 5,000 American workers and also train American engineers in the latest lithium battery technology. CATL, another Chinese battery company, is looking to build factories in partnership with American automakers. Their proposed factory in Michigan, a joint venture with Ford, would employ 2,500 Americans.These companies are attempting to build here because they want access to the U.S. market. By building in the U.S., they can avoid tariffs and more easily sell their batteries to American companies. In return, the U.S. gets good-paying jobs, the best batteries in the world and a more advanced manufacturing sector.But instead of embracing this as a victory, Republicans have brutally attacked both Gotion and CATL because they’re Chinese. For them, every company from China is a national security threat, even if there’s no specific evidence against them. According to the hawks, merely being Chinese-owned means the company is part of a covert operation directed by the Chinese government. Evidence to the contrary is simply ignored.In Gotion’s case, they’re a global company whose largest shareholder is Volkswagen; the U.S. operations are run by American executives; and the U.S. plants will be staffed by American workers. In CATL’s case, it won’t own the U.S. plant it helps build, but instead will be licensing technology to Ford, which will own the plant. But when it comes to China, such inconvenient facts are thrown out the window because politicians need to score political points.The China bashing has become so prevalent that Trump has had to clarify his position. At a recent Cabinet meeting, Trump said that he welcomes Chinese investment in the United States, and that he doesn’t understand why some people have the impression that he doesn’t. Of course, people have that impression because his underlings have been working overtime to prevent Chinese companies from investing here. Not only has Trump not slapped them down, but also he contradicted his own position by signing an executive order that makes it harder for the U.S. and China to invest in each other.If this current trajectory continues, there won’t be more Gotions or CATLs announcing investments in America. Trump needs to make it clear that victory in the trade war includes Chinese manufacturers setting up shop here. If he doesn’t, his staff may continue to sabotage what could be openings to defuse tensions with China.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has wisely called for an economic rebalancing with China. That will require adopting a rational approach, not one based on paranoia. It’s time to turn this standoff into a victory.James Bacon was a special assistant to the president during the first Trump administration. More to Read Insights L.A.

Judge Brian Murphy said the removals could violate his order last month barring the US government from sending migrants to third countries without being given \"meaningful opportunity\" to challenge their deportation.In an emergency submission to the judge, immigration attorneys said a flight carrying a dozen people had landed in South Sudan on Tuesday. It is the latest showdown between Trump and the federal courts as the Republican president seeks to deliver on a campaign pledge for mass deportations.Attorneys from the National Immigration Litigation Alliance asked Judge Murphy on Tuesday for an emergency order to prevent the removals, which they said had included citizens of Myanmar and Vietnam. The judge, a Biden appointee who is based in Boston, told a lawyer for the Department of Justice: \"I have a strong indication that my preliminary injunction order has been violated.\"\"Based on what I have been told this seems like it may be contempt\", he added, according to US media.But the justice department lawyer, Elianis Perez, said that one of the migrants, who is Burmese, had been returned to Myanmar, not South Sudan. She declined to disclose where the second migrant, a Vietnamese man, was deported, saying it was \"classified\". She said he had been convicted of murder.At least one rapist was also on the deportation flight, said an attorney for the Department of Homeland Security.Judge Murphy did not order the plane to head back to the US, but said the migrants must remain in the government\\'s custody and be \"treated humanely\" pending a hearing on Wednesday.He said this could entail the deportation flight being kept on the tarmac once it lands.Judge Murphy issued a ruling on 18 April requiring that illegal migrants have a chance to challenge their removal to countries other than their homelands.After reports surfaced that some migrants were going to be sent to Libya, Judge Murphy said any such move would violate his ruling.The BBC has contacted the Department of Homeland Security for comment. Watch: Homeland Security Secretary is asked what \"habeas corpus\" means during a Senate hearingLawyers for the Burmese man, identified only as N.M. in the court filing, said their client speaks limited English and had refused to sign a notice of removal served on him by officials at an immigration detention centre in Texas.On Tuesday morning an attorney emailed the centre after noticing her client was no longer showing up on a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainee locator, says the court filing. She was informed he had been removed from the US.When she asked to which country her client had been removed, the email reply said: \"South Sudan.\"The lawyers said another client, the Vietnamese man, identified only as T.T.P. in court papers, \"appears to have suffered the same fate\".The Vietnamese man\\'s spouse emailed his lawyer and said that the group of around 10 other individuals who were believed to have been deported included nationals of Laos, Thailand, Pakistan and Mexico, Reuters news agency reports.\"Please help!\" the spouse said in an email. \"They cannot be allowed to do this.\"The world\\'s youngest nation, South Sudan endured a bloody civil war soon after its independence in 2011.The US government\\'s travel advisory states: \"Do not travel to South Sudan due to crime, kidnapping, and armed conflict.\"Several countries have been asked by the Trump administration to accept migrant deportations.Earlier this month, Rwanda confirmed it was in such talks with the US, while Benin, Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Eswatini and Moldova have all been named in media reports.The South Sudan deportation case is the latest constitutional clash between two equally powerful branches of government.Another jurist, US District Judge James Boasberg in Washington DC, last month found \"probable cause\" to hold Trump officials in criminal contempt.He ruled they had violated his order to halt deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members who had no chance to challenge their removals.\\n```\\n\\n## [Justice Department pulls civil rights investigations into local police departments](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/justice-department-pulls-civil-rights-investigations-local-police-depa-rcna208230) (#30699)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 14:44:57+00:00\\n\\n```\\nWASHINGTON — The Justice Department is dismissing lawsuits against a number of local police departments and ending investigations into patterns and practices of unconstitutional behavior, officials announced Wednesday.The pullback from police oversight comes amid major change at the Justice Department\\'s Civil Rights Division since the start of the Trump administration and the confirmation of Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, Trump\\'s pick to lead the division.Officials said lawsuits filed during President Joe Biden’s administration against two city police departments — Louisville, Kentucky, and Minneapolis — would be dismissed.Follow live politics coverage hereThe lawsuits followed Justice Department investigations into those two police departments, which described patterns of use of excessive force, discrimination against Black people and free speech violations in both jurisdictions. Those investigations were separate from criminal trials of police officers from those departments, who were charged over the high-profile killings of George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Louisville.So-called pattern and practice investigations are meant to focus not on individual incidents but rather on policies and policing cultures that lead to routine constitutional violations.Then-Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a 2023 statement announcing the results of the Minneapolis investigation that the \"patterns and practices of conduct the Justice Department observed during our investigation ... made what happened to George Floyd possible.\"In a statement Wednesday, Dhillon said, \"Overbroad police consent decrees divest local control of policing from communities where it belongs, turning that power over to unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats, often with an anti-police agenda. Today, we are ending the Biden Civil Rights Division’s failed experiment of handcuffing local leaders and police departments with factually unjustified consent decrees.\"Kristen Clarke, who held Dhillon\\'s position during the Biden administration, responded in a statement Wednesday.“To be clear, these investigations were led by career attorneys, based on data, body camera footage and information provided by officers themselves, and the reforms set forth in consent decrees were carefully negotiated with the full support of law enforcement leaders and local officials,\" she said.Other investigations into policing in Phoenix; Trenton, New Jersey; Memphis, Tennessee; Mount Vernon, New York; Oklahoma City; and the Louisiana State Police will also end.During Trump\\'s first term in office, the Civil Rights Division pulled back on police oversight in cities like Chicago, Baltimore and Ferguson, Missouri, the St. Louis suburb where Michael Brown was killed in 2014.After Joe Biden took office in 2021, the Justice Department rescinded guidance that had been issued by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Two years later, the Justice Department announced the results of its investigations into police in Louisville and Minneapolis in 2023.In statements, Louisville\\'s mayor and police chief said they will move forward with reforms despite the dismissal of the lawsuit.\"We are moving ahead rapidly to continue implementing police reform that ensures constitutional policing while providing transparency and accountability to our community,” Mayor Craig Greenberg said in a statement. “I made a promise to our community, and we are keeping that promise.”The state of Minnesota also conducted an investigation into policing in Minneapolis. The head of the state\\'s Department of Human Rights said their agreement remained in place.“While the Department of Justice walks away from their federal consent decree nearly five years from the murder of George Floyd, our Department and the state court consent decree isn’t going anywhere,”\\xa0Human Rights Commissioner Rebecca Lucero said in a statement. “Under the state agreement, the City and MPD must make transformational changes to address race-based policing. The tremendous amount of work that lies ahead for the City, including MPD, cannot be understated. And our Department will be here every step of the way.”Ken DilanianKen Dilanian is the justice and intelligence correspondent for NBC News, based in Washington.Ryan J. ReillyRyan J.

Trump is returning them to the refugee camps](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/21/us-deports-bhutanese-refugee-stateless-limbo) (#31821)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 12:00:27+00:00\\n\\n```\\nAasis Subedi, a Bhutanese Nepali refugee, finds himself back in the same Nepal refugee camp he spent part of his youth, once again stateless.Last month, Subedi and two dozen community members from across the US were deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers to Bhutan, the tiny Himalayan country where they had never previously set foot. At least four, including Subedi, were immediately rejected by Bhutanese authorities and then expelled to India, where they fled to a refugee camp in Nepal.“I have nothing right now. They brought us in [to Bhutan] without any documents,” he says from one of the three Beldangi refugee camps in the south-east of Nepal, where he is using his father’s cellphone.Subedi had been serving jail time for a third-degree felony offense committed in Columbus, Ohio, before he was put on a plane and deported via New Jersey.Subedi is one of the more than 100,000 Bhutanese Nepalis who fled ethnic cleansing and were made stateless by the Bhutanese government who stripped them of their citizenship rights in the 1980s. Since 2008, more than 90,000 have been resettled in the US.But the Trump administration has upended life for the community.“Bhutan is still not safe for our community members to return [to]. It is a matter of putting our lives at risk … Now, people are going through the cycle of being stateless again,” says Robin Gurung of Asian Refugees United.Several of the deported people are believed to be missing in India.Ice told Global Press Journal that Subedi was deported under a “targeted enforcement operation”. Green card holders – Subedi is a legal permanent resident – can be deported having been found guilty of a serious crime but only after having the opportunity to plead their case in court and once the US government has shown “clear and convincing evidence” that the person can be deported. US laws forbid the deportation of individuals to countries where their safety may be at risk.“Most of the folks who have been deported have already served their time. For me, that is the matter of concern,” says Gurung. “They served their time, they were in their communities, providing for their families, their children, and now they are gone.”Thousands of Bhutanese Nepalis have settled in parts of Ohio and Pennsylvania that faced major economic struggles and population loss due to the 2008 Great Recession. About 8,000 Bhutanese Nepali people now live in Reynoldsburg, a city outside Columbus, making up about one-fifth of the population.Along the suburb’s main thoroughfare, East Main Street, Bhutanese Americans have opened up more than 30 businesses ranging from hair salons to restaurants.“A lot of the community works at local Amazon and FedEx facilities. Those kinds of jobs were very attractive for folks, and the schools in Reynoldsburg are good,” says Bhuwan Pyakurel who came to Reynoldsburg in 2016 and has since become America’s first-ever Nepali-Bhutanese elected official.“Many of those businesses were closed before we came here [and] we came and revived them. Cricket is a big thing for the Bhutanese community when it wasn’t known here in the past. Now the city is in the process of building a new cricket field.”While towns and cities across the Sun belt have grown significantly in recent years, northern states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania and beyond have struggled to retain and attract residents.As a result, immigrants have played an important role in helping local economies grow, creating a tax base for city authorities and adding vibrancy to a region working to shed its Rust belt past. Nextdoor in Pennsylvania, about 40,000 Bhutanese Nepalis live in the cities of Harrisburg and Lancaster. Harrisburg has lost nearly half of its population since 1950, though in recent years that decline has been halted.But now a crippling fear has gripped immigrant communities across the country.Pyakurel, who was elected to Reynoldsburg’s city council in 2019 having lived in a refugee camp in Nepal for 18 years, says he now fields five to 10 phone calls a day from worried local Bhutanese Nepali residents, many asking for guidance.“People are wondering if they should apply for their citizenship or wait for three years, if they should renew certain documentation,” he says. Last month, the Palestinian green card holder and Columbia University student Mohsen Mahdawi was detained at a naturalization interview and deportation proceedings against him were enacted. On 30 April, Mahdawi was released.“Nowadays, I carry my passport with me all the time,” says Pyakurel. “Even though I’m a [city council] representative here, I don’t look like a citizen to many Ice officers.”Subedi came to the US through a government refugee relocation program in July 2016 and had been living and working as a machine operator in Pennsylvania before his arrest in Columbus last July.Now 7,700 miles from home, he has little to do but sit all day in the refugee camp, where he lives in a bamboo-made hut – the very same camp he spent the first two years of his life and where his father still lives. The arrival of him and three others deported from the US caused a stir at the camp, which drew the attention of the Nepali police, who detained him for several weeks as his legal status was investigated.This month, his daughter turns three years old. He says his family has no money to assist him in the refugee camp in part because his wife stopped working when their child was born.He says he doesn’t know if he’ll be able to come back to the US.“I want to come back. I have family, my kids,” Subedi says.“This is the second time we have become a refugee.”\\n```\\n\\n## [Judge challenges US deportation of Asians to conflict-plagued South Sudan](https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3311157/us-faces-legal-challenge-it-deports-asians-conflict-plagued-south-sudan) (#32297)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 03:07:34+00:00\\n\\n```\\nA judge has ordered US officials to appear at an emergency hearing on Wednesday to answer questions about their apparent deportation of immigrants to South Sudan and other countries.A US federal judge ruled late on Tuesday that US officials must retain custody and control of migrants apparently removed to South Sudan in case he ordered their removals were unlawful.US District Judge Brian E. Murphy in Massachusetts issued the ruling after an emergency hearing, after lawyers for immigrants said the Trump administration appeared to have begun deporting people from Myanmar and Vietnam to South Sudan – despite a court order restricting removals to other countries.Murphy said the government must “maintain custody and control of class members currently being removed to South Sudan or to any other third country, to ensure the practical feasibility of return if the Court finds that such removals were unlawful”.While Murphy left the details to the government’s discretion, he said he expected the migrants “will be treated humanely”.Port Isabel Detention Centre in Los Fresnos, Texas.

The US justice department said on Wednesday it will be dismissing oversight agreements reached with the police departments in Louisville, Kentucky and Minneapolis, Missouri.It will also be scraping investigations into police constitutional violations in other cities, including Phoenix and Memphis.The announcement comes just days before the fifth anniversary of the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in 2020 after being arrested outside a shop in Minneapolis, sparking a wave of protests.The police office involved, Derek Chauvin, was convicted of murder charges and is serving a 22 year prison sentence.Announcing the move to roll back the reform efforts, the Department of Justice criticised the Biden administration for enacting \"sweeping\" oversight agreements \"that would have imposed years of micromanagement\" of local police by federal courts.\"We are ending the Biden Civil Rights Division\\'s failed experiment of handcuffing local leaders and police departments,\" said Harmeet K Dhillon, the assistant attorney general of the justice department\\'s civil rights division.The justice department said it will also move to dismiss two lawsuits filed against police in Louisville and Minneapolis that accuse law enforcement in the two cities of unconstitutional police practices.Investigations into several other police departments will also be closed.The Department of Justice under former President Joe Biden had opened civil investigations into 12 state and local law enforcement agencies since 2021.They were a result of mounting public pressure to address instances of police brutality after several high-profile cases of police killings of black Americans, which led to accusations of systemic racism against law enforcement agencies across the US.

Ethical issues arise from sending non-natives to an unsafe region.What To KnowDHS confirmed that eight men were on the deportation flight that left on Tuesday, with McLaughlin repeatedly saying that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was justified in its move, despite the court order, because of the migrants\\' crimes.McLaughlin told reporters that the focus should be on the immigrants\\' American victims, and not the issues surrounding due process for the men.Who Was on the Flight?According to Fox News, two Burmese nationals, Kyaw Mya and Nyo Myint, were on the flight to the African country.Mya was convicted of lascivious acts with a child under 12 and sentenced to 10 years in prison, but was paroled after serving four. Myint was found guilty of first-degree sexual assault of a victim mentally and physically unable to resist and received a 12-year sentence. He also faced an additional charge of aggravated assault-nonfamily strongarm.Both men were apprehended by federal authorities in February.Cuban citizen Enrique Arias-Hierro was arrested by ICE on May 2. He has prior convictions for homicide, armed robbery, false impersonation of an official, kidnapping, and strong-arm robbery.Another Cuban citizen, Jose Manuel Rodriguez-Quinones, was taken into custody by ICE on April 30. His convictions include first-degree murder with a weapon, battery, larceny, as well as possession and trafficking of cocaine.Thongxay Nilakout, a citizen of Laos, was convicted of first-degree murder and robbery and received a life sentence. He was taken into ICE custody in January. Jesus Munoz-Gutierrez, a Mexican national convicted of second-degree murder, was also arrested by ICE earlier this month.Dian Peter Domach, from South Sudan, has been convicted on charges including DUI, possession of burglar\\'s tools and a defaced firearm, resulting in an 18-month sentence, as well as robbery and possession of a firearm, for which he was sentenced to eight years. He was detained by ICE earlier this month.Vietnamese citizen Tuan Thanh Phan has been convicted of first-degree murder and second-degree assault.U.S. District Judge Brian E. Murphy, appointed by former President Joe Biden, had issued an injunction requiring that migrants be given proper notice and an opportunity to contest deportation to third countries.Despite this, reports indicate that nearly a dozen migrants were deported from a Texas detention center without an adequate legal process. Some were allegedly misinformed and denied proper legal recourse, their attorneys said in a filing on Tuesday.The judge has ordered federal officials to appear at an emergency hearing to address these concerns and emphasized that deportees must be treated humanely. He also instructed the government to ensure the feasibility of returning the migrants to the U.S. if the deportations are found to be unlawful.Trump Admin Questioned on South Sudan DealDuring Wednesday\\'s briefing, McLaughlin was asked about the decision to send immigrants to South Sudan, for which the State Department has issued a Level 4 \"Do Not Travel\" warning due to concerns about safety, including ongoing armed conflict.The assistant secretary said it should not be assumed that the African nation was the group\\'s final destination. The group remained in DHS custody for now.When pressed on the agreements being made with countries to accept non-citizens, such as the deal with El Salvador, McLaughlin and acting ICE director Todd Lyons said they could not comment on these and deferred to the State Department on safety concerns.The pair did say that such agreements were necessary, as many countries refuse to accept deportees.\\nFile photo of a vehicle displaying the logo for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\\nGetty Images\\nWhat People Are SayingImmigration attorney Jonathan Ryan, in his interview with Newsweek: \"The government, they cherry-picked these people because they have criminal records, because they will be unpopular to the public, so that they can use them as tools to evade what\\'s really going on, which is the potentially criminal contempt for a federal judge\\'s order, for curtailing and eroding constitutional rights and legal rights.\"DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin told reporters at a press conference: \"These heinous individuals have terrorized American streets for too long. Every single one of them was convicted of a heinous crime.\"American Immigration Council senior fellow Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, on X, formerly Twitter: \"The DHS officials continue to refuse to say whether the men are going to be sent to South Sudan, with Tricia McLaughlin saying that maybe once the plane lands in South Sudan, it might go somewhere else after that?

There\\'s a lot to unpack in this case.\\nTo begin at the beginning: On Tuesday, a federal district judge, Brian E. Murphy, ordered the Department of Homeland Security to maintain custody of any illegal aliens being deported to a third-party nation — that is, a nation that is neither the United States nor the home country of the persons in question. Of particular note were eight illegal aliens from Vietnam, Mexico, Cuba, Myanmar, and other places. All have been convicted of serious crimes and were to be deported to detention in South Sudan. Deportation flights for these illegals have, for the moment, halted.You can view that order here. It appears to focus on the details of removal, how much notice each illegal was given, and whether they were able to appeal their removal. An additional hearing is being conducted Wednesday morning before Judge Murphy, as of this writing.\\xa0A Fox News piece briefly described the eight criminals in question.A Biden-appointed federal judge could decide Wednesday morning that a plane carrying illegal immigrants convicted of serious crimes to South Sudan has to return.\\xa0The plane is carrying eight men – all of whom convicted of crimes ranging from homicide to robbery, according to details exclusively provided by the Department of Homeland Security. The DHS unveiled details of the crimes after U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy threatened to order the return of the migrants at a Wednesday hearing.\"No country on earth wanted to accept [the migrants] because their crimes are so uniquely monstrous and barbaric,\" Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said at a press conference Wednesday. \"These heinous individuals have terrorized American streets for too long.\"\"While we are fully compliant with the law and court orders, it is absurd for a district judge to try to dictate the foreign policy and national security of the United States of America,\" McLaughlin said.\\nWatch Tricia McLaughlin\\'s complete statement:BREAKING: Trump administration announces heinous illegal aliens flown to South Sudan, a district judge now seeks their return @TriciaOhio pic.twitter.com/32mEfqIgIh— Florida’s Voice (@FLVoiceNews) May 21, 2025Ms. McLaughlin states in part:\\xa0While we are fully compliant with the law, and court orders, it is absolutely absurd for a district judge to try to dictate foreign policy and national security of the United States of America.Also on Wednesday, Fox News\\' Bill Melugin had more details as to the goblins in question:NEW: ICE identifies the 8 aliens on the South Sudan deportation flight manifest.

DHS will sometimes remove aliens to third party countries if their home countries won\\'t cooperate with deportations. A Mexican being on this flight is a bit puzzling. A federal judge in Boston has ordered DHS to maintain custody of the men in case he rules that the flight is illegal/violated his court order.\\nThis is where things stand: The illegal alien criminals in question, most notably the eight that were headed to South Sudan, will, for the time being, remain here in the United States.See Also:\\xa0Tim Walz Despicably Compares ICE to the Gestapo—Has Apparently Never Read a History BookUS Attorneys in Sanctuary Jurisdictions Want to Sign on to Bill Essayli\\'s \\'Guardian Angel\\' Task ForceNote that the eight men who are the specific subjects named here are not just illegal aliens. They have committed heinous crimes, far beyond just the fact of their illegal entry. These monsters have preyed on American citizens, and the Trump administration is correct to seek their removal, but in several of these cases, the criminals\\' home nation won\\'t accept their return. South Sudan, granted, is an eyebrow-raising choice of destinations, but as of this writing, it\\'s unclear if that was the final destination for these criminals.The Constitution gives the Executive branch broad powers over foreign relations and immigration. This isn\\'t the first time a judicial decision has attempted to interfere with those powers, and it\\'s not stretching a point to observe that this is a constitutional crisis in the making, especially when we note that no such objections were raised during the Obama administration, when millions of illegal aliens were deported.\\nThis is a developing story. We will bring you updates as events warrant.\\nThanks to President Trump, illegal immigration into our great country has virtually stopped.

Murphy wrote that the defendants must answer several questions during an upcoming hearing scheduled for Wednesday, including the amount of notice each migrant received ahead of their attempted removal to South Sudan and any details about their current whereabouts.The order came in response to an emergency request from the lawyers for a group of migrants who asked Murphy to intervene after indications that federal immigration authorities may have deported up to a dozen immigrants from Myanmar, Vietnam and other countries to South Sudan.🏛️Follow PoliticsA federal immigration officer confirmed that at least one immigrant from Myanmar had been deported Tuesday morning to the African nation, according to court records. The spouse of a man from Vietnam said he told her that he and at least 10 others had also been flagged for deportation to that country.Lawyers for the immigrants argued in court records that the hasty removals would violate Murphy’s orders barring the government from deporting people to countries where they are not citizens without giving them a chance to challenge that decision. They asked the judge, based in Massachusetts, to order their immediate return. The allegations come weeks after DHS acknowledged that South Sudan has been engaged in an “ongoing armed conflict” and after a United Nations official warned that the country was at risk of slipping back into civil war.After reports indicated that U.S. immigration officers were preparing to deport people from Vietnam, Laos and the Philippines to Libya, Murphy earlier this month had warned that the Trump administration could not deport immigrants to any country where they are not citizens without due process. He said at the time that such a move would violate standing court orders intended to shield people from being expelled to countries where they could be harmed or killed.Skip to end of carouselTrump presidencyEnd of carouselThe migrant from Myanmar who was sent to South Sudan was among the group that the Trump administration tried to deport to Libya, lawyers said in Tuesday’s filing. DHS and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Lawyers for the migrants say their clients were not provided meaningful notice or a chance to raise concerns about potential harm they could face in South Sudan. One migrant was also exclusively provided a notice in English, even though their proficiency in English is limited. Tuesday’s filing said both migrants refused to sign the notices.The filing also said that the notices did not include information “about whether or how he could seek protection based on fear of deportation to South Sudan, a country currently experiencing civil war and which Defendants themselves have designated for temporary protected status.”Jintak Han, Adam Taylor, Marianne LeVine and Dan Lamothe contributed to this report.\\n```\\n\\n## [Judge Orders U.S. to Keep Custody of Migrants Amid Claims They Were Sent to South Sudan](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/politics/trump-immigration-deportations-south-sudan.html) (#34405)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 12:07:24+00:00\\n\\n```\\nAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTYou have a preview view of this article while we are checking your access.

The Trump administration has turned to countries to take on migrants from countries around the globe, and not necessarily their home country.Credit...Andrew Harnik/Getty ImagesMay 20, 2025A federal court ordered the Trump administration on Tuesday to maintain custody of migrants on a deportation flight that immigrants’ lawyers said was headed to South Sudan, a transfer the judge said appeared to violate an injunction he issued in April.“I am not going to order that the plane turn around,” said the judge, Brian E. Murphy of the Federal District Court in Boston. Instead, he said, any migrants in Department of Homeland Security custody must not leave U.S. control once the plane landed, at least until a hearing Wednesday to determine whether they had received adequate due process.The order capped a tumultuous hearing hastily called by the judge, during which Trump officials said they could not say where the flight was or where it was going.Judge Murphy repeatedly expressed concerns that the administration had violated his order not to deport immigrants to countries where they are not from and may face danger without giving them enough time to challenge their removal. And he warned that officials involved in the deportations who were aware of his order, including potentially the pilots of the plane, could face criminal sanctions. “Based on what I have been told,” he said, “this seems like it may be contempt.”The question of whether the Trump administration defied his previous order added to the remarkable series of faceoffs it has had with the judicial system as President Trump has aggressively pursued his promises of mass deportations. In case after case, judges have rebuked the administration for not allowing adequate due process, and Trump officials in turn have questioned the authority of courts to hear such disputes and even called for the impeachment of judges who rule against it.Immigration lawyers at the hearing on Tuesday said at least two migrants had been told they were going to be deported to South Sudan, a violence-plagued country in Africa that the State Department advises Americans not to travel to.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Well, habeas corpus is a constitutional right that the president has to be able to remove people from this country, suspend their rights. Let me. Let me stop you, ma’am. Habeas corpus. Excuse me. That’s incorrect. Habeas corpus. Excuse me. Habeas corpus is the legal principle that requires that the government provide a public reason for detaining and imprisoning people. So, Secretary Noem, do you support the core protection that habeas corpus provides. Yeah, I support habeas corpus. I also recognize that the president of the United States has the authority under the Constitution to decide if it should be suspended or not. It has never been, let us be clear. It has never been done. It has never been done without approval of Congress. Even Abraham Lincoln got retroactive approval from Congress.During a Senate hearing, Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, falsely described habeas corpus as the president’s “constitutional right” to deport people.CreditCredit...Haiyun Jiang for The New York TimesPublished May 20, 2025Updated May 21, 2025, 7:00 a.m. ETMembers of the Trump administration have spoken recently about possibly suspending a foundational principle of the Constitution, habeas corpus, which protects people from unlawful detention.Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, incorrectly described it in a Senate hearing on Tuesday as the president’s “constitutional right” to deport people.Ms. Noem also said that she thought the president had the authority to suspend habeas corpus, an action that has been weighed by Trump officials, though legal experts say that can only be done by Congress. Here’s how habeas corpus works:What does habeas corpus do?Habeas corpus, which is enshrined in the first article of the Constitution, helps ensure that people are not detained without valid legal grounds.If someone believes a person is being illegally detained, they can ask a judge to issue a “writ” of habeas corpus — basically a court order — demanding that the party detaining the person bring them into court and prove that they have the authority to do so. If the judge finds that they do not, the detainee must be set free.Amanda Tyler, a constitutional law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, called habeas corpus “one of the single most foundational aspects of American law and the American constitution.”“What it does is empower courts to protect individual liberty,” Professor Tyler said. “It’s hard to imagine what could be more central to the role of courts in our constitutional structure.”Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

The move comes only days before the anniversary of the murder of George Floyd in Minnesota nearly five years ago by Derek Chauvin, a white police officer. Chauvin was captured on video pressing his knee onto Floyd\\'s neck for more than 9 minutes as Floyd lay on the pavement face-down and handcuffed. The killing of Floyd, a Black man, incited protests across the country against police brutality and racial injustice. Chauvin was later convicted on murder and federal civil rights charges.\\nHarmeet Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, announced the plan to dismiss the lawsuits, close the underlying investigations and retract findings by the Biden administration\\'s Justice Department about alleged constitutional violations. Dhillon told reporters Wednesday the timing of the move had nothing to do with the solemn anniversary of Floyd\\'s death, but rather looming deadlines in court cases. \"Today, we are ending the Biden Civil Rights Division\\'s failed experiment of handcuffing local leaders and police departments with factually unjustified consent decrees,\" Dhillon said in a written statement. She said those sweeping deals amounted to \"micromanagement\" of local police, that would carry a price tag of potentially millions of dollars in compliance. Dhillon says there\\'s already a court-ordered regimen in place in Minneapolis with the Minnesota Department of Human Rights that the Justice Department believes \"is more than sufficient.\" Louisville, meanwhile, has agreed to voluntarily hire its own monitor to help the city improve its police practices, she said. \"We think is a great way for local control to lead to necessary reform,\" Dhillon added. About a dozen investigations under Biden The Biden-era Justice Department opened the investigation into the Louisville Metro Police Department in 2021, a year after police shot and killed Breonna Taylor while executing a search warrant at her home.\\nThat probe was one of around a dozen \"pattern or practice\" investigations the department launched during the Biden administration into police departments around the country over allegations of unconstitutional policing.\\nOn Wednesday, the Trump Justice Department said it would retract findings of constitutional violations and close investigations into police in six other jurisdictions: Phoenix, Az.; Trenton, N.J.; Memphis, Tenn.; Mount Vernon, N.Y.; Oklahoma City, Okla.: and the Louisiana State Police. Dhillon said these are just a portion of the federal consent decrees currently on the books. She said the department is reviewing all pending oversight agreements to determine whether they should be scrapped. Dhillon said she is confident the vast majority of police officers and departments act in line with the law. But when they fail to do so, DOJ said it will \"take all necessary action\" to respond to civil rights and constitutional violations, including criminal prosecutions. The head of the department\\'s Civil Rights Division during the Biden administration, Kristen Clarke, defended the investigations during her tenure. \"These investigations were led by career attorneys, based on data, body cam footage and information provided by officers themselves, and the reforms set forth in consent decrees were carefully negotiated with the full support of law enforcement leaders and local officials,\" Clarke said in a statement. \"To wholesale ignore and disregard these systemic violations, laid bare in well-documented and detailed public reports, shows patent disregard for our laws and the Constitution.\" Civil rights advocates also sharply criticized the department\\'s decision to drop the investigations into unconstitutional policing. \"The DOJ under Biden found police were wantonly assaulting people and that it wasn\\'t a problem of \\'bad apples\\' but of avoidable, department-wide failures,\" said Jenn Rolnick Borchetta, the deputy project director on policing at the American Civil Liberties Union. \"By turning its back on police abuse, Trump\\'s DOJ is putting communities at risk.\"\\nCivil rights attorney Ben Crump also slammed the decision, saying \"the DOJ is not just rolling back reform, it is attempting to erase truth and contradicting the very principles for which justice stands.\"\\n```\\n\\n## [Justice Department moves to cancel police reform settlements reached with Minneapolis and Louisville](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/justice-department-moves-cancel-police-reform-settlements-reached-122031644) (#34874)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 15:50:18+00:00\\n\\n```\\nMINNEAPOLIS -- The Justice Department moved Wednesday to cancel settlements with Minneapolis and Louisville that called for an overhaul of their police departments following the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor that became the catalyst for nationwide racial injustice protests in the summer of 2020.The Trump administration also announced it was retracting the findings of Justice Department investigations into six other police departments that the Biden administration had accused of civil rights violations. The moves represent a dramatic about-face for a department that under President Joe Biden had aggressively pushed for federal oversight of police forces it accused of widespread abuses. “It’s our view at the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division under the Trump administration that federal micromanagement of local police should be a rare exception, and not the norm,” Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the division, told reporters. “The specifics of policing policy, hiring, training, management, promotion and internal policies are best made at a local level where there’s local accountability and local control over funding and policy issues,” Dhillon said. Following a scathing report by the Justice Department in 2023, Minneapolis in January approved a consent decree with the federal government in the final days of the Biden administration to overhaul its training and use-of-force policies under court supervision.The agreement required approval from a federal court in Minnesota. But the Trump administration was granted a delay soon after taking office while it considered its options, and on Wednesday told the court it does not intend to proceed. It planned to file a similar motion in federal court in Kentucky.“After an extensive review by current Department of Justice and Civil Rights Division leadership, the United States no longer believes that the proposed consent decree would be in the public interest,\" said the Minnesota motion, signed by Andrew Darlington, acting chief of the special litigation section of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “The United States will no longer prosecute this matter.”The Justice Department announced its decision just before the five-year anniversary of the murder of George Floyd. Then-officer Derek Chauvin used his knee on May 25, 2020, to pin the Black man to the pavement for 9 1/2 minutes in a case that sparked protests around the world and a national reckoning with racism and police brutality.However, no immediate changes are expected to affect the Minneapolis Police Department, which is operating under a similar consent decree with the Minnesota Human Rights Department.Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara reiterated at a news conference Tuesday that his department would abide by the terms of the federal agreement as it was signed, regardless of what the Trump administration decided.The city in 2023 reached a settlement agreement with the state Human Rights Department to remake policing, under court supervision, after the agency issued a blistering report in 2022 that found that police had long engaged in a pattern of racial discrimination.Minnesota Human Rights Commissioner Rebecca Lucero said the state court decree “isn\\'t going anywhere.\" “Under the state agreement, the City and MPD must make transformational changes to address race-based policing,\" Lucero said in a statement. \"The tremendous amount of work that lies ahead for the City, including MPD, cannot be understated. And our Department will be here every step of the way.”In Kentucky, the city of Louisville had reached an agreement with the Justice Department to reform its police force after an investigation spurred by the fatal police shooting of Taylor and police treatment of protesters. The agreement, reached in the closing days of the Biden administration, needed court approval to progress. The consent decree followed a federal probe that found Louisville police engaged in a pattern of violating constitutional rights and discrimination against the Black community.Louisville Mayor Mayor Craig Greenberg said the city remains committed to reforming its police force. “This is not the outcome we hoped for when we stood right here in December and announced the decree,\" he said of the department’s move to dismiss the case. “It is an outcome that we have planned for.”____Richer reported from Washington.

Murphy in Massachusetts ruled late Tuesday that the Trump administration must retain custody and control of those “currently being removed to South Sudan or to any other third country, to ensure the practical feasibility of return” if he finds such removals were unlawful. Lawyers for immigrants said the Republican administration appears to have begun deporting people from Myanmar and Vietnam to South Sudan despite a court order restricting removals to other countries. The judge left the details to the government\\'s discretion, but said he expects the migrants “will be treated humanely.” Attorneys for the migrants told the judge that immigration authorities may have sent as many as a dozen people from several countries to Africa. The lawyers say that violates a court order that people have a “meaningful opportunity” to argue that sending them to a country outside their homeland would threaten their safety. The apparent removal of one man from Myanmar was confirmed in an email from an immigration official in Texas, according to court documents. He was informed only in English, a language he does not speak well, and his lawyers learned of the plan hours before his deportation flight, they said. A woman also reported that her husband from Vietnam and up to 10 other people were flown to Africa on Tuesday morning, attorneys from the National Immigration Litigation Alliance wrote. The lawyers asked Murphy for an emergency court order to prevent the deportations. Murphy, who was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden, previously found that any plans to deport people to Libya without notice would “clearly” violate his ruling, which also applies to people who have otherwise exhausted their legal appeals. Murphy summoned U.S. officials to court Wednesday to identify the migrants impacted, address when and how they learned they would be removed to a third country and what opportunity they were given to raise a fear-based claim. He also ruled that the government must provide information about the whereabouts of the migrants apparently already removed.The Department of Homeland Security and the White House did not immediately return messages seeking comment. South Sudan’s police spokesperson Major General James Monday Enoka told The Associated Press on Wednesday that no migrants had arrived in the country and that if they do, they would be investigated and again \"redeported to their correct country\" if found not to be South Sudanese.Some countries do not accept deportations from the United States. That has led the administration to strike agreements with other countries, including Panama, to house them. The U.S. has sent Venezuelans to a notorious prison in El Salvador under an 18th-century wartime law, an action being contested in the courts. South Sudan has endured repeated waves of violence since gaining independence from Sudan in 2011 amid hopes it could use its large oil reserves to bring prosperity to a region long battered by poverty. Just weeks ago, the country’s top U.N. official warned that fighting between forces loyal to the president and a vice president threatened to spiral again into full-scale civil war.The situation is “darkly reminiscent of the 2013 and 2016 conflicts, which took over 400,000 lives,” Nicholas Haysom, head of the almost 20,000-strong U.N. peacekeeping mission.The State Department’s annual report on South Sudan, published in April 2024, says “significant human rights issues” include arbitrary killings, disappearances, torture or inhumane treatment by security forces and extensive violence based on gender and sexual identity.The Homeland Security Department has given Temporary Protected Status to a small number of South Sudanese already living in the United States, shielding them from deportation because conditions were deemed unsafe for return. Secretary Kristi Noem recently extended those protections to November to allow for a more thorough review.South Sudan\\'s diplomatic relations with the U.S grew tense in April when a deportation row led to the revocation of visas and a ban on South Sudanese nationals.The U.S is one of the biggest donors to South Sudan’s humanitarian aid programs with the total funding in 2024 standing at over $640 million, according to the U.S embassy in South Sudan.___ Associated Press writers Tim Sullivan in Minneaopolis, Elliot Spagat in San Diego and Rebecca Santana in contributed to this report.\\n```\\n\\n## [Justice Department ending probes of Minneapolis and Louisville police departments](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/justice-department-minneapolis-louisville-police-departments/) (#35474)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 15:00:00+00:00\\n\\n```\\nBy\\nMelissa Quinn\\nPolitics Reporter\\nMelissa Quinn is a politics reporter for CBSNews.com.

It will also put an end to proposed accountability agreements with the departments.The Trump administration said the consent decrees proposed by the Biden administration sought to subject the Louisville and Minneapolis police departments to sweeping terms that went beyond accusations of unconstitutional conduct and would have led to \"years of micromanagement\" of local departments.\\nThe federal involvement began following the deaths of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police and Breonna Taylor in a Louisville police shooting in 2020.\"Overbroad police consent decrees divest local control of policing from communities where it belongs, turning that power over to unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats, often with an anti-police agenda,\" Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the Justice Department\\'s Civil Rights Division, said in a statement. \"Today, we are ending the Biden Civil Rights Division\\'s failed experiment of handcuffing local leaders and police departments with factually unjustified consent decrees.\"In addition to taking steps to dismiss the lawsuits against the Louisville and Minneapolis police departments, the Trump administration also said it is closing investigations into police departments in Phoenix; Trenton, New Jersey; Memphis; Mount Vernon, New York; Oklahoma City and the Louisiana State Police. The Trump administration said it is retracting the Biden administration\\'s findings of unconstitutional violations by all of the eight named departments, and is looking into potentially dismissing over a dozen other consent decrees across the country.The Justice Department\\'s decision to drop the lawsuits against the Louisville and Minneapolis departments comes just days before the five-year mark since Floyd\\'s death. Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer, was convicted in state court\\xa0on murder and manslaughter charges for Floyd\\'s killing and went on to plead guilty in a federal civil rights case.In a filing with the federal court in Minnesota in the case against the city of Minneapolis, Justice Department lawyers said that the government \"will no longer prosecute this matter.\"\\n\"After an extensive review by current Department of Justice and Civil Rights Division leadership, the United States no longer believes that the proposed consent decree would be in the public interest,\" the filing, signed by Dhillon and others, reads.Consent decrees were used in federal investigations of law enforcement agencies during the Obama administration as part of a renewed commitment to civil rights issues and accountability in policing. But the Justice Department during the first Trump administration restricted their use. That policy was rescinded during the Biden administration. Then-Attorney General Merrick Garland subsequently opened the investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department.Dhillon, the assistant attorney general, told reporters that consent decrees often set \"unrealistic, idealistic expectations that are simply a recipe for non-compliance and perpetual consent decree hell for jurisdictions.\" But she said if there was a \"case of widespread, systemic racist or otherwise excessive-force situations happening despite training, despite litigation, despite local law enforcement taking these issues on,\" consent decrees \"might be an appropriate vehicle.\"\"Theoretically, we are not ruling it out,\" she added.The yearslong examination by the Justice Department into the Minneapolis Police Department was launched in 2021, in the wake of Floyd\\'s death, and found that the Minneapolis Police Department disproportionately targeted Black and Native American people in law enforcement activity and used unjustified force in many instances.\\nThe probe was undertaken to determine whether the department engaged in a \"pattern or practice\" of unconstitutional or unlawful policing. That civil investigation was separate from a federal criminal probe into Floyd\\'s death, which led to convictions of three Minneapolis police officers who were found to have failed to step in to stop Chauvin\\'s use of force against Floyd.Investigators had recommended nearly 30 remedial measures and improvements for Minneapolis to implement to combat racial disparities and excessive use of force by the department, such as enhanced training and accountability measures, and improved data collection of police activity.The city of Minneapolis and the Justice Department had entered into an agreement in principle to reach a court-authorized consent decree, which would have formalized the federal findings and recommendations, and appointed an independent monitor for the police department.The Minneapolis City Council and Mayor Jacob Frey approved the terms of a court-enforceable consent decree in early January, which had to be approved by a federal judge before taking effect. The city has begun implementing the reforms laid out in the agreement and said it will continue to do so despite the Trump administration\\'s decision to dismiss the consent decree case.\"We\\'re doing it anyway,\" Frey said in a statement. \"We will implement every reform outlined in the consent decree—because accountability isn\\'t optional. Our independent monitor has lauded the meaningful progress we\\'ve made under the state settlement agreement, and the public can count on clear, measurable proof that our reforms are moving forward.\"\\nAs for the Louisville Police Department, the Justice Department\\'s investigation found that it, too, likely engaged in a pattern of conduct that violated citizens\\' civil and constitutional rights. The Justice Department, city of Louisville and its police department reached an agreement in principle toward a consent decree.Four Louisville Metro Police Department officers faced federal charges in connection with Taylor\\'s death in March 2020. Taylor, a 26-year-old EMT, was shot when officers stormed into her apartment while she was asleep with her boyfriend. Her boyfriend, who thought the officers were intruders, fired a handgun as they entered. The officers in response fired 22 shots into the apartment, and one struck Taylor in the chest.But in announcing the decision to dismiss the lawsuits against the Minneapolis and Louisville police departments, the Justice Department under President Trump claimed they accused the agencies of engaging in patterns of unconstitutional policing by \"wrongly equating statistical disparities with intentional discrimination and heavily relying on flawed methodologies and incomplete data.\"The Trump administration also said the consent decrees went too far and would have subjected the police departments to sweeping oversight.\"In short, these sweeping consent decrees would have imposed years of micromanagement of local police departments by federal courts and expensive independent monitors, and potentially hundreds of millions of dollars of compliance costs, without a legally or factually adequate basis for doing so,\" the Justice Department said.\\nDhillon said the agreements cost an average of $10 million a year and \"should be a rare exception and not the norm.\" She said \"specifics of policing, policy, hiring, training, management, promotion and internal policies are best made at a local level, where there\\'s local accountability, and local control over funding and policy issues.\"Both Minneapolis and Louisville either already have consent decrees at the state level or are hiring their own monitors and taking actions on their own to ensure constitutional policing, Dhillon said, adding that the cities should save money thanks to the Justice Department\\'s decision.\"You can actually use that money, tens of millions of dollars, to hire more cops for your communities that will keep you safer than a partner at a big law firm in D.C. getting paid to monitor you,\" Dhillon said.\\nIn:\\nMinneapolis Police Department\\nUnited States Department of Justice\\nLouisville Metro Police Department\\nTrump Administration\\nMelissa Quinn\\nMelissa Quinn is a politics reporter for CBSNews.com.

But they refused to publicly say where the men were being taken. Lawyers said the plane had been headed to strife-torn South Sudan. U.S. District Judge Brian E. Murphy in Massachusetts said that migrants from Myanmar, Vietnam, Cuba, South Sudan and Mexico did not have a “meaningful opportunity to object to transfer” to the African nation, where only one had connections, in defiance of a court order last month. The judge said he would determine later what, if any, the punishment might be for the administration. The decision came during a hearing to consider an emergency motion filed by attorneys after they learned their clients, two Asian immigrants detained in Texas, along with the others, had been sent to South Sudan, which is engulfed in armed ethnic and political conflict and a refugee crisis that has displaced over 4 million people.Lawyers for the U.S. government said detainees had enough time to raise fears of harm, if sent to a third country, with immigration officials at the detention center. And the men needed only 24 hours’ notice before being removed. But Murphy balked at that. The time between when the men were told they would be deported Monday evening to when the plane took off was about 17 hours, the judge surmised — “obviously insufficient.” More to Read He said the actions were “unquestionably violative of this court’s order.” Murphy issued an order later that evening directing the government to provide the detainees three days notice ahead of an interview where there is a reasonable fear for their safety in a “third country.” He also required officials provide access to lawyers, a telephone, an interpreter and a way to receive documents.Jacqueline Brown, an attorney representing a detainee from Myanmar, said she had no chance to speak with her client before he was removed.“The reason for notice is to afford due process,” she said. “He was unable to present his fear of being subjected to torture in South Sudan. He didn’t even have an interpreter when he was given the notice.” The removal order was in English, a language he didn’t speak well.The men were still sitting in a plane on Wednesday morning, Pacific time, according to government officials who briefed the court. Tom Cartwright, who tracks Immigration and Customs Enforcement flights, posted on X that a plane appearing to be the one carrying the eight deportees had landed in Djibouti, which is about 900 miles from Juba, the capital of South Sudan. Murphy, a Biden appointee, asked the government whether it was feasible to conduct interviews with the men in custody to determine whether they had credible fear claims, as required by the court order. The administration has been doubling down on efforts to remove immigrants, with little due process, to countries where they have no ties, defying court orders and testing the limits of executive power. During a news conference Wednesday, Department of Homeland Security officials said South Sudan was not the “final destination” for the eight immigrants removed from the U.S. a day earlier, despite attorneys’ declarations and a “Removal Order” naming the country as the end point. The officials said the immigrants had criminal records, were a public safety threat and would not be accepted by their home countries.“Because of safety and operational security, we cannot tell you what the final destination for these individuals will be,” said Tricia McLaughlin, assistant public affairs secretary.On Tuesday, Murphy ordered the Trump administration to maintain custody of the immigrants.“While the Court leaves the practicalities of compliance to Defendants’ discretion,” Murphy wrote, referring to the Department of Homeland Security, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and U.S. Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi, “the Court expects that class members will be treated humanely.”McLaughlin said the immigrants remain in Homeland Security custody. She said the agency is following due process laws, adding that the detainees and their lawyers were given “plenty of prior notice.” According to documents provided to reporters by the Department of Homeland Security, the detainees included one citizen of South Sudan and seven others from the other four countries. They were convicted of crimes including murder, attempted murder, robbery, lascivious acts with a child under age 12, and sexual assault involving a victim who was mentally and physically incapable of resisting, according to the federal officials.Though the news conference was titled “DHS Press Conference on Migrant Flight to South Sudan,” McLaughlin said the State Department brokered an agreement with “a nation” willing to accept the detainees. The officials emphasized that the detainees’ countries of origin had refused to take them back. “As a career law enforcement officer and a career officer with ICE, I’ve been dealing with these recalcitrant countries for years,” said acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons. “Having to see repeated murderers, sex offenders, violent criminals re-released back into the United States because their home countries would not take them back.”Asked whether South Sudan is considered a safe third country, Lyons deferred to the State Department, which did not immediately respond to an emailed list of questions. A travel advisory issued by the department warns U.S. travelers to not visit. “Armed conflict between various political and ethnic groups continues throughout the country,” it says, noting that kidnapping, road ambushes, armed robbery, murder and home invasion “are pervasive.”This month, a group of immigrants held in Texas, possibly including some of the same detainees, were told they were being deported to Libya and brought to a plane, before Judge Murphy ordered the government to cancel the flight. That politically unstable country in North Africa is beset by “terrorism, unexploded landmines, civil unrest, kidnapping, and armed conflict,” according to the State Department. Human rights groups have documented inhumane conditions at detention facilities and migrant camps, including torture, forced labor and rape.According to lawyers who filed the emergency motion, their clients, one from Myanmar and the other from Vietnam, were given notice on Monday by officers at the Port Isabel Detention Center in Los Fresnos, Texas, that they would be removed to South Africa. The men refused to sign the order, according to court records. The officers quickly rescinded, only to come back with another order saying they would be removed to South Sudan. Again, the men didn’t sign. The next morning, their lawyers and family members couldn’t locate them, according to court documents.The Myanmar man, who spoke the regional language of Karen, had final orders to be removed from Nebraska, home to about 8,000 refugees from Myanmar, which is ruled by a military dictatorship. Many of the refugees are from the Karen ethnic minority who escaped the long-running civil war.His attorney identified him as N.M. in court documents. Federal officials identified one of the Myanmar detainees as Nyo Myint and said he had been convicted of “first-degree sexual assault involving a victim mentally and physically incapable of resisting.”The Vietnamese man had signed orders to be deported back to his homeland, not a third country, according to an email from his spouse to an attorney that was included in the court file. Federal officials identified one of the detainees as Vietnamese: Tuan Thanh Phan, “convicted of first-degree murder and second-degree assault.”“Please help!” the spouse said in the email. “They cannot be allowed to do this, this is not the first and won’t be the last if they keep getting away with this. I am begging for your assistance.”“The detention centers are overcrowded with inhumane conditions and ICE is sending people anywhere they can to combat overcrowding. This is not right.”\\n```\\n\\n## [Judge rules White House violated order by deporting migrants to South Sudan](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/21/trump-deportations-south-sudan) (#37127)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 17:40:33+00:00\\n\\n```\\nA federal judge has ruled the US government’s attempt to deport migrants to South Sudan “unquestionably” violated an earlier court order.Brian E Murphy, the US district judge in Massachusetts, made the remark at an emergency hearing he had ordered in Boston following the Trump administration’s apparent removal of eight people to South Sudan, despite most of them being from other countries.On Tuesday, Murphy ruled that the Trump administration could not let a group of migrants being transported to countries that were not their own leave the custody of US immigration authorities.Lawyers for seven men – including Burmese, Laotian, Mexican and Cuban nationals – deported on Tuesday were told that their clients were given little more than 24 hours notice that they were being expelled from the US. Murphy, the judge, said that little amount of time was “plainly insufficient”.An eighth man in the group was a citizen of South Sudan, according to the Department of Homeland Security.Jonathan Ryan, a lawyer for Burmese man known in court documents as NM, who was expelled, said he initially received notice that his client was being sent to Libya, before being informed that client was actually being sent to South Africa. About two hours after the second notice, Ryan was told his client was being sent to South Sudan.“I’ve never in 20 years seen anything close to this happening,” said Ryan, who has been representing clients detained in Pearsall, Texas, since 2005.Furthering the confusion, a lawyer for the Department of Justice first indicated that the Burmese deportee would ultimately be sent to Myanmar, but the government has not provided details about the final destination of the flight.Murphy ordered the administration to clarify the facts of NM’s removal, including the moment that officials first decided it would be impractical or impossible to remove him to Burma, and the time and reasoning behind the reversal of that decision and determination that NM should be sent to Burma after all.Ryan said his client was part of an ethnic minority in Myanmar, and faced immense risks if he were to be sent there. “Whether he’s sent to Burma or South Sudan, he is at risk of harm – of abuse, exploitation, death,” Ryan said.“In fact, this is a death penalty case with traffic court-level procedure,” said Ryan. “Or rather, this procedure wouldn’t even fly in a traffic court.”Burma is in the midst of a civil war, and recently experienced its worst earthquake disaster in more than a century. Meanwhile South Sudan, the world’s youngest country, has widely been described as being on the verge of descending into another episode of civil war.Flight trackers and a report from the New York Times suggest that the flight carrying deportees in question may have stopped in Djibouti, not South Sudan.“This is so opaque and obscure,” Ryan said, “I have no clarity.”In an earlier briefing on Wednesday, a homeland security spokesperson acknowledged the deportation was occurring, but refused to say whether the final destination was South Sudan.“We conducted a deportation flight from Texas to remove some of the most barbaric, violent individuals illegally in the United States. These are the monsters that the district judge is trying to protect,” the spokeswoman, Tricia McLaughlin, said.McLaughlin went on to add: “It is absolutely absurd for a district judge to try to dictate the foreign policy and national security of the United States.”skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotion“Because of safety and operational security, we cannot tell you what the final destination for these individuals will be,” she continued.Federal immigration officials said the people were originally from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, Vietnam and South Sudan, but that their home countries refused to accept them as deportations. Homeland security officials claimed that they had been convicted of murder, armed robbery and other serious crimes.Last month, Murphy had issued an injunction that required any people being removed to a third country to receive due process. After reports of the apparent South Sudan flight, the judge told Elianis Perez, a justice department lawyer: “I have a strong indication that my preliminary injunction order has been violated.”In an email to his lawyer, the spouse of a Vietnamese man believed to have been sent to South Sudan wrote: “Please help! … They cannot be allowed to do this.”South Sudan’s police spokesperson, Maj Gen James Enoka, told the Associated Press on Wednesday that no migrants had arrived.Enoka said that if they did, they would be investigated and those found not to be from the country would be “re-deported to their correct country”.Immigration lawyers have accused the Trump administration of violating Murphy’s order several times in the past month, including in the case of a planned flight of Laotian, Vietnamese and Filipino immigrants to Libya and the expulsion of a Guatemalan man to Mexico.During Wednesday’s hearing, Murphy also chastised government lawyers for their handling of the case of the Guatemalan man, known as OCG. Lawyers initially said in a sworn declaration that OCG had been informed he was being sent to Mexico and confirmed that he was not afraid to go there, but the justice department later said the declaration was erroneous, and it could not confirm that OCG had been informed he was being sent to Mexico.“This is a really big deal,” Murphy said. “It’s a big deal to lie to a court under oath.”Following the hearing, Murphy issued a clarification to his prior preliminary injunction in which he said any removals of immigrants to third countries should be preceded by a formal notice, and individuals much have at least 10 days to evaluate and contest the removal.\\n```\\n\\n## [Trump admin’s South Sudan deportation bid violates court order, US judge says](https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3311288/trump-admins-south-sudan-deportation-bid-violates-court-order-us-judge-says) (#37631)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 19:35:19+00:00\\n\\n```\\nAn attempt by US President Donald Trump’s administration to transfer migrants to South Sudan violated a judicial order not to send deportees to countries other than their own without opportunity to contest their removal, a US judge said on Wednesday.Boston-based US District Judge Brian Murphy made the finding during a hearing one day after he issued an order that the administration not let a group of migrants being flown to South Sudan to leave the custody of US immigration authorities.Murphy said he would leave the question of any criminal penalties for Department of Homeland Security officials who violated his order to another day.At the outset of the hearing, US Justice Department lawyer Elainis Perez confirmed that the plane carrying the deportees had landed but did not say where, citing “very serious operational and safety concerns”.Perez also disputed Murphy’s finding that the migrants were not given the chance to challenge their deportations.Earlier on Wednesday, Homeland Security officials said at a press conference that the eight men being deported are from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, Vietnam and South Sudan, and were convicted of murder, armed robbery and other serious crimes.\\n```\\n\\n## [Justice Department moves to free Louisville, Minneapolis police from BLM-related monitoring](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/may/21/justice-department-moves-free-louisville-minneapolis-police-blm/) (#41054)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 14:11:42+00:00\\n\\n```\\nThe Department of Justice said Wednesday it will move to release Minneapolis and Louisville, Kentucky, from Black Lives Matter-inspired federal monitoring of their police departments, saying the previous administration wrongly pursued the cases.\\nGovernment lawyers will be in court this week to ask judges to cancel pending “consent decrees” that would have imposed the monitoring.\\nThe Biden administration had struck the agreements in December and January, moving to beat the transition to the Trump administration. Then-Attorney General Merrick Garland said the deaths of Black residents at the hands of police had to be rectified.\\nBut Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said the actual investigations the department used to justify heavy-handed federal monitoring were “flawed to the extent that we don’t have confidence in these factual findings.” She said her lawyers couldn’t stand up in court and advocate for them anymore.\\n“In these cases, we believe that when we’re accusing law enforcement we have to have a sound factual predicate for that. We don’t believe that existed,” said Ms. Dhillon, who leads the department’s Civil Rights Division.\\nThe Justice Department will also end what it called pre-consent decree investigations into six other jurisdictions: Phoenix, Arizona; Trenton, New Jersey; Memphis, Tennessee; Mount Vernon, New York; Oklahoma City; and the Louisiana State Police.\\nThe moves mark a major reversal in focus for the Justice Department. Ms. Dhillon’s predecessor at the civil rights division, Kristen Clarke, whom the Trump team said was an “avowed defund the police supporter.”\\nMs. Clarke and Mr. Garland had cited the deaths of Black residents George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Louisville as reasons why those cities needed federal monitoring of their police practices. They said they found excessive use of force, unlawful search warrant practices, poor treatment of disabled residents and discrimination against Black people.\\nMs. Dhillon said her division reviewed those findings and found they couldn’t stand up in court.\\nShe said in some cases her predecessors cherry-picked statistics and in other cases ignored obvious explanations for racial difference in enforcement.\\nIn Memphis, for example, she said the previous administration’s investigation suggested that police were racially discriminating in encounters with the homeless. But Ms. Dhillon said the city is majority-Black, the police department is majority-Black, and 75% of the city’s homeless population is Black.\\nShe said it was a “real stretch” to conclude racism in the encounters.\\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey complained that the dismissals came in the same week as the five-year mark of Floyd’s death, whom city police killed.\\n“What this shows is that all Donald Trump really cares about is political theater,” he said.\\nHe said the city is going to carry out the reforms called for in the decree anyway.\\n“We’re going to move forward with that work, with or without the White House,” the mayor said.\\nThe American Civil Liberties Union denounced the rollback, saying the Trump administration was abandoning federal oversight of police abuse.\\n“The DOJ under Biden found police were wantonly assaulting people and that it wasn’t a problem of ‘bad apples’ but of avoidable, department-wide failures,” said Jenn Rolnick Borchetta, the ACLU’s deputy project director on policing.\\nConsent decrees are binding agreements that jurisdictions enter into, usually under threat of even more severe federal action.\\nIn this case they would have installed monitors to scrutinize and report back on progress, and violations.\\nMs. Dhillon said consent decrees have proved to be problematic, and often seem to lead to more crime, and can last for years — all costing the local taxpayers, who have to fund the changes required, as well as the monitoring.\\n“It is a very serious matter to put an American city under a consent decree that increases crime, increases cost, decreases safety and in some cases makes it virtually impossible to comply or get out from under it,” Ms. Dhillon said.\\nShe said the department isn’t giving a pass to bad actors. She pointed to ongoing federal prosecutions of police officers accused of obtaining the warrant that led to the no-knock search that killed Taylor in Louisville.\\nShe also said they aren’t ruling out the use of consent decrees in the future, but said they must meet a higher standard than the Biden team was using.\\nAnd Ms. Dhillon said Minneapolis, for example, is still bound by a state-level consent decree.\\nThat’s something the ACLU acknowledged.\\n“While the ACLU of Minnesota is deeply disappointed in the DOJ’s decision to back out of this consent decree five years after the murder of George Floyd, this decision does not mean that the Minneapolis Police Department will be free to violate the rights of Minnesotans with impunity” said Deepinder Mayell, executive director of the state branch.\\nJason Johnson, president of the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund, hailed the dismissals Wednesday.\\n“We are gratified that the highest levels of DOJ leadership has recognized the dangers of broad, sweeping, and expensive federal oversight of local law enforcement,” he said.\\nHe said reforms should be more narrowly tailored than the sweeping monitoring the Biden team had sought.\\n“This move will, without doubt, enhance public safety and help restore order in cities across America,” Mr. Johnson said.\\nMs. Dhillon said career lawyers at the Justice Department had tried to get then-Attorney General William Barr to initiate investigations into Minneapolis and Louisville under the first Trump administration but he declined.\\nThose lawyers sought — and won — a different answer from Mr. Garland, Mr. Biden’s attorney general, sparking the investigations and eventual consent decrees.\\nNow the department has re-reversed and is asking the court to dismiss the Minneapolis and Louisville cases with prejudice. The department is also closing its own cases and retracting the Biden administration’s official findings.\\n```\\n\\n## [It’s the El Salvador Deportation Flight All Over Again—but This Time to South Sudan](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/05/donald-trump-immigration-deportations-south-sudan-flight-judge.html?via=rss) (#41149)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 20:07:50+00:00\\n\\n```\\nJurisprudence\\nMay 21, 20254:07 PM\\nDetainees board an ICE-chartered plane (not the one featured in this article) on April 15.\\nDavid Ryder/Getty Images\\nSign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\\nDonald Trump won the presidency in part on promises to deport immigrants who have criminal records and lack permanent legal status. But his earliest executive orders—trying to undo birthright citizenship, suspending critical refugee programs—made clear he wants to attack immigrants with permanent legal status too. In our series Who Gets to Be American This Week?, we’ll track the Trump administration’s attempts to exclude an ever-growing number of people from the American experiment.\\nFor months, President Donald Trump and his administration have been stress-testing our legal system, taking seemingly unconstitutional actions right and left—and judges have blocked many of them by issuing nationwide injunctions. But last week, the Supreme Court weighed a move that would make it easier for Trump to do whatever he wants: restricting or abolishing lower courts’ ability to issue injunctions that apply nationally. And this week, the justices lifted an injunction that was preventing federal authorities from revoking the legal status of hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants, essentially putting a bright red target on their backs for deportation.\\nMeanwhile, the administration reportedly carried out another lawless deportation flight—but this time, a small group of migrants was flown to South Sudan, a country on the brink of civil war that is experiencing a dire humanitarian crisis. A judge declared that those actions violated his order, which had banned deportations to third countries and required the federal government to adhere to due process laws.\\nHere’s the immigration news we’re keeping an eye on this week:\\nThe Trump Administration Sent Migrants to South Sudan, in Apparent Defiance of a Judge’s Orders\\nRoughly two weeks after U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy, of Massachusetts, issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Trump administration from deporting immigrants to third countries—countries that are not a foreign national’s place of origin—the president did it anyway. During a hearing on Wednesday, Murphy concluded, “The government’s actions in this case are unquestionably violative of this court’s order.”\\nThat hearing was the culmination of a chaotic 24 hours. Starting on Tuesday morning, at least two men, one from Myanmar and the other from Vietnam, were deported to South Sudan, having received notice from the government only one day beforehand, according to court documents. Their lawyers say they were not given a chance to raise credible-fear claims, and one man was given a removal notice in English, despite having limited proficiency in the language.\\nThere also appeared to be confusion about where the men would be deported. “I fear that my husband and his group, which consist of people from Laos, Thailand, Pakistan, Korea and Mexico are being sent to South Africa or Sudan against their will,” wrote the wife of the man from Vietnam, in an email to her attorney.\\nThis action flies in the face of Murphy’s April injunction, which specifically banned the federal government from deporting migrants to any country besides their home country without due process. Just two weeks ago, the judge issued another warning to the Trump administration not to attempt to deport any migrants to third countries without first giving written notice “in a language the non-citizen can understand as well as a meaningful opportunity for the non-citizen to raise fear-based claims for protection.”\\nUpon learning about the new deportations to South Sudan, Murphy held an emergency hearing Tuesday evening at which he pressed government lawyers for information on where the migrants were being taken. “Where is the plane?” he asked.\\n“I’m told that that information is classified, and I am told that the final destination is also classified,” said Elianis N. Perez, a lawyer for the Department of Justice, according to the New York Times. Perez insisted that the government had not violated Murphy’s orders because the man deported did not raise a credible-fear claim.\\nThe judge instructed Perez to tell everyone involved in the deportation operation, from the pilot to Department of Homeland Security officials, that they could face criminal contempt charges if his orders were violated. Then, during Wednesday’s hearing, Murphy ordered government attorneys to submit a declaration by the end of the day clarifying whether South Sudan’s government would be willing to send back U.S. deportees if they expressed credible-fear claims.\\nThe Supreme Court Gave the All Clear to Deport Venezuelans\\nOn Monday morning, the Supreme Court quietly made a hugely consequential immigration decision via its shadow docket. With the click of a button, it effectively pushed 350,000 lawful Venezuelan immigrants into undocumented legal status when it published a brief order that allows DHS to revoke their protected status, effective immediately.\\n“It’s a deeply upsetting decision because, as far as I can tell, this judicial action strips the most noncitizens of their immigration status in modern U.S. history,” Elora Mukherjee, a clinical law professor at Columbia University and director of the school’s Immigrants’ Rights Clinic, told me. “For the Supreme Court to do it with no reasoning at all, without oral argument or full briefing, it is shocking.”\\nThe justices were responding to an emergency appeal request by the Trump administration in a legal battle over Temporary Protected Status, a program that admits foreign nationals of countries that the federal government designates as unsafe due to ongoing armed conflict, environmental disasters, epidemics, or other extraordinary conditions. Those who qualify receive a work permit and are given protection from deportation—but soon after taking office, Trump signed an executive order directing DHS Secretary Kristi Noem to “terminate all categorical parole programs,” including TPS.\\nThis case was considered under the Supreme Court’s shadow docket—a process, usually reserved for extreme emergencies, in which no briefings or hearings are held. Ketanji Brown Jackson was the only justice who indicated she would deny the application to take the Trump administration’s case on this issue. In a dissent from a different shadow docket order this past week, Jackson laid out her objections: “As a practical matter,” she wrote, “it is plainly prudent to reserve our emergency docket for applicants who demonstrate that they truly need our help now.”\\nAfter Noem announced in January that DHS would begin revoking TPS for hundreds of thousands of immigrants, advocacy group National TPS Alliance immediately filed suit. U.S. District Judge Edward Chen, of California, ordered Noem to halt the revocation plan, holding that it was motivated by “unconstitutional animus.” The Trump administration promptly asked SCOTUS to intervene. Though the justices allowed Noem to move forward with terminating TPS for Venezuelans, they offered no explanation for their decision, leaving the lower courts without guidance as the case continues.\\nIn a Surprise Decision, the Supreme Court Says the Trump Administration Violated the Constitution With El Salvador Deportation Flights\\nOn Friday evening, the high court published a decision that extends an injunction blocking the president from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport immigrants, a decisive blow to a key component of his mass-deportation agenda.\\nThe Alien Enemies Act of 1798 is a wartime law that the president invoked back in March as the basis for summary deportations without due process. He used the act to justify deporting Venezuelan migrants to a mega-prison in El Salvador, accusing them of being gang members without providing any evidence.\\xa0On March 15, over 200 men were deported under the law, in violation of U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg’s order. In April, the Supreme Court overturned Boasberg’s order, holding that the migrants had sued in the wrong court. But SCOTUS also unanimously affirmed that migrants must be given due process before they are expelled under the Alien Enemies Act.\\nIn the wake of that decision, a group of Venezuelan men in immigration custody and at risk of immediate deportation sued the Trump administration to prevent their removal under the act. They took their request up to SCOTUS, which responded with a short order, released at 1 a.m., instructing the government to halt the planned deportations. Last Friday, the justices followed up with a full decision in which they affirmed that under the Fifth Amendment, immigrants are entitled to due process in removal proceedings and “must have sufficient time and information to reasonably be able to contact counsel, file a petition, and pursue appropriate relief.”\\nUp to this point, the government had been giving migrants 24 hours’ notice ahead of their deportation to El Salvador. These eleventh-hour notices, the court noted, were “devoid of information about how to exercise due process rights to contest that removal,” and therefore failed to comply with the Fifth Amendment. The majority left it to the lower courts to determine exactly what process must be given to migrants but made it clear that the government’s current practices fall far short of constitutional standards. It declined to answer the broader question of whether the Alien Enemies Act can even be used to deport alleged members of a gang, though Justice Brett Kavanaugh urged the court to answer that question soon.\\nTrump Starts Billing Immigrants Who Lack Permanent Legal Status\\nThe Trump administration has begun fining immigrants who lack permanent legal status for remaining in the country after receiving a removal order, a tactic it used during the president’s first term in office. So far, more than 4,000 people have received notices for these financial penalties, which total over $500 million, according to Reuters.\\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act does grant Immigration and Customs Enforcement the authority to impose fines on immigrants who ignore removal orders, but the penalty cannot exceed $500 a day. One of Trump’s executive orders also instructed DHS to collect “all fines and penalties” from those who lack permanent legal status, but in March the agency claimed that it would charge “$998 per day if you received a final order of removal and stayed.”\\nAccording to immigration attorneys who spoke to Reuters, the federal government has rarely invoked the power to fine immigrants, with a New York–based immigration lawyer remarking that one of his clients, who has lived in the U.S. for 25 years, has received a $1.8 million fine. “At first you look at something like this and think it’s fake,” he said. “I’ve never seen a client receive anything like this.”\\nAn immigrant named Maria, who lives in Florida, also received a $1.8 million fine, telling CBS News, “Ever since that day I live with anxiety. … I can’t sleep. … I don’t feel.” She added, “I don’t want to go back.” She said she has lived in the U.S. for two decades and has three children who are all U.S. citizens. Her attorney plans to appeal the fine.\\nGet the best of news and politics\\nSign up for Slate\\'s evening newsletter.\\nImmigration\\nSupreme Court\\nWho Gets to Be American This Week?\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

He argued that pragmatic foreign policy means that the US human rights agenda is “different in certain parts of the world” than in others.Lifting sanctions would allow foreign aid into Syria, potentially stabilizing the economy and encouraging millions of displaced Syrians to return, Rubio said. The White House, however, remains uncertain whether its approach will succeed.”If we engage [the al-Sharaa government], it may work out, it may not work out,” Rubio stated. “If we did not engage them, it was guaranteed to not work out.”US sanctions had aimed to stymie Assad’s efforts to rebuild the country after he regained control of most of Syria by 2015. Persistent issues had eroded the morale of the Syrian military, which largely refused to defend Damascus when HTS launched its offensive last November.Al-Sharaa has pledged to uphold Syria’s ethnic and religious diversity as he courts Western backing. However, his rule has been marked by reported massacres of Alawites, Christians, and Assad supporters.Israel has carried out multiple airstrikes in Syria in recent months, claiming the attacks were intended to defend Druze militias from fighters aligned with the new government.\\n```\\n\\n## [In Syria, a Shiite shrine and community navigate a changed landscape](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/syria-shiite-shrine-community-navigate-changed-landscape-122024316) (#34901)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 12:46:28+00:00\\n\\n```\\nSAYYIDA ZEINAB, Syria -- At the Sayyida Zeinab shrine, rituals of faith unfold: worshippers kneel in prayer, visitors raise their palms skyward or fervently murmur invocations as they press their faces against an ornate structure enclosing where they believe the granddaughter of Prophet Muhammad is entombed.But it’s more than just religious devotion that the golden-domed shrine became known for during Syria’s prolonged civil war.At the time, the shrine\\'s protection from Sunni extremists became a rallying cry for some Shiite fighters and Iran-backed groups from beyond Syria’s borders who backed the former government of Bashar Assad. The shrine and the surrounding area, which bears the same name, has emerged as one symbol of how the religious and political increasingly intertwined during the conflict.With such a legacy, local Shiite community leaders and members are now navigating a dramatically altered political landscape around Sayyida Zeinab and beyond, after Assad’s December ouster by armed insurgents led by the Sunni Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The complex transition that is underway has left some in Syria’s small Shiite minority feeling vulnerable.“For Shiites around the world, there’s huge sensitivity surrounding the Sayyida Zeinab Shrine,” said Hussein al-Khatib. “It carries a lot of symbolism.”After Assad’s ouster, al-Khatib joined other Syrian Shiite community members to protect the shrine from the inside. The new security forces guard it from the outside.“We don’t want any sedition among Muslims,” he said. “This is the most important message, especially in this period that Syria is going through.”Zeinab is a daughter of the first Shiite imam, Ali, cousin and son-in-law of Prophet Muhammad; she\\'s especially revered among Shiites as a symbol of steadfastness, patience and courage. She has several titles, such as the “mother of misfortunes” for enduring tragedies, including the 7th-century killing of her brother, Hussein. His death exacerbated the schism between Islam’s two main sects, Sunni and Shiite, and is mourned annually by Shiites. Zeinab\\'s burial place is disputed; some Muslims believe it’s elsewhere. The Syria shrine has drawn pilgrims, including from Iran, Iraq and Lebanon. Since Assad’s ouster, however, fewer foreign visitors have come, an economic blow to those catering to them in the area.Over the years, the Sayyida Zeinab area has suffered deadly attacks by militants.In January, state media reported that intelligence officials in Syria’s post-Assad government thwarted a plan by the Islamic State group to set off a bomb at the shrine. The announcement appeared to be an attempt by Syria’s new leaders to reassure religious minorities, including those seen as having supported Assad’s former government.Al-Khatib, who moved his family from Aleppo province to the Sayyida Zeinab area shortly before Assad’s fall, said Assad had branded himself as a protector of minorities. “When killings, mobilization ... and sectarian polarization began,\" the narrative \"of the regime and its allies was that ‘you, as a Shiite, you as a minority member, will be killed if I fall.’”The involvement of Sunni jihadis and some hardline foreign Shiite fighters fanned sectarian flames, he said.The Syria conflict began as one of several uprisings against Arab dictators before Assad brutally crushed what started as largely peaceful protests and a civil war erupted. It became increasingly fought along sectarian lines, drew in foreign fighters and became a proxy battlefield for regional and international powers on different sides.Recently, a red flag reading “Oh, Zeinab\" that had fluttered from its dome was removed after some disparaged it as a sectarian symbol.Sheikh Adham al-Khatib, a representative of followers of the Twelver branch of Shiism in Syria, said such flags “are not directed against anyone,” but that it was agreed to remove it for now to keep the peace.“We don’t want a clash to happen. We see that ... there’s sectarian incitement, here and there,\" he said. Earlier, Shiite leaders had wrangled with some endowments ministry officials over whether the running of the shrine would stay with the Shiite endowment trustee as it’s been, he said, adding “we\\'ve rejected\" changing the status quo. No response was received before publication to questions sent to a Ministry of Endowments media official. Adham al-Khatib and other Shiite leaders recently met with Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa. “We’ve talked transparently about some of the transgressions,” he said. “He promised that such matters would be handled but that they require some patience because of the negative feelings that many harbor for Shiites as a result of the war.”Many, the sheikh said, “are holding the Shiites responsible for prolonging the regime’s life.” This “is blamed on Iran, on Hezbollah and on Shiites domestically,\" he said, adding that he believes the conflict was political rather than religious. Early in the conflict, he said, “our internal Shiite decision was to be neutral for long months.” But, he said, there was sectarian incitement against Shiites by some and argued that “when weapons, kidnappings and killing of civilians started, Shiites were forced to defend themselves.” Regionally, Assad was backed by Iran and the Shiite militant Lebanese group Hezbollah, whose intervention helped prop up his rule. Most rebels against him were Sunni, as were their patrons in the region. Besides the shrine\\'s protection argument, geopolitical interests and alliances were at play as Syria was a key part of Iran’s network of deterrence against Israel.Today, rumors and some social media posts can threaten to inflame emotions.Shrine director Jaaffar Kassem said he received a false video purporting to show the shrine on fire and was flooded with calls about it.At the shrine, Zaher Hamza said he prays “for safety and security” and the rebuilding of “a modern Syria, where there’s harmony among all and there are no grudges or injustice.”Is he worried about the shrine? “We’re the ones who are in the protection of Sayyida Zeinab — not the ones who will protect the Sayyida Zeinab,\" he replied.While some Shiites have fled Syria after Assad’s fall, Hamza said he wouldn’t.“Syria is my country,” he said. “If I went to Lebanon, Iraq or to European countries, I’d be displaced. I’ll die in my country.”Some are less at ease.Small groups of women gathered recently at the Sayyida Zeinab courtyard, chatting among themselves in what appeared to be a quiet atmosphere. Among them was Kamla Mohamed.Early in the war, Mohamed said, her son was kidnapped more than a decade ago by anti-government rebels for serving in the military. The last time she saw him, she added, was on a video where he appeared with a bruised face.When Assad fell, Mohamed feared for her family. Those fears were fueled by the later eruption of violence in Syria’s coastal region, where a counteroffensive killed many Alawite civilians — members of the minority sect from which Assad hails and drew support as he ruled over a Sunni majority. Human rights groups reported revenge killings against Alawites; the new authorities said they were investigating.“We were scared that people would come to us and kill us,” Mohamed said, clutching a prayer bead. “Our life has become full of fear.”Another Syrian Shiite shrine visitor said she\\'s been feeling on edge. She spoke on condition she only be identified as Umm Ahmed, or mother of Ahmed, as is traditional, for fear of reprisals against her or her family.She said, speaking shortly after the coastal violence in March, that she’s thought of leaving the country, but added that there isn’t enough money and she worries that her home would be stolen if she did. Still, “one’s life is the most precious,” she said. She hopes it won’t come to that.“Our hope in God is big,” she said. “God is the one protecting this area, protecting the shrine and protecting us.”___Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

For China, a key player in the region’s economic and strategic landscape, the implications are impossible to ignore.Trump’s extraordinary reception in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates underscores a stark reality: Gulf leaders, who dealt with former US president Joe Biden’s relatively arms-length approach, likely view Trump’s transnationalism as a safer bet.The multitrillion-dollar deals signed during his visit – spanning artificial intelligence, technology and finance – signal more than just lucrative contracts for American firms. They mark a deliberate pivot by Gulf states to deepen ties with a potentially resurgent US economy.This realignment carries risks for Beijing. China has spent years cultivating the Gulf as a critical partner for energy imports, infrastructure projects and its Belt and Road Initiative. Yet Trump’s laser focus on redirecting Gulf capital into US markets, bolstered by dozens of corporate leaders, threatens to squeeze China’s access to the petrodollar pipeline that Beijing hopes will help fuel its economic revival.Trump’s most audacious move, however, came not only for Riyadh, Abu Dhabi and Doha but Damascus. The lifting of sanctions on Syria, advocated by its recent regional allies Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey, signals a strategic realignment.People celebrate in Homs, Syria, after US President Donald Trump announced plans during his visit to Saudi Arabia to ease sanctions on Syria and normalise relations with its new government, on May 13.

Security Council.But Pedersen said the Syrian people are cautiously optimistic that President Donald Trump’s announcement last week that the U.S. will lift sanctions and a similar EU announcement Tuesday will “give them a better chance than before to succeed against great odds.”Speaking by video from Damascus, Pedersen called sanctions relief, including by the United Kingdom last month, as well as financial and energy support from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey “historic developments.”“They hold major potential to improve living conditions across the country and to support the Syrian political transition,” the U.N. special envoy said. “And they give the Syrian people a chance to grapple with the legacy of misrule, conflict, abuses and poverty from which they are trying to emerge.”Former Syrian President Bashar Assad was ousted in a lightning rebel offensive late last year after a 13-year war, ending more than 50 years of rule by the Assad family. The new Syrian government, led by Ahmad al-Sharaa, has said Syria’s heritage of coexistence must be preserved at all costs, but the country faces massive challenges.Today, 90% of Syrians live in poverty, with 16.5 million needing protection and humanitarian assistance, including nearly 3 million facing acute food insecurity, Ramesh Rajasingham, the U.N. humanitarian division’s chief coordinator, told the council.U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday that Syria is potentially “on the verge of collapse,” warning that would lead to civil war and the country again becoming “a playground” for the Islamic State group and other militants.Pedersen told the Security Council that IS has been escalating attacks in areas of Syria in recent weeks, with signs of more coordinated operations using improvised explosive devices and medium-range weapons.Rubio said there’s no guarantee that “things are going to work out” by lifting sanctions and working with al-Sharaa’s transitional government, but if the U.S. didn’t try, “it’s guaranteed not to work out.” He said Trump’s announcement of sanctions relief has led regional and Arab partner nations to help stabilize the country.“No one should pretend this is going to be easy, because it’s not,\" Rubio said. But if Syria could be stabilized, it would mean broader stability in the region, including Lebanon, Jordan and Israel, he said.“It is a historic opportunity we hope comes to fruition,\" Rubio said. \"We’re going to do everything we can to make it succeed.”John Kelley, political coordinator at the U.S. mission to the United Nations, told the council that “U.S. government agencies are now working to execute the president’s direction on Syria’s sanctions.”“We look forward to issuing the necessary authorizations that will be critical to bringing new investment into Syria to help rebuild Syria’s economy and put the country on a path to a bright, prosperous and stable future,” he said. “The United States also has taken the first steps toward restoring normal diplomatic relations with Syria.”Syria’s transitional government is urged to take “bold steps” toward Trump administration expectations, Kelley said, including making peace with Israel, quickly removing foreign militant fighters from the Syrian military, ensuring foreign extremists such as Palestinian militias can’t operate from Syria, and cooperating in preventing the resurgence of the Islamic State group.Syria’s deputy U.N. ambassador, Riyad Khaddour, praised Trump’s “courageous decision” to lift sanctions as well as his meeting with al-Sharaa. Khaddour also touted actions by the European Union, U.K., Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates “to support Syria as it moves forward with confidence and hope.”“The new Syria” is seeking to become “a state of peace and partnership, not a battleground for conflicts or a platform for foreign ambitions,” he said.\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

We know he died, he had an accident.\\' She added, breaking down into tears: “There\\'s things that we want to question. We want these people to be sat in front of us. Something went wrong that day, he didn\\'t come back. There\\'s questions we need to ask - please.”Jay Slater with his mother Debbie DuncanES CompositeJay\\'s father Warren Slater, 58 had earlier told the court: \"The two people who can put some light on whatever happened to Jay aren\\'t in court today.\"The coroner agreed to pause proceedings so she could compose herself. He later adjourned it altogether so his staff could make further efforts to find Mr Qassim and Mr Roccas, but warned the family he was “not confident of success”.The inquest had earlier heard Jay was found to have drugs and alcohol in his system before he died from a head injury.Two friends he was on holiday with in Tenerife before he vanished also “can\\'t be located”, the inquest heard on Wednesday.Lucy Law – who received a final call last June from the British tourist saying he had a cut leg was lost, had one per cent charge on his phone and needed water – is among those who could not be traced to give evidence, the coroner revealed at the start of his inquest.Jay made a heartbreaking final call to friend Lucy saying he had cut his leg, was lost, dehydrated and had just one per cent battery on his phone after he left the Airbnb.Brad Hargreaves, who apprentice bricklayer Slater had also been on holiday with, can also not be traced, the inquest was told.As proceedings began at Preston Coroner\\'s Court, Dr Adeley said police had failed in attempts to contact Ms Law and several of Mr Slater\\'s other British friends.“We can\\'t find them, they have stopped responding to phone calls,” he said while Mr Slater\\'s parents Debbie, 55, and father, listened in silence.Dr Adeley also said: “When drugs are involved in a death, the witnesses are less than forthcoming and do not wish to speak to the authorities.”Rescue workers during the search for Mr Slater (James Manning/PA)PA WireJay’s mobile last pinged in the mountainous Rural de Teno Park after Jay walked the wrong way from the Airbnb.A post-mortem examination concluded he died of traumatic head injuries, consistent with a fall from height.The inquest also heard his severe skull and pelvis fractures were consistent with a fall from a height - and that traces of cocaine, ecstasy and ketamine were in his body.Toxicology expert Dr Stephanie Martin told the hearing there were difficulties checking for the presence of drugs or alcohol in a body so severely decomposed.But she said analysis of Mr Slater\\'s body showed traces of the presence of MDMA and MDA, commonly known as ecstasy, along with cocaine and alcohol.Dr Martin said because of the limitations of the analysis, she could not say exactly how much or how soon before death the drugs had been taken.Analysis of samples by the Spanish authorities also showed the presence of ketamine which was not found in the UK samples.He found no sign of injuries associated with Mr Slater being assaulted prior to his death – but said his post mortem examination could not rule out the possibility that Jay had been pushed.Dr Richard Shepherd said the injuries seen in assault victims were \\'very different from the type of injuries I saw with Jay\".The pathologist said decomposition of Mr Slater\\'s body during the 28 days it lay at the bottom of the ravine in the hot Tenerife climate meant he could not \"exclude\" the possibility of a push \"because a push would not leave a mark\".\"But with that proviso there was nothing to indicate an assault or gripping of any sort,\" he added.The witness was then asked about what effect the skull injuries would have.Dr Shepherd said: \"It would have had an immediate and devastating effect on Jay\\'s consciousness.\"The injuries were so severe I have no doubt he would have been instantly unconscious from the moment of that blow to the head.The coffin of Jay Slater being carried into Accrington Cemetery Chapel (Acacia Redding/PA)PA Wire\"Death could well have been instant the injury was so severe. Jay would undoubtedly be unconscious and unaware.\"It\\'s most likely death would have occurred instantly or extremely soon afterwards.\"Dr Shephard said he gave the official cause of death as a head injury.A preliminary Spanish post-mortem examination report recorded the death as \"violent\", with the immediate cause being \"traumatic shock\" and a severe traumatic brain injury.Dr Shepherd said the findings were consistent with his own findings.Statements were read from Spanish locals Ramon Hernandez and Juan Diaz, who were working near the holiday let Mr Slater had stayed at.Both statements said at around 7.45am on the day Mr Slater disappeared, an \"English-speaking guy\" carrying a half-litre bottle of Coca-Cola, approached them and asked what time the local bus arrived.The man, later identified as Mr Slater, was told a bus came around 10am.He also asked about taxis but was told no local taxi service was available and the Spanish men then continued working and did not see where Mr Slater went.The inquest has been adjourned.

A win in the Basque country could be a defining moment for both managers in their tenures at their respective clubs, with both marooned deep in the bottom half of the Premier League table - United in 16th, Spurs in 17th. Now, going into the high-stakes affair on Wednesday, Spurs could have a slight psychological advantage over their counterparts, and it all comes down to kit. Spurs are technically the ‘home’ team for the final, and as such, have priority when it comes to sporting their traditional home kit. In Europe, Tottenham’s kit differs slightly to the one they wear domestically. In the top flight and domestic cup competitions, they wear navy shorts to complement their white shirts, but, owing to a tradition dating back to 1961, they wear white shorts when they play on the continent.Black out: Bruno Fernandes and Joshua ZirkzeeAction Images via ReutersThat is where the kit clash with United comes in, as the Red Devils wear white shorts with their red shirts. On Wednesday, the shirts are not the clashing issue, but the shorts, forcing Amorim’s men to play with black shorts and socks to go with their red shirts. Between the sticks, Guglielmo Vicario will wear yellow for Spurs, while Andre Onana will don a green jersey. Spurs’ tradition of playing in all white dates back to when Bill Nicholson was in charge at White Hart Lane all those years ago, and the Spurs legend, capped just once for England in his playing career, had led the Lilywhites to their first European qualification in 1961, having completed the league and cup double. Nicholson claimed that an all white strip would be more visible on poorly-lit pitches, and Spurs have worn all white in Europe ever since.\\n```\\n\\n## [Which Manchester United players will get a Europa League winners\\' medal amid Marcus Rashford decision](https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/man-utd-europa-league-winners-medal-rashford-b1228636.html) (#31377)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 13:14:46+00:00\\n\\n```\\nManchester United tonight have one final chance to end the season with some silverware and secure a return to the Champions League.It has been a miserable campaign for the club, first under Erik ten Hag and now Ruben Amorim, and they 16th in the Premier League table with just one match to play.However, nobody at United will be thinking about that fixture against Aston Villa this weekend, with the focus instead firmly on the Europa League final against Tottenham on Wednesday night in Bilbao.Amorim’s side produced a miraculous comeback to get past Lyon in the quarter-finals and then proved too strong for Athletic Bilbao in the last-four, booking their place in the European final.The winner of the match will earn a spot in next season’s Champions League, which would be a major boost to the club as they look to strengthen this summer.Ruben Amorim’s side attempt to end a miserable season on a highGetty ImagesWho will get a Europa League medal?Should United beat Spurs and lift the trophy, there will be no big parade through Manchester, with it already decided that celebrations will be limited to a barbecue at the Carrington training ground.The players and staff will, of course, have a medal to remember the occasion, and it is up to the club to decide who to give those to.UEFA rules state: “The winning team is presented with 50 gold medals and the runner-up with 50 silver medals.”This is different to the Premier League, for example, where 40 medals are given to the champions and only players who have made at least five appearances can get one.In the Europa League, there is no such limit and players do not even need to be in the current squad. How the 50 medals are split is a decision for the club, but it can be assumed that all those in the matchday squad for the final will receive one.It is possible that even players not currently at United could still be handed one for their contributions earlier in the season.Marcus Rashford made six appearances in the competition for United before Christmas, scoring and assisting in the draw with Porto.He has spent the second-half of the season on loan at Aston Villa, but could potentially still be given a medal if United do win the final.The same goes for Antony, who has shone at Real Betis in recent months and will play for the Spanish club in the Conference League final against Chelsea next week.\\n```\\n\\n## [Will Tottenham or Manchester United qualify directly for the Champions League?](https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/will-tottenham-man-utd-champions-league-qualify-b1228671.html) (#31379)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 13:14:44+00:00\\n\\n```\\nWith Spurs sitting 17th in the Premier League table and United only one place above, it has been a dreadful season for both clubs, and yet there is one final chance for them to end it on a high.A European trophy and Champions League qualification is on the line in Bilbao amid suggestions neither club deserve a seat at Europe’s top table for what they have produced for the majority of the campaign.Spurs, though, were impressive in coming through their semi-final tie against Bodo/Glimt and can deliver on Ange Postecoglou’s statement earlier in the season that he always wins a trophy in his second year at a club.Ruben Amorim has cut a more downbeat figure when discussing his side’s struggles, stating ahead of the semi-final win over Athletic Bilbao that “nothing is going to save our season”.Will Tottenham or Man United have to qualify for Champions League?The winner of the final will become the latest Premier League side to book their place in next season’s Champions League.Liverpool and Arsenal have already done so after wrapping up a top-five finish, and they will be joined by three of Newcastle, Chelsea, Aston Villa, Manchester City and Nottingham Forest.There will therefore be six Premier League clubs in the competition next season, as a result of the rule that the Europa League winners earn a place in the top tier of European competition.Tottenham or Man United will not have to go through Champions League qualifying either, earning an automatic place in the league phase of the competition.\\n```\\n\\n## [Europa League final prize money: How much will Tottenham and Manchester United earn?](https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/europa-league-final-prize-money-tottenham-man-utd-today-b1228634.html) (#31382)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 13:14:40+00:00\\n\\n```\\nWednesday night’s showcase fixture in Bilbao pits together familiar domestic rivals whose form on the continent has belied their ongoing struggles at home.Both Spurs and United have endured truly torrid Premier League campaigns, suffering their 21st and 18th defeats of the season respectively on Friday night, against Aston Villa and Chelsea, to leave them sitting 17th and 16th with just one match left to play this term.But remarkably they still have a chance to make this most woeful of seasons a memorable one as they go head to head at the Estadio de San Mames in the Basque Country, with Tottenham having easily seen off Norwegian champions Bodo/Glimt 5-1 on aggregate in the semi-finals after squeezing past Eintracht Frankfurt and also beating AZ Alkmaar after finishing fourth in the inaugural league phase of Europe’s secondary club competition.United, meanwhile, emphatically denied Athletic Club a fairytale home final appearance in Bilbao after stunning Lyon in an all-time classic tie in the last eight having thrashed Real Sociedad and ended the league phase in third.These two totally out-of-form teams have just two wins from their last 18 league games combined, but for one a major trophy still beckons, as does a coveted place in next season’s Champions League proper.For Spurs, it would be a first trophy of any sort since the 2008 League Cup under Juande Ramos and first in Europe for 41 years since the 1983/84 Uefa Cup, while United won the FA Cup last season under Erik ten Hag. They last lifted European silverware with the 2016/17 Europa League under Jose Mourinho, beating Ajax in the final in Stockholm.The omens are good for Tottenham, who have not lost any of their last six games against United across all competitions and have beaten them three times already this season, twice in the Premier League without conceding - 3-0 and 1-0 - as well as coming out on top in a seven-goal thriller in the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup in December.Europa League final prize money: How much will Tottenham and Manchester United earn?Though both clubs will still earn plenty this season, finishing so low in the Premier League will be an obvious hit to revenue streams.They will hope to make up some of that shortfall in the Europa League, where there is an overall prize pot of €565million (£475.4m) to be shared across every club competing.€25m (£21m) of that goes to the winners, with €18.5m (£15.5m) reserved for the runners-up.\\n```\\n\\n## [Jay Slater inquest is HALTED as his sobbing mother pleads for \\'answers\\' over his death - and coroner...](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14735887/Jay-Slater-inquest-halted-mother-pleads-answers.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490) (#32541)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 15:20:10+00:00\\n\\n```\\nJay Slater inquest is HALTED as his sobbing mother pleads for \\'answers\\' over his death - and coroner launches bid to bring last people to see him alive to court\\n16:10, 21 May 2025, updated\\n16:59, 21 May 2025\\nBy\\nJAMES TOZER\\nand\\nMARK DUELL\\nThe inquest into the death of Jay Slater was halted today when his mother Debbie hit out after two British men who rented an Airbnb he went back to failed to attend.The 19-year-old, from Oswaldtwistle in Lancashire, disappeared in Tenerife last summer sparking a major manhunt before he was found dead about a month later.Mr Slater was on holiday on the island and had been to the NRG music festival with friends at the Papagayo nightclub in Playa de las Americas on June 16 last year.Early the next day, Mr Slater is thought to have gone to an Airbnb with other people he had met while on holiday, then vanished and was reported missing on June 18.His body was found in a steep and inaccessible area by a mountain rescue team from the Spanish Civil Guard near the village of Masca on July 15, 2024 – and an inquest at Preston Coroner\\'s Court today heard he was found to have had drugs in his system.The hearing was also told extensive efforts including summonses had been issued for several witnesses who were in contact with Mr Slater before he disappeared.But Mr Slater\\'s mother Debbie Duncan, 55, today made an emotional outburst after the two British men who rented the AirBnb - convicted drug dealer Ayub Qassim, 31, and Steven Roccas, previously known as \\'Rocky\\'– did not attend the hearing.She told Lancashire senior coroner Dr James Adeley: \\'How can we ever get any understanding?

Timeline: The search for missing teenager Jay Slater in Tenerife Here are the key events leading up to the discovery of Jay Slater\\'s body after the British teenager vanished in Tenerife in June 2024:– Sunday June 16Mr Slater attends the NRG music festival with friends at Papagayo nightclub in the tourist resort of Playa de las Americas in the south of Tenerife.– Monday June 17In the early hours of Monday he goes to stay in an apartment in the north of the island with people he had met over the course of the night.– 7.30amMr Slater posts a picture on Snapchat from the doorway of the property he stayed at overnight, tagged as being in Rural de Teno park.– 8.30am\\xa0He calls his friend, Lucy Law, telling her he had attempted to walk back to his accommodation after missing his bus – a journey that would take more than 10 hours. In the frantic last phone call, Mr Slater says he had \\'cut his leg\\' on a cactus and had \\'no idea where he was\\'.Ms Law says her friend told her he was \\'lost in the mountains, he wasn\\'t aware of his surroundings, he desperately needed a drink and his phone was on 1%\\'. Mr Slater\\'s phone runs out of battery shortly after with his last known location being in Rural de Teno park.– 9.04amHe is reported missing.– Tuesday June 18After friends spend the previous day searching to no avail, local police and mountain rescue teams scour Rural de Teno park for Mr Slater. His family fly out to Tenerife to join the search.– Wednesday June 19The search is temporarily moved to the Los Cristianos area in the south of the island because of a potential lead, but this is quickly discounted and the search returns north. Mr Slater\\'s mother, Debbie Duncan, says she feared her son had \\'been taken against his will\\'.– Thursday June 20The search returns to Rural de Teno park, around the village of Masca. Emergency workers meet in various locations throughout the day, combing bushes, overgrown terrain, hillsides and rivers, but fail to find the missing teenager.– Friday June 21Spanish police reject an offer of support from Lancashire Constabulary as the hunt continues. Police, firefighters and search and rescue personnel comb a vast area of land in and around the village of Masca.Search and rescue personnel carefully look through dead palm trees covering a river at the bottom of the hillside near to an Airbnb property Mr Slater had reportedly been driven to. The owner of the property tells reporters she saw Mr Slater walk up the road past her property but did not see him again after that – describing the situation as worrying.– Saturday June 22Mr Slater\\'s mother issues a direct plea to her missing son on the sixth day of the hunt, saying: \\'We just need you home.\\'\\xa0Firefighters appear to conduct the majority of the searches as they wear helmets to tackle dangerous hillside terrain in Tenerife. The search parties seem noticeably smaller compared with other days – with only a handful of emergency workers visible in the village of Masca and the surrounding areas.– Sunday June 23Search teams narrow their efforts on small buildings close to where Mr Slater\\'s phone last pinged. Officers from the Guardia Civil in the Canary Island can be seen circling two structures at the bottom of a ravine in Rural de Teno Park. Efforts appear to be solely focused on the one area after days of searches in the village of Masca and the surrounding landscape.– Thursday June 27Mr Slater\\'s mother says she will use donations from the GoFundMe appeal set up by Ms Law, to fund her stay on Tenerife. Ms Duncan says the £36,000 raised by more than 3,200 individual donations will be used to support mountain rescue teams, and to cover her own accommodation and food costs during her extended stay on the island.– Friday June 28The Guardia Civil appeal for volunteer associations, such as firefighters, and individual volunteers who are experts in rugged terrain to assist in a \\'busqueda masiva\\', or massive search, to take place on Saturday.– Saturday June 29A renewed search for Mr Slater gets under way in the village of Masca, near to his last-known location, co-ordinated to take in a steep rocky area, including ravines, trails and paths.– Sunday June 30Spanish police call off the search for the missing teenager. A Guardia Civil spokesperson reportedly says: \\'The search operation has now finished, although the case remains open.\\'\\xa0It is understood that Mr Slater\\'s family and friends will stay in Tenerife to continue to look for him.– Tuesday July 2Ms Duncan says \\'words cannot describe the pain and agony we are experiencing\\' after searches fail to trace her missing son. In a statement issued through the British overseas missing persons charity LBT Global, she says the land search for her son has been called off, but thanks the Guardia Civil who she says \\'worked tirelessly up in the mountains where Jay\\'s last phone call was traced\\'.– Wednesday July 3In a statement on the GoFundMe appeal Get Jay Slater Home, which had raised almost £50,000 as of this date, Ms Duncan thanks the \\'vast\\' generosity of donors, saying her family are \\'grateful for all of your support and kindness during this unimaginable time\\'. She writes that part of the funds will be used to support volunteers hunting for Mr Slater in the mountains near to where his last phone call was traced.– Sunday July 14The missing teenager\\'s mother speaks of her \\'heartache\\' and criticises \\'awful comments and conspiracy theories\\' as it approaches a month since Mr Slater disappeared. In a statement released through LBT Global, Ms Duncan says: \\'As we approach four weeks of our beautiful Jay\\'s disappearance, we cannot put into words the heartache we are suffering as a family.\\'Ms Duncan says the family wish to thank the public for \\'their continued support and well wishes\\' and praises the British Embassy and police for \\'doing all they can to support us\\'. But she also criticises \\'awful comments and conspiracy theories\\' posted on social media, which she brands \\'vile\\' and says were \\'hindering\\' people trying to help locate the teenager.– Monday July 15A body is found in the search for Mr Slater. Charity LBT Global says that, while formal identification has not yet taken place, the remains were found with the 19-year-old\\'s clothes and possessions near his last known location.Members of a mountain rescue team from the Spanish Civil Guard discovered the body near the village of Masca. The force says Mr Slater could have fallen in the steep and inaccessible area where the body was discovered. Dr Adeley told Mr Slater\\'s family: \\'You\\'ve heard of our difficulties in finding Ayub Qassim and Steven Roccas. However in view of your distress we will make an effort to find them.\\'The coroner said those of Mr Slater\\'s friends who are currently abroad would also be provided with new summonses to attend the resumed hearing.He asked the family to pass his office any contact details which they had for them – and the hearing would reconvene at a date to be fixed.Earlier, the inquest was told Mr Slater had traces of cocaine, ecstasy and ketamine in his body when he was found dead - and had been \\'off his head on drugs\\'.The hearing was also told that his friends had failed to attend to give their accounts.Lucy Law – who received a call from the Mr Slater saying he was lost, had 1 per cent charge on his phone and needed water – is among those who could not be traced to give evidence, the coroner revealed.As proceedings began, Dr Adeley said police had failed in attempts to contact Ms Law and several of Mr Slater\\'s other British friends.\\'We can\\'t find them, they have stopped responding to phone calls,\\' he said while Mr Slater\\'s parents Ms Duncan and father Warren Slater, 58, listened in silence.Dr Adeley also told the coroner\\'s court: \\'When drugs are involved in a death, the witnesses are less than forthcoming and do not wish to speak to the authorities.\\'The inquest also heard his severe skull and pelvis fractures were consistent with a fall from a height - and that traces of cocaine, ecstasy and ketamine were in his body.And a friend said that Mr Slater seemed to be \\'off his head on drugs\\' the night before his death.The apprentice bricklayer was last seen alive leaving the white-washed house in Masca at around 7.30am on June 17.He was apparently trying to walk the 10-hour journey back to the apartment where he was staying after missing a bus back.An immediate focus of the investigation was a post Mr Slater uploaded on Snapchat of him having a cigarette, with the location tagged at the door of the apartment at 7.30am UK time.Then two phone calls emerged.Ms Law - who later attended Mr Slater\\'s funeral in August - received a call at 8.30am where he said he was lost, had 1 per cent charge on his phone and needed water.In a video call to their other friend, Brad Hargreaves, Mr Slater was walking on rough, stony ground, saying he was making the long walk back.His mother and father joined family and friends to comb the island for sightings.As the mystery surrounding the teen\\'s disappearance grew, \\'vile\\' and \\'distressing\\' conspiracy theories began to emerge that dogged efforts to find Mr Slater.Among the rumours circulating included claims Mr Slater had been targeted by a criminal cartel on the island for allegedly stealing a watch from a gang member - something his family vehemently denied happened.Tragically Mr Slater\\'s body was found a month later in a mountainous area of the island.He is believed to have lost his footing and fallen while desperately trying to climb through the ravine to try and return to his hotel.A post-mortem found that he died of traumatic head injuries, consistent with a fall from height. His death would have been instantaneous.A forensic pathologist who examined Mr Slater\\'s body after its repatriation to the UK said at today\\'s inquest that injuries including severe skull and pelvis fractures were consistent from a fall from a height.He found no sign of injuries associated with Mr Slater being assaulted prior to his death – but said his post mortem examination could not rule out the possibility that Jay had been pushed.Dr Richard Shepherd said the injuries seen in assault victims were \\'very different from the type of injuries I saw with Jay\\'.The pathologist said decomposition of Mr Slater\\'s body during the 28 days it lay at the bottom of the ravine in the hot Tenerife climate meant he could not \\'exclude\\' the possibility of a push \\'because a push would not leave a mark\\'.\\'But with that proviso there was nothing to indicate an assault or gripping of any sort,\\' he added.Dr Shepherd said the injuries caused by the fall would have caused \\'instantaneous\\' loss of consciousness and Mr Slater would have died soon afterwards.\\'Jay would undoubtedly have been unconscious and unaware,\\' he added.Even with immediate specialist treatment in a neurosurgical unit, Dr Shepherd said he would be \\'extremely surprised\\' if Mr Slater could have survived his \\'severe\\' injuries.The inquest also heard traces of cocaine, ecstasy and ketamine were found in Mr Slater\\'s body.Toxicologist Dr Stephanie Martin said the length of time before Mr Slater\\'s body was discovered meant it was impossible to carry out tests on blood or urine.But examination of a liver sample found metabolites of MDMA and of another recreational drug MDA, as well as of cocaine.Spanish scientists additionally tested hair and muscle samples, finding a metabolite of ketamine, Dr Martin added.However due to the length of time between Mr Slater\\'s death and the samples being taken, she was unable to say if he had been under the influence of drugs when he fell to his death, she said.But he would have taken the ketamine within the previous 12 hours, Dr Martin added.She said her analysis suggested Mr Slater had taken MDMA within one or two days before his death.But the Spanish tests indicated that Mr Slater had used ketamine \\'over a much longer period\\'.The hearing was also told by one friend of Mr Slater who did give evidence about a message in which the teenager mentioned being \\'thrown out\\' of the rave and trying to sell an expensive watch for £10,000.Joshua Forshaw – who gave evidence by videolink - said he met Mr Slater and his friends for the first time when they flew out for the NRG festival and swapped Snapchat details.He told the Spanish authorities that when he saw Mr Slater on June 16 – the night before his death – he seemed to be \\'off his head on drugs\\'.Asked how he seemed by Dr Adeley, Mr Forshaw said: \\'He was quite excitable. He seemed to be in a happy mood, joyful, excited to be there.\\'He assumed Mr Slater had taken ecstasy because his friend Mr Hargreaves had asked Mr Forshaw to split a tablet with him, he said.Later that night Mr Forshaw received a Snapchat message from Mr Slater saying he had \\'ended up getting thrown out\\' with two other people and planned to sell a watch for \\'ten quid\\'.Mr Forshaw said that meant £10,000 but said he never saw the watch and had no involvement in attempts to sell it.Snapchat messages normally delete automatically, but Mr Forshaw said he saved that one and later handed it to police.However the court was told police later accidentally deleted the image, the court heard.The Snapchat message read: \\'Yes cuz ended up getting thrown out of there me with 2 Maili kids just took an AP off some **** on way to sell it for 10 quid\\'.Mr Forshaw said an AP was an expensive watch brand. The message was sent at 5.58am. Jay Slater\\'s mother Debbie Duncan arrives at Preston Coroner\\'s Court in Lancashire today Lucy Law (above) is among those who could not be traced to give evidence, a coroner revealed Jay Slater pictured with friend Brad Hargreaves (left), with whom he was on holiday in Tenerife He said that later in the early morning of June 17, Mr Slater sent him another image with mountains in the background showing his top pulled up and two knives in his waistband.At the same time through Snapchat he said Mr Slater texted him: \\'I\\'m carrying these in case it kicks off.\\'Mr Forshaw said he didn\\'t save the image and did not mention it to the Spanish Guardia Civil before leaving Tenerife.However he told Lancashire Police about it when he returned to the UK because it was \\'the right thing to do\\'.Mr Forshaw said he did not ask Mr Slater if he was OK in response to the message.Later that morning he overheard a Facetime call between Mr Slater and his friend Mr Hargreaves after going to their apartment.\\'He was slurring his words but he wasn\\'t begging for help or anything,\\' he told the court. \\'He didn\\'t sound like he was in danger.\\' The Airbnb house in Masca, Tenerife, where Jay Slater was staying before his disappearance Mr Forshaw said Mr Hargreaves urged Mr Slater to get a taxi back to where they were staying, but the teenager said he had no money.Mr Hargreaves told Mr Slater he should either get a taxi and run off when it reached its destination, or alternatively they would pay for it, the hearing was told.Mr Slater didn\\'t sound \\'distressed or angry\\', he added.The coroner pressed Mr Forshaw on whether it was true that Mr Slater sent him an image showing knives in his waistband, reminding him that he was under oath.\\'I wouldn\\'t lie,\\' he said. \\'I went to police off my own back.\\'At the close of his evidence, Dr Adeley instructed him to provide \\'proof\\' that \\'ten quid\\' was \\'common parlance\\' meaning £10,000, warning that there would be \\'serious consequences\\' if he did not comply.Before closing the videolink, the coroner gave him until 2pm to supply the information. Attempts to contact the Britons with whom Jay spent his final hours via mobile phone numbers and email addresses which they gave the Spanish authorities were unsuccessful, the court heard.Police served summonses on Ayub Qassim, who was renting the AirBnB he went back to, and fellow Briton Steven Roccas, known as Rocky, the coroner heard.But both were unknown at the addresses in London held by police.Witness summons were also issued for Jay’s friends Josh Forshaw, Lucy Law, Brad Hargreaves and Brandon Hodgson.Mr Forshaw responded to a summons and gave evidence, but Mr Hargreaves replied to say he would be away on holiday when the inquest was heard today, having booked the trip last October.Ms Law is currently in Tenerife, the coroner was told, while Mr Hodgson is also understood to be abroad.\\'We\\'ve been looking for them for months and we cannot find them,\\' Dr Adeley said. \\'We really tried, we just can\\'t find them.\\'Asking about Mr Qassim and the fellow Briton whose AirBnb the teenager went back to, Mr Slater\\'s father Warren told the coroner: \\'The two people who can put some light on whatever happened to Jay aren\\'t in court today.\\'Dr Adeley said he understood his concerns.But he said evidence from Spanish witnesses given to the Tenerife authorities due to be spelt out to the hearing would corroborate the account Mr Qassim gave at the time.Also today, the inquest heard from two members of a Dutch search team which flew out to the island at the request of Mr Slater\\'s family.They said it would have taken Mr Slater about three-and-a-half hours to hike from the Airbnb in Masca to the ravine where his body was found.Poignantly they said that from having retraced his last steps, they could appreciate why he thought he could reach the sea. Jay Slater\\'s father Warren Slater (right) and brother Zak (left) at Preston Coroner\\'s Court today \\'I can imagine he thought he was going to make it,\\' said Signi Zoekhonden. \\'He\\'s a young guy.\\'She said it was only the last hour of the route where it became \\'difficult to walk\\', although there was a stream he could have drunk from.But in the last 50 metres before the ravine it became necessary to use ropes and climbing equipment to proceed safely.In addition, by 10.30am the temperature would have been rising sharply.Statements from three locals describing Mr Slater\\'s last known movements in the remote village were also read to the hearing.One, Luisa Hernandez, recalled Mr Slater asking her at about 7.55am when the next bus would be, to which she responded that it was due around 10am.Later that morning she was driving to an appointment and briefly caught sight of him walking \\'at a brisk pace\\' along the main road.This was the last time he was seen alive.Detective Chief Insp Rachel Higson, head of Lancashire Police\\'s digital media investigation unit, analysed Mr Slater\\'s iPhone after it was returned to his family. A police officer overlooks Masca in Tenerife during the search for Jay Slater on June 21, 2024 On June 16 it was unsuccessfully used to make payments to unknown recipients in the sums of €320 (£270) and €120 (£110).At 9.26pm there was a message from \\'Hodgey\\' to Mr Slater reading: \\'Get that 2 ton out for me aswell bro.\\'Later in the night there were \\'repeated efforts\\' by Ms Law – referred to on his phone as Lucy Mae – to contact Mr Slater, telling him he is \\'off your head\\' and to go back to their apartment.At around 2.40am on June 17 a message was sent by Hodgey reading: \\'You need to get home.\\'Mr Slater replied: \\'You think I\\'m going home you must be disabled.\\'Then shortly before 6am Mr Slater sent an image to a different Snapchat group captioned: \\'Just took a 12k rolly off some **** with this Maili kid off to get 10 quid for it now haha off my undies.\\'He also sent a two-second video of himself in the back of a moving car, consistent with driving to Masca.At 6.09am Mr Slater sent his friend Bradley his location as being in the village, followed by a seven second video an hour later showing a mountainous scene which police geolocated to Masca.At 8.13am Mr Slater sent a WhatsApp message which could not be recovered which gave his location 1.5km from the Airbnb, approximately a 26 minute walk. Jay Slater\\'s brother Zak Slater arrives at Preston Coroner\\'s Court in Lancashire this morning This was his last confirmed location, DCI Higson said.At 8.35am Ms Law sent him a message telling him to \\'get back to wherever the f*** you just came from\\' which was delivered and read.The last contact was a Snapchat call with a contact called \\'Luce\\' at 8.55am.Police analysed the phone\\'s battery health and established that at 8.27am that morning it was on 3 per cent, declining to 2 per cent by 8.33am and 1 per cent at 8.52am.The phone also showed strenuous activity including ascending \\'inclines\\' between 7.49am and 8.49am but nothing after that – consistent with the phone running out of charge.DCI Higson said the messages over the night fitted with Jay\\'s friends being \\'concerned about his state\\' due to his being \\'incapacitated\\'. Jay Slater attended the NRG music festival with two friends before his disappearance Analysis of the phone battery, location and activity data were \\'consistent\\' with what witnesses had said and where he was last seen, she added.\\'Having read all the messages there\\'s nothing at all to suggest Jay was frightened, that he was under any threat, that he was scared of anybody, that he was forced to do anything against his will.\\'The detective said there was no other reference from analysis of his phone to a stolen watch or Jay trying to sell it, or evidence that it ever existed.She confirmed that \\'AP\\' could refer to the high-end Audemars Piguet watch brand while \\'Rolly\\' was likely to mean a Rolex.DCI Higson told the coroner that \\'ten quid\\' was widely used in East Lancashire where Mr Slater lived to mean £10,000.Earlier witness Mr Forshaw told the coroner this was his understanding of the phrase \\'ten quid\\' but he had no way of knowing that this was what Mr Slater meant in his message.In August, hundreds gathered in Accrington to bid a final farewell at his funeral, as his coffin was laid to rest amid an encore of drum-and-bass music.During their eulogies, friends recalled Mr Slaters \\'buzzing and smiling\\' demeanour and told their late schoolmate to \\'keep partying hard up there\\'.His parents led the procession of mourners through the drizzle on August 10 to the service at the packed Accrington Crematorium Chapel, while many more watched on an outdoor screen. The coffin of Jay Slater ahead of his funeral in Accrington, Lancashire, on August 10, 2024, where mourners wore the colour blue in his memory On November 21, a GoFundMe page titled Get Jay Slater Home was closed after it had received £72,821 worth of donations.In a final post on the page, Mr Slater\\'s family said they had been able to give a \\'truly deserved… send-off\\' at his funeral.They also explained how the donations were spent, which included hiring a search team from the Dutch non-profit organisation Signi Zoekhonden and paying for their stay in Tenerife while they searched for the teenager\\'s body.The same coroner also presided over the inquest into the death of mother-of-two Nicola Bulley, who went missing while walking her dog after dropping her children off at school in in St Michael\\'s-on-Wyre, Lancashire, in January 2023.Her disappearance also provoked a storm of attention on social media with TikTok sleuths sharing outlandish theories.The 45-year-old\\'s body was found in the River Wyre three weeks later after a huge search effort which sparked global headlines.Dr James Adeley, senior coroner for Lancashire, later ruled that Ms Bulley\\'s death was accidental and that she did not have \\'any desire\\' to take her own life. That hearing took place amid tight security at County Hall in Preston, with members of the public who attended subjected to searches and warned against disrupting proceedings.By contrast, Mr Slater\\'s inquest is being held at Preston Coroner\\'s Court.\\n```\\n\\n## [Furious Spaniards beat British \\'animals\\' off their houses amid Europa League chaos as Man Utd and...](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-14734927/Man-United-Tottenham-fans-fury-Bilbao-Europa-League-final.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490) (#32544)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 15:12:41+00:00\\n\\n```\\n14:42, 21 May 2025, updated 20:43, 21 May 2025 By VIVEK CHAUDHARY Tottenham and Man United meet in the Europa League final on Wednesday nightAround 80,000 fans have reportedly flown out to Spain ahead of the matchTottenham vs Man United LIVE: Brits take over Bilbao as both sides look to end a season of doom and gloom\\xa0Locals in Bilbao expressed fury and disgust as Tottenham and Manchester United fans unleashed an orgy of drunken, yobbish behaviour ahead of tonight’s Europa League final.An estimated 80,000 fans of both teams are descending on the city in what has been described as an ‘English invasion’, but locals of the Basque city were left gobsmacked at their inebriated state ahead of kick off that resulted in vandalism, minor scuffles and widespread anti-social behaviour.Thousands of Tottenham fans gathered along two major avenues in the centre of Bilbao bringing traffic to a halt as they drank beer and sang late into Tuesday night.Fans, many of them shirtless, climbed lampposts, destroyed traffic lights and vandalised other property as shocked residents looked on.Police eventually ordered bars in the area to close at around midnight, earlier than usual, by which time some Tottenham fans had been drinking for almost 12 hours buying beer that cost five Euros a glass-almost double the normal price.Izaro Laka, 65 who lives close to where they had gathered said: ‘I’ve never seen people so drunk and behaving so badly. The English are yobs and all they want to do when they come to Spain is drink and cause trouble. A resident protested against Man United fans putting up banners close to his apartment United fans have been boozing in Spain as kick off for the Europa League final draws closer One fan loses his balance and knocks over his drink during the build up to the big game Some locals were cordial with the British visitors, including these Athletic Club fans Locals in Bilbao expressed fury and disgust at\\xa0vandalism, minor scuffles and widespread anti-social behaviour ahead of the Europa League final between Tottenham and Man United Fans were pictured standing on traffic lights and climbing lamposts in the Spanish city Manuel, 80, claimed \\'it\\'s only the English that do this\\' and that \\'once they\\'ve had a drink they become hooligans\\' Local resident Daniel Leston, 78, said the \\'rowdy behaviour and fighting is totally unacceptable\\' ‘I’m used to seeing football fans coming to Bilbao from all over Spain and Europe because the ground is very close to me. But these English fans are like out-of-control animals.’Manchester United fans took over the Plaza Neuva, in the heart of Bilbao’s old town. The picturesque square is surrounded by stylish bars and eateries specialising in serving Pintxos, small snacks typical in Spain’s Basque region.With team colours hanging all around the square, fans let off red flares and clambered onto tables and chairs as they knocked back beer and sang, their voices echoing around the cobbled lanes of Bilbao’s historic quarter.One fan, clearly the worse for wear, attempted to climb up scaffolding to get on the balcony of an overlooking flat, leading to widespread cheers from his fellow supporters. The furious owner rushed into his property and emerged with a cane to stop him from getting any higher, leading to roars of ‘United.’As the evening wore on and the atmosphere became more boisterous, police were forced to intervene as scuffles broke out amongst the Manchester United fans.Odon Sanchez, a regular at the Sorginzulo bar in Plaza Nueva, which is considered one of the finest in the city told MailOnline: ‘We love our football in Bilbao, but the conduct of these people disgusts me. I don’t understand why they behave like this, they should be ashamed of themselves.‘This part of Bilbao is very beautiful and historic, tourists love coming here. But we don’t want people like this, our lives have been disrupted and I can’t wait for them to go home.’Bar worker Luka said: ‘I’ve been serving alcohol day. I didn’t know people could drink this much. The English have an endless appetite for beer.’ One fan had attempted to climb up scaffolding to get on the balcony of an overlooking flat Te furious owner rushed into his property and emerged with a cane to stop him Manchester United fans let off red flares as their gathered in the build-up to Wednesday\\'s final One local complained that English fans just want to drink having descended on the city A bar worker claimed they had been serving beer all day to supporters on the eve of the match Fans have reportedly been drinking beer costing double the normal price in Bilbao No major incidents or arrests, however, have been reported at locations where fans are staying\\nLocal resident Daniel Leston, 78 said: \\'I\\'m a big football fan but there\\'s no excuse for people behaving like this.\\'This rowdy behaviour and fighting is totally unacceptable. It is disgraceful. These so-called football fans should be ashamed of themselves. I just wish these people would go.\\'Manuel, 80 said: \\'I\\'m a big Real Madrid fan but I\\'ve never seen our supporters behave like this. It\\'s only the English that do this. They get very drunk, that\\'s the main problem. I\\'m sure a lot of them are very nice when they\\'re sober but once they\\'ve had a drink they become hooligans.\\'At both locations where Tottenham and Manchester United had gathered, local drug dealers weaved amongst them offering bags of cocaine for around 100 Euros.Around 50 miles away, there were further reports of mayhem caused by Tottenham and Manchester United fans who had spent the day drinking. Rival groups clashed in San Sebastian and Santander, where many supporters are staying because of excoriate hotel prices in Bilbao.Despite the widespread mayhem, no major incidents or arrests were reported at any of the locations where fans are staying.Many of those who spent the day in Bilbao bragged how they had drunk anything between 20 and 30 pints.Tottenham fan George Mitchell from Hertfordshire said: ‘We’ve been on it all day and it’s been great, but I hope that things don’t get out of control. So far, it’s just been a bit of fun and quite rowdy but that’s what you’d expect at a major football match. It’s what the English do.’ Man United and Tottenham fans have clashed in San Sebastian, located 48 miles from Bilbao Police have confirmed, however, that no arrests were made despite the incident Both teams have been allocated 15,000 tickets for the final at the San Mames Stadium An estimated 50,000 fans are expected to be in the city without tickets for the final The\\xa0centre of Bilbao has effectively been divided into two with one side for Tottenham fans and the other for Manchester United Giant screens have also been erected so that those without tickets can watch the game Man United fans have been based in\\xa0Plaza Nueva in the city in the build-up to the final Manchester United fan Jasbir Gill said: ‘There’s ten of us out here and we haven’t stopped drinking. I’m pretty sure that we’re going to carry on doing the same right up until the game starts.’Bilbao is mounting the biggest security operation in its history with an estimated 5,000 police and security personnel on duty for tonight’s game.Each of the Premier League clubs have been allocated 15,000 tickets each for the final but an estimated 50,000 fans, many of them expected to be supporters of Tottenham could be in the city without tickets, causing a major security headache for organisers.Police are putting in place three safety rings around the 53,000 capacity San Mames stadium to ensure ticketless fans cannot get close to it and all roads around it have been closed to traffic. Separate routes have also been created for Tottenham and Manchester United supporters accessing the ground.The centre of Bilbao has effectively been divided into two with one side for Tottenham fans and the other for Manchester United. Giant screens have also been erected so that those without tickets can watch the game.Bingen Zuperia, the security advisor for the Basque Government described the security operation as the largest ever not just in Bilbao but the entire Basque region and admitted that he was ‘nervous.’He said: ‘We are constantly reviewing the operation. I won’t hide the fact that I’m nervous; this job generates moments of anxiety. This will be the largest security deployment in the history of the Basque country.’In another headache for organisers, officials have been working around the clock to ensure the lights do not go out on the showpiece event.Bilbao was severely hit by the power outage which occurred in Spain and Portugal recently causing widespread chaos as daily life, transportation and industrial operations came to a grinding halt.

An official told MailOnline: ‘The eyes of the world will be on us, and Bilbao has never experienced a sporting event like this.

Fans have been forking out\\xa0€5 for beers ahead of the Europa League final in Bilbao Man United and Tottenham fans had been warned about potentially sky high prices Fans could purchase a 40cl beer for €5 (£4.20), while a ‘katxi’ – a one-litre beer was priced at €10 (£8.40) at one fan meeting point.Prices, however, had reportedly been doubled for the arrival of Man United and Tottenham fans.\\xa0Mixed drinks, including gin, rum or whisky, were priced at €9 (£7.60).Water had been priced €2 (£1.60), while non-alcoholic beer, coke and tonic would set fans back €3.50 (£2.90).\\xa0Fans were also required to buy reusable cups for €1 (0.80p), which were non-refundable.Supporters have been soaking up the atmosphere in the build-up to kick off, with fans largely separated into different parts of the city.An estimated 80,000 fans of both teams have reportedly descended on the city\\xa0 Manchester United fans took over the Plaza Neuva, in the heart of Bilbao’s old town.\\xa0 Fans have been forking out for alcoholic drinks in the build-up to the showpiece in the city Fans have been seen in good spirits as the hours count down to kick-off in Bilbao Tottenham and Man United fans have largely been separated in the Spanish city Manchester United fans took over the Plaza Neuva in the heart of Bilbao’s old town The picturesque square is surrounded by stylish bars and eateries specialising in serving Pintxos, small snacks typical in Spain’s Basque region.\\xa0Tottenham supporters congregated in Pozas, located close to the San Mames stadium, which will host the final.\\xa0Each of the Premier League clubs have been allocated 15,000 tickets each for the final but an estimated 50,000 fans, many of them expected to be supporters of Tottenham could be in the city without tickets, causing a major security headache for organisers.Police are putting in place three safety rings around the 53,000 capacity San Mames stadium to ensure ticketless fans cannot get close to it and all roads around it have been closed to traffic. Separate routes have also been created for Tottenham and Manchester United supporters accessing the ground.The centre of Bilbao has effectively been divided into two with one side for Tottenham fans and the other for Manchester United. Giant screens have also been erected so that those without tickets can watch the game.Bingen Zuperia, the security advisor for the Basque Government described the security operation as the largest ever not just in Bilbao but the entire Basque region and admitted that he was ‘nervous.’He said: ‘We are constantly reviewing the operation. I won’t hide the fact that I’m nervous; this job generates moments of anxiety. This will be the largest security deployment in the history of the Basque country.’Some locals have complained about the behaviour of English fans in the Spanish city, with one telling MailOnline that all they want to do when they come to \\'is drink and cause trouble.\\'Both Man United and Tottenham fans have travelled to Bilbao hoping their teams can rescue dismal seasons by securing European glory.The two clubs head into the final amid disastrous Premier League campaigns, which see them lie 16th and 17th in the table. Tottenham would end a 17-year trophy drought with victory.\\xa0Victory for either Ruben Amorim or Ange Postecoglou\\'s sides will come with the added incentive of qualification for next season\\'s Champions League, making the match reportedly worth around £100m.\\n```\\n\\n## [The drugs Jay Slater had in his system when he died are revealed at inquest as court is told he...](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14734667/Jay-Slater-inquest-coroner-Tenerife-missing.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490) (#32575)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 15:45:21+00:00\\n\\n```\\n10:57, 21 May 2025, updated 16:45, 21 May 2025 By JAMES TOZER and MARK DUELL Jay Slater had traces of cocaine, ecstasy and ketamine in his body when he was found dead in Tenerife after going missing - and had been \\'off his head on drugs\\', an inquest was told today.The hearing into the death of the British teenager, whose disappearance sparked a massive search in June last year, was also told that his friends had failed to attend to give their accounts.Lucy Law – who received a call from the 19-year-old tourist saying he was lost, had 1 per cent charge on his phone and needed water – is among those who could not be traced to give evidence, a coroner revealed today.As proceedings began, Lancashire senior coroner Dr James Adeley said police had failed in attempts to contact Ms Law and several of Mr Slater\\'s other British friends.\\'We can\\'t find them, they have stopped responding to phone calls,\\' he said while Mr Slater\\'s parents Debbie Duncan, 55, and father Warren Slater, 58, listened in silence.Dr Adeley also told Preston Coroner\\'s Court: \\'When drugs are involved in a death, the witnesses are less than forthcoming and do not wish to speak to the authorities.\\'The inquest also heard his severe skull and pelvis fractures were consistent with a fall from a height - and that traces of cocaine, ecstasy and ketamine were in his body. A friend also said that Mr Slater seemed to be \\'off his head on drugs\\' the night before.Mr Slater, from Oswaldtwistle in Lancashire, had attended the NRG Festival at Papagayo, in Playa de las Americas, Tenerife on June 16 last year.But after becoming separated from his friends following the all-night rave he went back to an AirBnB holiday cottage in the remote village of Masca with the two Britons, convicted drug dealer Ayub Qassim, 31, and another man.The apprentice bricklayer was last seen alive leaving the white-washed house at around 7.30am on June 17. Jay Slater called his friend Lucy Law (pictured together) in June last year saying he was lost Lucy Law (above) is among those who could not be traced to give evidence, a coroner revealed Members of Jay Slater\\'s family including his mother Debbie Duncan (front right) arrive at Preston Coroner\\'s Court in Lancashire today for the inquest into the death of the 19-year-old Jay Slater pictured with his friend Brad Hargreaves (left), with whom he was on holiday in Tenerife The Airbnb house in Masca, Tenerife, where Jay Slater was staying before his disappearance He was apparently trying to walk the 10-hour journey back to the apartment where he was staying after missing a bus back.An immediate focus of the investigation was a post Mr Slater uploaded on Snapchat of him having a cigarette, with the location tagged at the door of the apartment at 7.30am UK time.Timeline: The search for missing teenager Jay Slater in Tenerife Here are the key events leading up to the discovery of Jay Slater\\'s body after the British teenager vanished in Tenerife in June 2024:– Sunday June 16Mr Slater attends the NRG music festival with friends at Papagayo nightclub in Playa de las Americas.– Monday June 17In the early hours of Monday he goes to stay in an apartment in the north of the island with people he had met.– 7.30am\\xa0Mr Slater posts a picture on Snapchat from the doorway of the property he stayed at overnight, tagged as being in Rural de Teno park.– 8.30am\\xa0He calls his friend, Lucy Law, telling her he had attempted to walk back to his accommodation after missing his bus – a journey that would take more than 10 hours. She\\xa0says he told her he was \\'lost in the mountains, he wasn\\'t aware of his surroundings, he desperately needed a drink and his phone was on 1 per cent\\'. Mr Slater\\'s phone runs out of battery shortly after with his last known location being in Rural de Teno park.– 9.04amHe is reported missing.– Tuesday June 18After friends spend the previous day searching to no avail, local police and mountain rescue teams scour Rural de Teno park for Mr Slater. His family fly out to Tenerife to join the search.– Wednesday June 19The search is temporarily moved to the Los Cristianos area in the south of the island because of a potential lead, but this is quickly discounted and the search returns north. His mother Debbie Duncan says she feared her son had \\'been taken against his will\\'.– Thursday June 20The search returns to Rural de Teno park, around the village of Masca.– Friday June 21Spanish police reject an offer of support from Lancashire Constabulary as the hunt continues. Police, firefighters and search and rescue personnel comb a vast area of land in and around the village of Masca.– Saturday June 22Firefighters appear to conduct the majority of the searches as they wear helmets to tackle dangerous hillside terrain in Tenerife.– Sunday June 23Search teams narrow their efforts on small buildings close to where Mr Slater\\'s phone last pinged.\\xa0– Friday June 28The Guardia Civil appeal for volunteer associations, such as firefighters, and individual volunteers who are experts in rugged terrain to assist in a \\'busqueda masiva\\', or massive search, to take place on Saturday.– Saturday June 29A renewed search for Mr Slater gets under way in the village of Masca, near to his last-known location, co-ordinated to take in a steep rocky area, including ravines, trails and paths.– Sunday June 30Spanish police call off the search for the missing teenager.\\xa0Mr Slater\\'s family and friends stay in Tenerife to continue to look for him.– Monday July 15A body is found in the search for Mr Slater.\\xa0Members of a mountain rescue team from the Spanish Civil Guard discovered the body near\\xa0 Masca. Then two phone calls emerged.Ms Law - who later attended Mr Slater\\'s funeral in August - received a call at 8.30am where he said he was lost, had 1 per cent charge on his phone and needed water.In a video call to their other friend, Brad Hargreaves, Mr Slaterwas walking on rough, stony ground, saying he was making the long walk back.His mother and father joined family and friends to comb the island for sightings.As the mystery surrounding the teen\\'s disappearance grew, \\'vile\\' and \\'distressing\\' conspiracy theories began to emerge that dogged efforts to find Mr Slater.Among the rumours circulating included claims Mr Slater had been targeted by a criminal cartel on the island for allegedly stealing a watch from a gang member - something his family vehemently denied happened.Tragically Mr Slater\\'s body was found a month later in a mountainous area of the island.He is believed to have lost his footing and fallen while desperately trying to climb through the ravine to try and return to his hotel.A post-mortem found that he died of traumatic head injuries, consistent with a fall from height. His death would have been instantaneous.A forensic pathologist who examined Mr Slater\\'s body after its repatriation to the UK said at today\\'s inquest that injuries including severe skull and pelvis fractures were consistent from a fall from a height.He found no sign of injuries associated with Mr Slater being assaulted prior to his death – but said his post mortem examination could not rule out the possibility that Jay had been pushed.Dr Richard Shepherd said the injuries seen in assault victims were \\'very different from the type of injuries I saw with Jay\\'.The pathologist said decomposition of Mr Slater\\'s body during the 28 days it lay at the bottom of the ravine in the hot Tenerife climate meant he could not \\'exclude\\' the possibility of a push \\'because a push would not leave a mark\\'.\\'But with that proviso there was nothing to indicate an assault or gripping of any sort,\\' he added.Dr Shepherd said the injuries caused by the fall would have caused \\'instantaneous\\' loss of consciousness and Mr Slater would have died soon afterwards.\\'Jay would undoubtedly have been unconscious and unaware,\\' he added.Even with immediate specialist treatment in a neurosurgical unit, Dr Shepherd said he would be \\'extremely surprised\\' if Mr Slater could have survived his \\'severe\\' injuries.The inquest also heard traces of cocaine, ecstasy and ketamine were found in Mr Slater\\'s body.Toxicologist Dr Stephanie Martin said the length of time before Mr Slater\\'s body was discovered meant it was impossible to carry out tests on blood or urine.But examination of a liver sample found metabolites of MDMA and of another recreational drug MDA, as well as of cocaine.Spanish scientists additionally tested hair and muscle samples, finding a metabolite of ketamine, she added.However due to the length of time between Mr Slater\\'s death and the samples being taken she was unable to say if he had been under the influence of drugs when he fell to his death, she said.But he would have taken the ketamine within the previous 12 hours, she added.The hearing was also told by one friend of Mr Slater who did give evidence about a message in which the teenager mentioned being \\'thrown out\\' of the rave and trying to sell an expensive watch for £10,000.Joshua Forshaw – who gave evidence by videolink - said he met Mr Slater and his friends for the first time when they flew out for the NRG festival and swapped Snapchat details.He told the Spanish authorities that when he saw Mr Slater on June 16 – the night before his death – he seemed to be \\'off his head on drugs\\'.Asked how he seemed by Dr Adeley, Mr Forshaw said: \\'He was quite excitable. He seemed to be in a happy mood, joyful, excited to be there.\\' Apprentice bricklayer Jay Slater, 19, pictured with his mother Debbie Duncan (file picture) Jay Slater\\'s father Warren Slater (right) and brother Zak (left) at Preston Coroner\\'s Court today He assumed Mr Slater had taken ecstasy because his friend Mr Hargreaves had asked Mr Forshaw to split a tablet with him, he said.Later that night Mr Forshaw received a Snapchat message from Mr Slater saying he had \\'ended up getting thrown out\\' with two other people and planned to sell a watch for \\'ten quid\\'.Mr Forshaw said that meant £10,000 but said he never saw the watch and had no involvement in attempts to sell it.Snapchat messages normally delete automatically, but Mr Forshaw said he saved that one and later handed it to police.However the court was told police later accidentally deleted the image, the court heard.The Snapchat message\\xa0read: \\'Yes cuz ended up getting thrown out of there me with 2 Maili kids just took an AP off some **** on way to sell it for 10 quid\\'.\\xa0 Mr Slater went to an AirBnB cottage with drug dealer Ayub Qassim (pictured) and another man Mr Forshaw said an AP was an expensive watch brand.\\xa0The message was sent at 5.58am.He said that later in the early morning of June 17, Mr Slater sent him another image with mountains in the background showing his top pulled up and two knives in his waistband.At the same time through Snapchat he said Mr Slater texted him: \\'I\\'m carrying these in case it kicks off.\\'Mr Forshaw said he didn\\'t save the image and did not mention it to the Spanish Guardia Civil before leaving Tenerife.However he told Lancashire Police about it when he returned to the UK because it was \\'the right thing to do\\'.Mr Forshaw said he did not ask Mr Slater if he was OK in response to the message. A police officer overlooks Masca in Tenerife during the search for Jay Slater on June 21, 2024 Later that morning he overheard a Facetime call between Mr Slater and his friend Mr Hargreaves after going to their apartment.\\'He was slurring his words but he wasn\\'t begging for help or anything,\\' he told the court. \\'He didn\\'t sound like he was in danger.\\'Mr Forshaw said Mr Hargreaves urged Mr Slater to get a taxi back to where they were staying, but the teenager said he had no money.Mr Hargreaves told Mr Slater he should either get a taxi and run off when it reached its destination, or alternatively they would pay for it, the hearing was told.Mr Slater didn\\'t sound \\'distressed or angry\\', he added.The coroner pressed Mr Forshaw on whether it was true that Mr Slater sent him an image showing knives in his waistband, reminding him that he was under oath.\\'I wouldn\\'t lie,\\' he said. \\'I went to police off my own back.\\'At the close of his evidence, Dr Adeley instructed him to provide \\'proof\\' that \\'ten quid\\' was \\'common parlance\\' meaning £10,000, warning that there would be \\'serious consequences\\' if he did not comply.Before closing the videolink, the coroner gave him until 2pm to supply the information. Jay Slater\\'s brother Zak Slater arrives at Preston Coroner\\'s Court in Lancashire this morning Attempts to contact the Britons with whom Jay spent his final hours via mobile phone numbers and email addresses which they gave the Spanish authorities were unsuccessful, the court heard.Police served summonses on Ayub Qassim, who was renting the AirBnB he went back to, and fellow Briton Steven Roccas, known as Rocky, the coroner heard.But both were unknown at the addresses in London held by police.Witness summons were also issued for Jay’s friends Josh Forshaw, Lucy Law, Brad Hargreaves and Brandon Hodgson.Mr Forshaw responded to a summons and gave evidence, but Mr Hargreaves replied to say he would be away on holiday when the inquest was heard today, having booked the trip last October.Ms Law is currently in Tenerife, the coroner was told, while Mr Hodgson is also understood to be abroad.\\'We\\'ve been looking for them for months and we cannot find them,\\' Dr Adeley said. \\'We really tried, we just can\\'t find them.\\' Jay Slater attended the NRG music festival with two friends before his disappearance Asking about Mr Qassim and the fellow Briton whose AirBnb the teenager went back to, Mr Slater\\'s father Warren told the coroner: \\'The two people who can put some light on whatever happened to Jay aren\\'t in court today.\\'Dr Adeley said he understood his concerns.But he said evidence from Spanish witnesses given to the Tenerife authorities due to be spelt out to the hearing would corroborate the account Mr Qassim gave at the time.In August, hundreds gathered in Accrington to bid a final farewell at his funeral, as his coffin was laid to rest amid an encore of drum-and-bass music.During their eulogies, friends recalled Mr Slaters \\'buzzing and smiling\\' demeanour and told their late schoolmate to \\'keep partying hard up there\\'.His parents led the procession of mourners through the drizzle on August 10 to the service at the packed Accrington Crematorium Chapel, while many more watched on an outdoor screen.On November 21, a GoFundMe page titled Get Jay Slater Home was closed after it had received £72,821 worth of donations. Jay Slater\\'s mother Debbie Duncan arrives at Preston Coroner\\'s Court in Lancashire today The coffin of Jay Slater ahead of his funeral in Accrington, Lancashire, on August 10, 2024, where mourners wore the colour blue in his memory In a final post on the page, Mr Slater\\'s family said they had been able to give a \\'truly deserved… send-off\\' at his funeral.They also explained how the donations were spent, which included hiring a search team from the Dutch non-profit organisation Signi Zoekhonden and paying for their stay in Tenerife while they searched for the teenager\\'s body.The same coroner also presided over the inquest into the death of mother-of-two Nicola Bulley, who went missing while walking her dog after dropping her children off at school in in St Michael\\'s-on-Wyre, Lancashire, in January 2023.Her disappearance also provoked a storm of attention on social media with TikTok sleuths sharing outlandish theories.The 45-year-old\\'s body was found in the River Wyre three weeks later after a huge search effort which sparked global headlines.Dr James Adeley, senior coroner for Lancashire, later ruled that Ms Bulley\\'s death was accidental and that she did not have \\'any desire\\' to take her own life. That hearing took place amid tight security at County Hall in Preston, with members of the public who attended subjected to searches and warned against disrupting proceedings.By contrast, Mr Slater\\'s inquest is being held at Preston Coroner\\'s Court.\\n```\\n\\n## [Tottenham vs Manchester United live Europa League final updates, how to watch info and Ruben Amorim latest](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-vs-tottenham-live-31687771) (#32715)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 14:30:00+00:00\\n\\n```\\nIt\\'s Europa League final day as Manchester United take on Tottenham Hotspur at the Estadio de San Mames in Bilbao. United are potentially just 90 minutes away from winning a major European trophy which will see a difficult season end on a really positive note. It would represent Ruben Amorim\\'s first piece of silverware as United boss and victory also comes with the added boost of qualifying for next season\\'s Champions League. But they face a Tottenham side who have also endured a difficult Premier League campaign and have the same motivation as United to end their campaign with a European trophy and Champions League qualification.

His brother Corry, himself a former United academy graduate, now plays for Oldham and he played 85 minutes at York last night as the Latics booked a spot in the National League play-off final with a stunning 3-0 win.

He was named on the bench against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, and that starting XI will be close to what Amorim selects tonight. I think it would be a mistake not to start Garnacho. He opened the scoring against Manchester City in last season\\'s FA Cup final and he is a genuine goal threat, despite his scruffy finishing.Alejandro Garnacho\\'s post (Image: Instagram)17:08George SmithUnited\\'s biggest night in yearsAfter what happened in the final few minutes of extra-time against Lyon in the second leg of the quarter-final last month, something inside of me is telling me that United are destined to come out on top this evening.United have had to live up to the \\'Bilbao or bust\\' mantra for several months now, and they have passed every assignment that has come their way in their quest to reach the final. Now that they\\'re here and kick-off is looming, they need to make sure it counts.The outcome of tonight\\'s game will dictate which direction United\\'s recruitment heads in over the summer, how quickly Ruben Amorim can rebuild the squad and the mood around the club ahead of next season. This is their biggest night in years. Manchester United will be hoping it\\'s their name on the Europa League trophy.17:03Tyrone MarshallJust one more win is neededUnited’s run to Bilbao theoretically began at the Brick Community Stadium 500 days ago. That was when United won 2-0 at Wigan in the FA Cup third round last season. It was only winning that competition has led them here, as they qualified for the Europa League through the FA Cup. They have played 20 games since in the FA Cup and Europa League and lost none of them, somehow. One more win and a run of 21 ‘knockout’ games will lead them to the Champions League, despite the fact they continue to get worse in the Premier League.

As is commonplace for Uefa finals, a ring of steel has been erected around the stadium and the riot police were out in force when we arrived in Bilbao a couple of hours ago.It is a very calm atmosphere in the city. Athletic fans are understandably staying away and, as much of a cash-cow as the occasion is, one suspects the unfair reputation of English football fans will prove a deterrent for bar owners mulling over whether to remain open all hours.We walked past an Irish bar that was blaring out Bonnie Tyler. Some Spurs fans, all in colours, dined near us in a pizzeria and were very relaxed. (Image: Oli Scarff/AFP via Getty Images.)16:44Tyrone MarshallStrange atmosphere in BilbaoIt feels strangely subdued in Bilbao at the moment. The main square is reasonably lively and there’s a bit of a sing along but mostly United fans are in small groups having beers at various bars around Bilbao. The fan zone has been fairly sparsely populated and hasn’t looked to get close to its 20,000 capacity. We’re outside the stadium now. There is a ring of steel in terms of security and although there are supporters milling around, it’s still quiet. San Mames is right on the edge of the city centre so it is walkable even from the square and fan zone, so I don’t think it will get really busy here for another hour and a half or so. 16:35Steven RailstonAmorim not thinking about extra-timeAmorim was relaxed during his press conference yesterday.\"I just think the best starting XI to start the game. It is then really important to have options on the bench to change the game. Sometimes it is really important to win a final,\" he said.\"I am not thinking about going to extra-time. Of course, we have that possibility, but we never think about that. In the beginning of the game, I just want to win the game really fast. But as we proved against Lyon, if we have to score three goals in six minutes, we are able to do it.\"16:25Steven RailstonThe pick of the statistics Tottenham and United\\'s only previous meeting in major European competition came in the 1963-64 Cup Winners\\' Cup last 16, with United progressing 4-3 on aggregate.United are winless in their last six meetings with Tottenham (D2 L4), and have lost the past three in a row. The Reds have never gone seven without victory against Spurs, and have also never lost four successive matches against them.Tottenham have won the Uefa Cup/Europa League twice (1972 and 1984) and victory would see them become the second English club to win it three times, along with Liverpool. This will be United\\'s ninth major European final, with only Liverpool (15) reaching more among English clubs, but United have failed to win three of their past four.16:08Steven RailstonIrwin: \\'It\\'s a great occasion\\'Denis Irwin spoke to Sky Sports in the fan park earlier today.\"There hasn\\'t been too many finals where there\\'s been England opposition playing against each other. I was there in Moscow when we beat Chelsea,\" he said.\"Hopefully we can echo that kind of result tonight, although it would be a long night with penalties if it is like that.

Well, two of them really, Zirkzee surely won\\'t be fit to start.Yoro seems the most likely to get the nod from the beginning. As a centre-back his workload is smaller and he has only really missed a week of training. That means Lindelof can drop to the bench and Yoro can line up alongside Shaw and Maguire.Dalot is a valuable option off the bench but after a month out with a hamstring injury, I wouldn\\'t risk starting him. He can influence the game as a sub, so Mazraoui plays on the right and Dorgu on the left. Playing Mazraoui is balanced by Fernandes dropping into a deeper midfield role alongside Casemiro, with Ugarte the unfortunate fall guy.Moving Fernandes back will allow Amad and Mount to fill those No. 10 roles, with Garnacho primed for a role off the bench. Hojlund has to start as the striker.Tyrone Marshall\\'s Manchester United XI:11:47Sean McCormickSix players set to miss tonight\\'s finalThere wasn\\'t good news on Matthijs de Ligt. The defeneder has travelled to Bilbao with his teammates but will play no part in tonight\\'s game, meaning the Dutchman and Lisandro Martinez are the only two United players to miss out through injury.While United will be missing just two players tonight, Spurs have bigger problems. Dejan Kulusevski picked up a knee injury against Crystal Palace recently and will miss the final having undergone surgery, with James Maddison also set to miss out. The latter has travelled with the squad, sparking talk that he could make a return from injury having been ruled out for the season. However, Ange Postecoglou confirmed Spurs\\' injury situation hasn\\'t changed and so Maddison remains out of action. Postecoglou also confirmed that Lucas Bergvall is still sidelined. Radu Dragusin is a long-term absentee having ruptured his ACL in January and he will play no part tonight.Read the full story, here.11:27Steven RailstonZirkzee from the start?The biggest game of United\\'s season is finally here - the talking has ended and it is time for the players to deliver on the pitch. Amorim named a 26-man travelling squad for the game, but three players are guaranteed to miss out, and perhaps that\\'s evidence of him playing mind games with Ange Postecoglou.I\\'d start with Mazraoui, Maguire and Yoro in the back three, who should be able to limit Tottenham\\'s threat. It also makes sense to start Dalot and Dorgu at wing-back.Amad must start and I prefer him in the No.10 position for now, which means Dalot gets the nod at right wing-back in my team and Fernandes is dropped back into midfield alongside Casemiro.Tottenham will have prepared to face an out-of-form Hojlund in the Europa League final, so starting Zirkzee would provide some unpredictability and give United a slight advantage.11:18Sean McCormickUnited\\'s biggest fan is in BilbaoEddie Thomas has been to the Nou Camp, Moscow and Stockholm and seen United win the lot. And we caught up with him in Bilbao ahead of tonight\\'s final.10:55KEY EVENTMan United and Tottenham fans violently clash in Spain hours before Europa League finalFootage of a fracas between fans in Spain, ahead of the Europa League final between Manchester United and Tottenham on Wednesday night, has been widely shared on social media.The two Premier League teams have the opportunity to redeem their disappointing domestic seasons when they face off at Athletic Bilbao\\'s home ground tonight. A spot in next season\\'s Champions League is also up for grabs, with tens of thousands of fans from both clubs travelling to Spain for the crucial match.However, amidst the generally friendly interactions in Bilbao, shocking footage of a brawl in nearby San Sebastian, where fans were seen throwing punches and objects at each other, has emerged.Read the full story, here.10:40Sean McCormickAlan Shearer predictionThe former Newcastle and England captain believes Tottenham will beat United in tonight\\'s Europa League final.He told Betfair: This match is pretty impossible to predict when you look at how bad both teams have been. Spurs have done really well against Man United this season, so due to their record against them I\\'d say Spurs may be slight favourites.There are more negatives than positives for both teams when you look at them. I really haven\\'t got a clue what to expect or what teams will turn up. It\\'s a bit of a flip of a coin and it\\'ll be a disaster for whoever doesn\\'t win. Given what’s at stake for both clubs, it could have an impact on the game. There\\'s so much relying on both teams, managers and both clubs\\' short-term futures.There\\'s no exaggeration that both teams need an injection of five or six players to try and compete again and that\\'s why the stakes of this game are enormous.Just because of their record over the last five or six games against them, and particularly this season, I\\'ll go for a Spurs win. It wouldn\\'t surprise me if the game goes all the way to penalties, but I\\'ll go for Spurs to win in normal time. (Image: Getty Images)10:31Samuel LuckhurstUnited should make huge Hojlund call this eveningUnited have some genuine dilemmas. Yoro\\'s availability is significant and Noussair Mazraoui merits a start. It should be a point of principle not to start Luke Shaw when he has lined up four times within three weeks on the eve of a final. Ideally, United would not play Rasmus Hojlund. We know he will start but he shouldn\\'t. United won a trophy last season because Hojlund was taken out of the team for the FA Cup final and Bruno Fernandes would be an upgrade. You can play Fernandes anywhere and he will have an impact. United need to balance pragmatism with proactivism and not have the starting XI overloaded with defensive players.Samuel Luckhurst\\'s United XI:10:16Sean McCormickUnited and Tottenham fans clash in San SebastianUnited and Spurs clashed last night in San Sebastian, 48 miles away from Bilbao, on the eve of the Europa League final.Spanish publication El Diario Vasco report the disturbances began around 9:20pm.Their report read:According to witness accounts and videos shared by residents, the incidents began with shouts and insults between groups of fans. The situation quickly escalated when one of the individuals punched another, causing the other to fall to the ground. Several fans subsequently began throwing objects taken from terrace tables, overturning one and using it as a weapon against another group. Drinking glasses and trash cans were also thrown, creating chaos and danger for passersby and local businesses.We will have more updates on this story as and when we get them.09:49Sean McCormickGary Neville: United don\\'t deserve a parade if they win Europa LeagueGary Neville does not believe Manchester United deserve a parade if they win the Europa League.Speaking to the Stick to Football podcast, former United defender Neville said:“If Manchester United win, they’ll celebrate a trophy but there will be a cautious celebration tomorrow – not by the fans, though, because they’ll obviously go crazy.“Their interviews will be along the lines of them saying that they’re so happy and delighted for the fans, but it’s been a difficult season.“That will be the tone of it.

Mr Slater, from Oswaldtwistle in Lancashire, went missing in the early hours of 17 June 2024 after attending a music festival in Playa de las Americas on the Spanish island. Preston Coroner\\'s Court heard some of the 19-year-old\\'s friends and other witnesses \"could not be located\" despite months-long police efforts to find them.His mother Debbie Duncan shed tears in court as she asked senior coroner Dr James Adeley to \"bring these people in front of us\". Dr Adeley began the inquest by revealing two of the friends he had travelled to the island with, Lucy Law and Bradley Geoghan (also known as Bradley Hargreaves), were on holiday. A relative of Mr Geoghan told the BBC he had only been given the date for the inquest within the past 10 days and had provided the coroner\\'s office with evidence of a pre-booked family holiday overseas - which she said the court had accepted. She said he was happy to give evidence on the new date. Dr Adeley also said the Metropolitan Police in London had tried to locate Ayub Qassim and Steven Roccas, who were renting an AirBnB to which Mr Slater travelled in the early hours of 14 June, but neither man could be found. The apprentice bricklayer\\'s body was found by Spanish police in a remote national park on 15 July, with severe head injuries consistent with a fall from height. According to toxicology reports and his own messages, Mr Slater had been under the influence of drugs and alcohol, with traces of MDMA, cocaine and ketamine in his system when he died - although it was not clear how long before his death he had taken them.The inquest also heard Mr Slater had sent messages to friends on social media referring to being with \"two kids\" who had stolen a \"luxury\" watch from someone, and had sent a picture of himself with two knives. Mr Slater had got into a car and was driven to the AirBnB in the remote village of Masca, around 22 miles (36km) away from where he was staying.He was last heard from around 8:30 BST that morning, when he called Miss Law and told her he was lost and had 1% battery on his phone before the call cut out, she previously told the BBC. The disappearance of Jay Slater sparked a month long period of intense publicity on both mainstream and social mediaMiss Duncan said in court: \"How can we ever get any understanding?\"There\\'s things we want to question. \"We want these people to be sat in front of us, because our son went on holiday and didn\\'t come back, so there\\'s questions we need to ask.\"Dr Adeley adjourned for a short time to consider before announcing the inquest would be delayed. He told Miss Duncan: \"You wish to speak to the witnesses who last saw him. \"You heard the difficulties we\\'ve had trying to find these witnesses – Qassim and Roccas. \"In view of your distress we will make attempts to find them using whatever means we can.\"Earlier one witness who had agreed to take part, Joshua Forshaw, said he had got chatting to Mr Slater and his friends at the airport. He told the court the last time he saw Mr Slater was at the Papayago nightclub, which was hosting the NRG music festival, on the night of 16 June 2024. \"It wasn\\'t long after the event had started,\" Mr Forshaw said. \"He seemed to be in a happy mood, joyful to be there.\"The coroner pointed out that in his original statement Mr Forshaw had described Mr Slater as appearing to be \"off his head\" on drugs. In court Mr Forshaw said he believed Mr Slater had drunk a lot of alcohol, but was unsure about what drugs he had taken He said the last time he saw him Mr Slater told him \"some kids had just took an AP off somebody\" and that he was \"on his way to sell it for 10 quid\".He clarified that AP referred to a luxury watch brand and quid was a \"code for a grand [£1,000]\". Family handoutJay Slater was on holiday in Tenerife when he went missing Hours later, when he was in bed, Mr Forshaw received a video from Mr Slater showing him in an area of mountains, which he said was between 05:50 and 07:20 on 17 June.Mr Forshaw also told the inquest Mr Slater sent him a picture of himself with \"two knives in his trousers\", alongside the caption \"in case it kicks off\". He said he never saved the picture but later told Lancashire Police about it. Mr Forshaw said at 07:30 he went to the hotel where Mr Slater had been staying with his friend Mr Geoghan. While he was there, Mr Slater video-called Mr Geoghan through Snapchat.He said he could not recall much of the conversation, but said Mr Slater was talking about not being able to afford a taxi. He said Mr Hargreaves suggested they could sort the payment when it arrived at the hotel. When asked how Mr Slater sounded, Mr Forshaw replied: \"He wasn\\'t distressed, didn\\'t seem angry or anything, was just certain he was going to make it back home.\"He added he could not remember whether he told Mr Geoghan about the picture with the knives, which was sent a short time before the call. The court also heard a local man, Ramon Hernandez, had recalled meeting Mr Slater on the morning of 17 June in Masca as he and a friend were on their way to work. They said Mr Slater asked if a bus or taxi would take him to Los Cristianos, and they told him the next bus was due at 10:00 and the area did not have a taxi service.\\'No signs of attack\\'Det Ch Insp Rachel Higson, head of digital media investigations at Lancashire Police, examined Mr Slater\\'s phone and said it had recorded \"a lot of steps and inclines\".However she said there was nothing to suggest he was \"under any threat from anybody\".Giving evidence earlier, Dr Richard Shepherd, a consultant forensic pathologist, told the court Mr Slater\\'s cause of death was likely severe head injury.Dr Adeley asked if there were any signs of restraint or assault on the body, which the court heard showed signs of decomposition consistent with lying in a hot conditions for several weeks.Dr Shepherd responded: \"This is something I considered very carefully.\"The patterns of injuries when someone is assaulted or restrained or held or pushed are very different from the types of injuries or patterns I saw with Jay, so I saw nothing to suggest that was the case. \"He said it was not possible to completely rule out a push, as that would not leave a mark, but added there was \"nothing to suggest there was an assault, gripping, holding or anything of that sort\".Mr Slater\\'s disappearance sparked enormous media coverage and intense social media speculation, which boiled over into conspiracy theories and even malicious trolling of his friends and family.

The winners of Wednesday\\'s Europa League final between Manchester United and Tottenham in Bilbao could be the lowest league finishers ever to win a major European trophy.And they will certainly become the lowest team to ever qualify for the European Cup or Champions League.United sit in 16th place in the Premier League, with Spurs 17th - and a combined 39 league defeats.The only league games either have won since 2 February have been against sides who were relegated - or each other.Their points tally could have had them relegated in some previous seasons.\"I can\\'t remember such a game which was so highly pressurised for both teams,\" said former Celtic striker Chris Sutton on BBC Radio 5 Live\\'s Monday Night Club.And yet one of them will celebrate glory - and a return to the riches of the Champions League next season.Who has had the worse season?Media caption, Win or lose, will Postecoglou still manage Spurs next season?BBC Sport senior football correspondent Sami Mokbel and chief football news reporter Simon Stone, who will both be at San Mames for the final, have had their say on whose season has been worse.Mokbel on Spurs: \"Underperformed, underachieved, unacceptable. Domestically, at least.\"While Tottenham will cling on to hope of somehow turning a catastrophic season into a historic one, there can be no running away from the fact that results and performances have been largely disastrous.\"Twenty-one defeats in the Premier League and counting. Of course, all that will be forgotten if Spurs lift the Europa League trophy on Wednesday night.\"Whether that is enough to keep Ange Postecoglou in a job, however, is the million-dollar question with all the indications pointing towards the Australian departing regardless of the outcome in Bilbao.\"The fact Postecoglou\\'s tenure in north London looks set to end imminently illustrates just how pitiful their domestic campaign has been.\"In their defence, injuries have debilitated Tottenham\\'s season. They have lost key players for long periods of time.\"But this is an expensively-assembled Tottenham squad - one that includes the club-record £65m signing of Dominic Solanke.\"United are in a season of transition, having changed managers midway through the season.\"It\\'s different for Tottenham. Following Postecoglou\\'s encouraging first season in charge, in which Spurs finished fifth, this was a team set up to compete for Champions League qualification.\"Instead, they could finish one place above the relegation zone. That\\'s undeniably poor.\"Stone on United: \"Manchester United have been worse because much of the damage has been self-inflicted.\"United were the ones who reflected on Erik ten Hag\\'s tenure, both in the wake of their 4-0 defeat at Crystal Palace last May, then after the FA Cup final victory over Manchester City, and decided to stick with him.\"United gave him money to spend, specifically on Matthijs de Ligt and Joshua Zirkzee in the summer, then sacked him after nine games.\"And United told Ruben Amorim he had to start immediately, not wait until the summer to join from Sporting.\"Now, the safety net is Bilbao and then that United hit the ground running at the start of next season, which would justify the refusal to wait for Amorim.\"But, in the here and now, United have been woeful.\"There have been periods in games when they have looked fluid and their passing triangles have worked.\"However, Rasmus Hojlund has not looked a threat at one end of the field and basic mistakes have undermined them at the other.\"With six minutes left of extra time in their Europa League quarter-final against 10-man Lyon, it was not easy to strike a single optimistic note on United\\'s behalf. Somehow, they rescued themselves.\"Since then, United have got one point from five Premier League games. No-one has done worse than that. \"By any measure, this is United\\'s worst season since the 1973-74 relegation campaign. And they announced financial losses of £113.2m last September.\"To spend so much and be so bad really takes some doing.\"Who are the worst European winners ever?Media caption, Why Europa League loss would be worse for SpursOnly two teams have won a European trophy after finishing below 12th in their domestic league.That includes the old Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, European Cup Winners\\' Cup, Uefa Cup, European Cup, Champions League, Europa League and newish Conference League.The lowest-ranked team yet was West Ham just two seasons ago when they finished 14th in the Premier League but won the third-tier Conference League.The highest Manchester United or Spurs can finish is 14th - with several results having to go their way. The other lowest finishes have all come in various iterations of the Europa League.Inter Milan finished 13th out of 18 teams in Serie A in 1993-94, only staying up by one point (in the old system of two points for a win), but won the Uefa Cup.And a team finishing 12th have won it three times - Arsenal in the 1969-70 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, Schalke in the 1996-97 Uefa Cup and Sevilla in the 2022-23 Europa League.That Sevilla team are the lowest-placed to have ever qualified for the European Cup or Champions League - until now.Former Chelsea player Sutton said: \"There\\'s not going to be a great deal of quality on show. \"Both sets of players will be apprehensive and nervous.\"On Amorim and Postecoglou making changes in recent Premier League games, he added: \"I don\\'t understand why they are gripped by fear. Both managers want to go into the cup final with momentum. \"That really adds to the occasion and the pressure.\"The sixth all-English European final This will be the sixth all-English final in European competition - with all of those involving either Tottenham or Chelsea.England is the first country to have so many in Uefa competition (excluding the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup).Tottenham beat Wolves for the 1972 Uefa Cup final and Manchester United defeated Chelsea to win the 2008 Champions League.In 2019, both finals were all-English - with Liverpool beating Tottenham in the Champions League and Chelsea seeing off Arsenal in the Europa League.Chelsea beat Manchester City to win the Champions League in 2021.Who has the best trophy record?Both managers are looking for their first trophy in charge of an English club - but they have won silverware abroad.Postecoglou, 59, has the bigger trophy haul, although he has been managing a lot longer than his 40-year-old opposite number.Image caption, Excludes Super Cups, finals to decide the Australian league champions - plus those with Australia youth teamsAn important game for different reasonsMedia caption, Do head-to-head records matter in major finals?Both sides will be desperate to win this match, but their incentives are quite distinct.For Tottenham, this would be a first trophy since the 2008 Carabao Cup and their first European trophy since 1984.It would vindicate Postecoglou\\'s early-season declaration that he always wins a trophy in his second season.And somehow their worst domestic season since the 1970s could turn out to be their best in years.\"I\\'m sure if that happens on Wednesday night Ange will be smug walking off the pitch and say \\'see you later, I\\'ve told you what I do mate\\',\" said former Republic of Ireland goalkeeper Shay Given.Sutton reckons if Spurs lose, Postecoglou may not even be in charge for the final game of the Premier League season at home to Brighton on Sunday.\"If Postecoglou wins he\\'ll be hailed,\" said the former Blackburn forward. \"But just imagine the atmosphere against Brighton if Tottenham lose. \"I suspect he might not be in charge if that happens because that will be as toxic as anything.\"For Manchester United - who have won domestic cups in the past two seasons - Champions League qualification is the ultimate goal here.\"Financially, it\\'s the most important match in the club\\'s history,\" says football finance expert Kieran Maguire.Sutton feels the game is a potential \"get-out-of-jail-free card\" for Amorim.The Portuguese, who is hoping to oversee a summer rebuild, said: \"I think [qualifying for the] Champions League is more important for everything, to prepare the next season.\"We are supposed to be in the Champions League and the Europa League here is not enough, you have that feeling here. The best way to help us get to the top in a few years is the Champions League.\"The key statsOpta\\'s supercomputer says the game will be extremely close - giving Spurs a 50.3% chance of winning.Not only have Tottenham won all three meetings so far this season, but they have led for 90% of game time. United have yet to go ahead in any game.Since Ange Postecoglou took over as Spurs boss, only Brentford have dropped more points from winning positions in the Premier League.Three of the past four Europa League finals have gone to penalties.In the Premier League, Spurs\\' shot conversion rate of 12.8% is the sixth highest in the division. United are second bottom with 8.4%.Only Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (34) and Radamel Falcao (30) have scored more goals in the Europa League than United captain Bruno Fernandes (27), while he is top for assists (19) and total goal involvements (46).United keeper Andre Onana has been responsible for five errors leading to goals in all competitions this season.

I’ve had a lot of things going on off the pitch mentally. Sometimes there’s things in life bigger than football. This season I’ve struggled a little bit.

Solanke is the only decent No 9 on show in Bilbao and if he can get the better of his compatriot, it would put Spurs in the driving seat.“Looking at the photos I feel sorry for the glorious city of Bilbao having not one but two sets of English supporters foisted on it,” writes Richard Hirst. “I hope the Guggenheim is well wrapped up.“As to the match, I’m in the ABU team.

But maybe I’m wrong, what’s the mood on the streets?”I can’t imagine that one man represents an entire city.

Bellingham suffered the injury when he fell awkwardly during a match on 23 November and has been playing through pain and with it strapped since.The Spanish club take part in this summer’s revamped Club World Cup, which is being held in the United States between 15 June and 13 July. It is reported that the 21-year-old will have surgery when that tournament ends and faces a lengthy spell on the sidelines. That would be expected to rule him out of the start of next season’s LaLiga campaign as well as England’s World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia in September. PA MediaJohn Brennan is back! “I’d like to respond to the feedback I got about possibly thinking it might be better for United to lose tonight. I think that if they qualify for Champions League next season there is a high possibility they will not qualify the following season as they don’t have the strength in depth to cope with so many games. I think that if United get 2 good attackers in and maybe another central midfielder, there is a decent starting XI with a couple of bench options which could lead to a good season and get them in a position to build from there.“As for not minding if Spurs win, I don’t. If it was City or Liverpool I wouldn’t want them to win but Spurs, I couldn’t begrudge them a trophy. I’m sure Will, you felt similar when Palace won the Saturday, it probably bothered you a whole lot less than when United won the cup last year?”Athletic Club fans mingle with their Manchester United counterparts in Plaza Nueva.

The former Arsenal academy product changed his plea to guilty at a hearing on May 7 and this can now be reported after reporting restrictions were lifted on Wednesday.\\nEmmanuel-Thomas pleaded guilty at Chelmsford Crown Court in Essex to fraudulent evasion of the prohibition on the importation of cannabis between July 1 2024 and September 2 2024.\\nHe had previously denied the charges when asked to enter a plea in October last year.\\nThe footballer, whose former clubs include Ipswich, Bristol City, QPR, Livingston, Aberdeen and Thai side PTT Rayong, was remanded in custody ahead of his sentencing on a date to be fixed.\\nEmmanuel-Thomas, of Cardwell Road in Gourock, Inverclyde, Scotland, was arrested in the town by National Crime Agency (NCA) officers in September 2024. His arrest came after the NCA seized an estimated £600,000 of the class B drug as it was being smuggled through Stansted on 2 September.\\nBorder Force officers detected roughly 60kg (132lb) of the drug in two suitcases, which had arrived via a flight from Bangkok, Thailand. Co-defendants Rosie Rowland and Yasmin Piotrowska, who both denied the charge, face no further action after prosecutors offered no evidence in their case.\\nProsecutor David Josse KC said that “at all material times they maintained both before the events that led to the importation and after the events they said they thought they were importing gold not cannabis”.\\nJudge Christopher Morgan directed that not guilty verdicts be recorded in the case of Rowland and Piotrowska and they walked free from the dock.\\nRowland, 29, of Southend Road, Chelmsford, Essex, and 33-year-old Piotrowska, of Purves Road, Kensal Rise, north-west London, wept after leaving the dock.\\nEmmanuel-Thomas appeared at Wednesday’s hearing by video-link from Chelmsford Prison. He was asked if he would like to appear at his sentencing in person or by video-link and he asked that it be in person, with the date for this hearing to be set administratively. PA MediaGeorge Hayes responds to John Brennan: “Understand the concern that playing in the CL next season would be way above United’s level, and reduce the time Amorim has to bed in his ideas. But it’s plainly absurd for John Brennan to want his own team not to win a major European trophy, let alone also “not minding” if Spurs win.“If you can’t get excited about winning a trophy and qualifying for the CL, based on an unlikely FA cup win last year and some incredible games this season (while your club has been a raging bin fire), then really what is the point?”As does Topper: “Regarding John’s comment at 15:32. How can any “fan” want their team to lose. I’d rather deal with tomorrow, tomorrow.“Tonight is so huge, a loss would be unbearable, and could make the next few years dismal(ler)“A win and, I don’t care how we got there, Champions League will bring in some much needed money. Plus imagine if Chelsea or City didn’t qualify.”Cheers Baz. I am here and Sir Alex Ferguson is in Bilbao, ready for the big match.

Photograph: Tony O Brien/ReutersAn email: “As a Man United fan there is part of me that wants them to lose tonight,” writes John Brennan. “From a United perspective I think they really could do without European football next year to give Amorim a bit of space to bed in his ideas. I can see a scenario that if they qualify for the Champions League, they won’t have the depth to compete in that, their league form will suffer and by November, Amorim is given the boot with United down in 15th place or worse. It might go wrong even without European football but without, I think there is a better opportunity to right the ship.“Also, I wouldn’t mind Spurs winning a trophy. It looks like Ange is going to get sack either way and it would be quite entertaining to watch him give it both barrels in post match press conference.”You make some good points, John. However, as unromantic as it sounds, because of the Champions League riches that will pour into the coffers of tonight’s winners “this is the most important match in Manchester United’s history”. Not my words, but those of the academic and esteemed football finance expert Kieran Maguire.An email: “Spurs v Manchester United,” writes Billy Ditchburn. “Not so much two bald men fighting over a comb as two guillotined aristos haggling over a cravat.”268: That’s the number of flights Bilbao Airport was due to welcome today. To be honest, I have no idea how that compares to a normal day but it seems a lot. Of course lots of fans have eschewed the airborne travel option and have travelled by car, coach, train, boat or a combination of some or all of the above.I think if I had the time to spare, I’d like to have gone on the ferry from Portsmouth, a 33-hour voyage that set off on Sunday evening, with the boat due to dock in Bilbao around 9am yesterday morning. It sets off on its return voyage tomorrow morning.A Manchester United fan heads a ball and falls on pint glasses in Plaza Nueva. Photograph: Carl Recine/Getty ImagesFive hours to go! While I am painfully aware of the irony of somebody who is helming a rolling blog building-up to tonight’s Europa League final complaining about there being too much build-up to tonight’s Europa League final, I was just on the phone to a Tottenham-supporting friend and colleague who said “I’m all previewed out and just want the [f-word]ing match to start so I can either enjoy it or hate every minute of it”. I totally get it – so here’s hoping that when proceedings finally get under way in Bilbao in five hours time, we get an entertaining game after all this pre-match nonsense and speculation.No automatic qualification for host nations at Euro 2028Paul MacInnesThere will be no automatic places for the home nations when they host the men’s European Championships in 2028, Uefa have confirmed. England, Scotland, Wales and the Republic of Ireland will be expected to take part in the qualifying process for the tournament, though there will be a safety net for two of them should they fail.Uefa have previously only guaranteed participation to a maximum of two hosts. 2028 will be staged by four nations, however, after Northern Ireland’s Casement Park was withdrawn as a host stadium. Uefa’s solution to the problem of multiple hosts is to reserve places for up to two host countries who failed to qualify, with those places being determined by qualifying record.This approach both avoids unfortunate disputes between host countries and likely will guarantee more than two will make the tournament. England have failed to qualify for the Euros just once in the past 40 years, while Scotland and Wales have qualified twice since the tournament was expanded to 24 teams in 2016. Should more than two teams fail to qualify, however, they could still earn a place through the playoffs or via the Uefa Nations League.Uefa said: “Hosts England, Republic of Ireland, Scotland, and Wales will participate in qualifying, drawn into separate groups. The 12 group winners and 8 best runners-up (20 teams) will advance directly to the EURO 2028 final tournament. Two spots in the final tournament will be reserved for the two best ranked host nations who are not qualified as group winners or best runners-up after the completion of the qualifying group stage. The remaining spots will be assigned via play-offs between the remaining runners-up in the qualifying groups and the best ranked 2026-27 UEFA Nations League non-qualified group winners.”Football Weekly podcast: We discussed that frosty exchange between Ange and the Standard’s Dan Kilpatrick on today’s podcast. I don’t know Dan and while I understand the point he was trying to make about Postecgolou’s legacy at Spurs possibly being decided by the outcome of this final, his use of the word “clown” was probably uncalled for. Ange was well within his rights to call him out and if you’re prepared to dish it out, you have to be able to take it back when it comes your way.I would say Dan wasn’t helped by the subs who flagged up the word “clown” in the headline but hopefully he and Ange will be able to sort out any differences over a beer. Ideally with Tottenham’s manager helping to break the ice by turning up in a collapsible car while wearing massive shoes, baggy striped trousers, an Edwardian ruff and a big red nose.Ange Postecoglou: \"I\\'m not a clown and never will be\"A journalist from the London Evening Standard incurred the not inconsiderable wrath of Tottenham’s manager by writing “Postecoglou is therefore in a strange position, teetering between hero and clown” in a preview piece ahead of tonight’s final. When the same writer asked a similar question (without the c-word) at yesterday’s press conference, Ange gave him both barrels.“Irresepctive of tomorrow, I am not a clownn and never will be,” said Ange. “You really disappointed me that you used that terminology to describe a person that for 26 years, without any favours from anyone, has worked his way into a position where he isleading the club out in a European final. For you to suggest that somehow not being successful means I’m a clown, I’m not sure how to answer that question.” Postecoglou promptly directed his laser stare away from the journalist in question and fielded a different question from one of his colleagues.Welcome to Bilbao: It seems not all residents of Bilbao are happy to see their locale temporarily occupied by English football fans, as one Manchester United fan discovered after scaling some scaffolding to drape a banner over the Plaza Nueva. In case he doesn’t understand what this angry local poking him with what might be a snooker cue is saying, “Alde nire lurretik!” is the Basque for “Get off my land!”A Plaza Neuva resident takes exception and a bloody big stick to a Manchester United fan who made the unwise decision to muscle in on his territory. Photograph: Nick Potts/PAJamie Jackson: The Guardian’s bucket hat-wearing man on the Manchester beat is more self-contained media node than mere journalist and found a quiet corner of a bar in Bilbao so he could flap his gums with Talksport’s chief football correspondent, Alex Crook, on radio’s Hawksbee and Jacobs Show.“I think United may well do a number on Spurs tonight unless something mad happens like Bruno Fernandes, who is United’s best player, sees red again. I’m not saying that’s going to happen, by the way. Manchester United have done so well in this competition, I just get the feeling that …. Diallo is back, Fernandes is playing well and having arguably his best season considering all the turmoil. If he’d been out injured for a while, would United have been in a relkegation fight? Possibly.”Ed AaronsArsenal injury news: Mikel Arteta has confirmed that William Saliba suffered a hamstring injury against Newcastle on Sunday on the Frenchman’s 100th Premier League appearance and Jurrien Timber has had surgery on his ankle.“William is going to be out for a few weeks, unfortunately,” said the Arsenal manager, who also expects Timber to be sidelined for a similar period. Saliba is about to enter the final two years of his contract at the Emirates and talks are understood to have begun about extending it amid reports of interest from Real Madrid.William Saliba will miss Arsenal’s final game of the season with a hamstring issue. Photograph: John Walton/PAAn email: Picking up the thread pulled at by Will Unwin earlier, Jeremy Boyce writes. “Never mind the stadium, it’s all about Location! Location! Location!” he writes. “Bilbao itself is stunning. Your photos show in a small way how the whole place is steeply sloping, with big (bigger than anything in Britain) mountains coming right down to the sea. The city is built around a series of inlets, outcrops, gorges and rocks. I sincerely hope both sets of supporters take a bit of time away from the bars and fan zones and appreciate where it is that they actually are. It’s a beautiful place, but the motorway system around it is a bit mad, I had a near-death experience after getting myself confused trying to follow their jumbled signage.”Some Manchester United fans take time out from exploring Bilbao’s scenic mountains, inlets, outcrops, gorges and rocks to mingle with fellow supporters in the city centre. Photograph: Nick Potts/PAA beaming Son? In the event of a Lads, It’s Tottenham win this evening, no player is likely to be more pleased than Son Heung-min, whose smile will give the San Mamés Stadium floodlights a run for their money when it comes to lighting up the ground. The South Korean international is cautiously optimistic.“In the league, definitely where we are now obviously is unacceptable, but I don’t want to think about now that things are not good,” he said in his pre-match press conference. “Reaching the final, you have to beat some good teams as well. You have to travel to away games, have to make difficult games, you have to be disciplined and you have to have belief in yourself, which we did and that’s why we are in the final.“We can change the bad season in the league with a trophy and Spurs are just missing the trophy. Some seasons we have been outstanding, in the Champions League, finishing second, but still we were missing something. This year we can change that, so tomorrow, I hope we can change that.”Son Heung-min has yet to finish on the winning side in a final after nine years as a Tottenham Hotspur player. Photograph: Adam Davy/PATo parade or not to parade? While I have not heard of any plans for an open-top bus parade for Manchester United’s players and coaching staff if they win tonight, Gary Neville has declared there shouldn’t be one. “If Manchester United win, they’ll celebrate a trophy but there will be a cautious celebration tomorrow - not by the fans, though, because they’ll obviously go crazy,” he said on the Stick To Football podcast.“Their interviews will be along the lines of them saying that they’re so happy and delighted for the fans, but it’s been a difficult season. That will be the tone of it. I don’t think there should be a parade through the city for them winning the Europa League.”If Manchester United do win tonight and their players decide they quite fancy a parade, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, their penny-pinching co-owner, may well tell them to buy their own tickets for a 90-minute tour around the city on the Sightseeing Manchester Bus Tour. At £15 a head (£40 for a group of four and £8 for kids), it would constitute a bargain.Hello everybody and thank you, Will. Like pretty much everyone else, I have no idea who will win tonight’s Europa League final but I’m certainly looking forward to finding out. With all my eggs secure in a big Sunderland-branded basket ahead of Saturday’s Championship playoff final at Wembley, I have no dog in this particular fight.However, I would quite like to see Tottenham Hotspur prevail because I have always liked the cut of Ange’s jib, it would enrage the sizeable number of incredibly annoying Arsenal fans (many of whom I consider good friends) who drink in my local pub and I’m a football fan of a certain age who will never tire of seeing Manchester United lose, even if it has lost much of its novelty value in recent years. Anyway, those are my two cents, on the off-chance anyone is interested. Let’s crack on …I am off for lunch and will be replaced by Barry Glendenning. See you soon.Transfer news, courtesy of Jacob Steinberg.Need some audio content?

The two teams are aiming to put their rotten seasons behind them by claiming silverware with success in the Europa League.\\u200cWhile the final represents a huge chance to lift a trophy, it also offers each a chance to return to the Champions League. Each side have seen their hopes of playing in the competition evaporate due to their league positions amid woeful league form. But both sides can put that right in the Basque country.Both Ruben Amorim and Ange Postecoglou are each chasing a first trophy in English football. Both spoke in their pre-match press conferences on Tuesday, and while Amorim and the United camp were in relaxed mood, the Spurs boss was anything but - in spiky mood as he hinted at this being his penultimate Spurs match.Read the full story here.\\u200cKeir Starmer in huge winter fuel U-turn as he drops bombshell during PMQsSpeaking at PMQs, Mr Starmer dropped a winter fuel bombshellDuring PMQs this Wednesday, our politics team broke the news that Keir Starmer said he wanted more pensioners to get winter fuel payments in a huge U-turn on the controversial cut. The Prime Minister said with the economy showing signs of improvement he wants to ensure \"more pensioners are eligible for winter fuel payments\".The surprise announcement at PMQs - a fortnight after No10 ruled out a change in policy - came amid mounting pressure to roll-back the decision to strip the £300 payment from all but the very poorest pensioners. Labour has argued the unpopular decision - announced just weeks after the party\\'s election victory last year - was necessary to fix the Tory mess they inherited.\\u200cBut in recent weeks Labour MPs have blamed the policy for the party\\'s bruising results at the local elections earlier this month and defeat to Reform UK at a key by-election. Speaking at PMQs, Mr Starmer said: \"We all know the economy was left in absolute mess by the Tories. We had to stabilise the economy with tough decisions but the right decisions. Because of those decisions it is beginning to improve.\"Read the full story here.Eamonn Holmes, 65, and girlfriend Katie, 43, finally go Instagram official in sweet snapsEamonn Holmes and his girlfriend, Katie Alexander, have gone Instagram official(Image: Instagram)\\u200cWith their hawkish eye on celebs\\' Instagrams, our showbiz team spotted GB news presenter Eamonn Holmes and his girlfriend, Katie Alexander, go social media official after months of low-key holidays and date nights.

Israeli officials said 93 trucks entered Gaza on Tuesday, carrying aid including flour, baby food, medical equipment, and pharmaceutical drugs.But the UN said that despite trucks reaching the Palestinian side of the Kerem Shalom crossing, no aid has been distributed so far.Its spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said a team \"waited several hours\" for Israel to allow them to access the area but \"unfortunately, they were not able to bring those supplies into our warehouse\".Israel agreed on Sunday to allow a \"basic amount of food\" to enter Gaza, where global experts have warned of a looming famine.Meanwhile, the Hamas-run Civil Defence service said on Wednesday that 15 people, including a child, were killed in air strikes since midnight local time.International pressure on Israel has continued to grow.The UK said it would be suspending trade talks over what it described as Israel\\'s \"morally unjustifiable\" military escalation in Gaza, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer describing the situation as \"intolerable\".Meanwhile, the EU\\'s foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said the bloc would be reviewing its trade agreement with Israel in light of its actions in Gaza.Dujarric said the aid operation was made \"complex\" as Israel required the UN to \"offload supplies on the Palestinian side of the Kerem Shalom crossing, and reload them separately once they secure our teams\\' access from inside the Gaza Strip\". He added the arrival of the supplies was a positive development but described it as \"a drop in the ocean of what\\'s needed\". UN bodies estimate 600 trucks a day are required to begin tackling Gaza\\'s chronic humanitarian crisis.Earlier, the UN\\'s humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher told the BBC thousands of babies could die in Gaza if Israel does not immediately let aid in.Speaking to the BBC\\'s Today programme, Mr Fletcher said: \"There are 14,000 babies that will die in the next 48 hours unless we can reach them.\"When pressed on how he had arrived at that figure, he said there were \"strong teams on the ground\" operating in medical centres and schools - but did not provide further details.The BBC later asked for clarification on the figure from the UN\\'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), which said: \"We are pointing to the imperative of getting supplies in to save an estimated 14,000 babies suffering from severe acute malnutrition in Gaza, as the IPC partnership has warned about. We need to get the supplies in as soon as possible, ideally within the next 48 hours.\"It highlighted a report from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) which stated 14,100 severe cases of acute malnutrition are expected to occur among children aged six to 59 months between April 2025 and March 2026.The IPC report says this could take place over the course of about a year - not 48 hours.When pressed on the figures at a news conference, UNOCHA spokesman Jens Laerke said: \"For now let me just say that we know for a fact that there are babies who are in urgent life-saving need of these supplements that need to come in because their mothers are unable to feed themselves.\"\"And if they do not get those, they will be in mortal danger,\" he said. Last week, the Hamas-run health ministry reported 57 children had died from the effects of malnutrition over the past 11 weeks.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Tuesday welcomed Israel\\'s decision to allow some aid into Gaza, telling the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: \"We are pleased to see that aid is starting to flow in again.\" Replying to a Democrat who said the number of aid trucks allowed in was too little, Rubio said: \"I understand your point that it\\'s not in sufficient amounts, but we were pleased to see that decision was made.\"On Monday, the leaders of the UK, France and Canada issued a statement calling on the Israeli government to \"stop its military operations\" and \"immediately allow humanitarian aid to enter Gaza\".As part of its announcement on Wednesday, the UK also issued sanctions on several prominent Israeli settlers and settler-linked groups. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to Hamas\\'s cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.At least 53,475 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 3,340 since the Israeli offensive resumed, according to the territory\\'s health ministry.\\n```\\n\\n## [Trump to host South African President Cyril Ramaphosa](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/criticizing-south-africa-months-trump-will-meet-president-rcna207684) (#30698)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 11:00:40+00:00\\n\\n```\\nWASHINGTON —\\xa0President Donald Trump hosted South African President Cyril Ramaphosa at the White House on Wednesday in an effort to improve relations between the two countries after months of tensions. \"He is a man who is, certainly, in some circles, really respected,\" Trump said of Ramaphosa. \"Other circles, a little bit less respected, like all of us, in all fairness.\"Ramaphosa responded, \"We\\'re all like that,\" laughing.Elon Musk, who was born in South Africa, joined Wednesday’s meeting alongside several Cabinet officials. Musk has been a staunch critic of his birth country.Trump and Musk have falsely claimed that the Afrikaners, white descendants of Dutch and French settlers, were targets of a \"genocide.\" The administration admitted 59 white South Africans as refugees this month after they claimed they were fleeing violence and discrimination. South African leaders have fiercely disputed the genocide claims.\"We all know as South Africans, both Black and white, that there\\'s no genocide here,\" Ramaphosa said last week in a video clip on X. \"We are not genocidal. We are not committing any act of hatred, act of retribution or violence against anyone.\"President Donald Trump greets South African President Cyril Ramaphosa at the White House on Wednesday.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesRamaphosa told reporters Tuesday that his visit Wednesday would focus on potential trade and investment deals, as well as aim to “consolidate good relations between our two countries.” Trump has accused South Africa of being \"terrible\" to farmers, and in February, he said the United States would cut off aid to the country, alleging on Truth Social that South Africa was \"treating certain classes of people VERY BADLY.\"There were 12 murders on farms last year, The Associated Press reported, citing police statistics. One of the victims was a farmer, and the rest were farmworkers, none of whom were identified by race, according to the AP. White farmers own roughly three-quarters of South Africa’s privately owned land, according to government data.The White House has also criticized South Africa\\'s 2024 Expropriation Act, which allows the government, in some cases, to seize unused land without compensation or when there is public interest in redistributing it (a process similar to eminent domain laws in the United States.)Ramaphosa said in February that his government has not confiscated land.“The recently adopted Expropriation Act is not a confiscation instrument, but a constitutionally mandated legal process that ensures public access to land in an equitable and just manner as guided by the constitution,” he said on X.Still, the White House claimed that the law was a \"shocking disregard of its citizens’ rights\" and alleged that it followed actions \"fueling disproportionate violence against racially disfavored landowners.\" The administration used the act to prioritize refugee admission and resettlement for the Afrikaners, even as the Trump administration has shut down admitting refugees from most other countries, including Afghanistan, Sudan and Myanmar. One of Trump\\'s executive orders on his first day in office suspended the refugee admissions program, arguing that the country was not able to \"absorb large numbers\" of migrants and refugees in a way \"that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans, that protects their safety and security, and that ensures the appropriate assimilation of refugees.\"Afrikaners are minority white descendants of Dutch and French settlers who ruled the country during the apartheid regime, which ended in 1994. During apartheid rule, Afrikaners enforced racial segregation and confiscated land from Black residents.The X account for South Africa\\'s government posted in February that \"we look forward to engaging with the Trump administration over our land reform policy and issues of bilateral interest.\"\"We are certain that out of those engagements, we will share a better and common understanding over these matters,\" the post continued.Musk has also claimed that Starlink, his satellite internet service, is \"not allowed to operate in South Africa, because I’m not Black.\" Starlink would need certain licenses to operate in the country, and South Africa has regulations designed to ensure that a portion of foreign-owned telecommunications licenses are sold to historically disadvantaged groups. The U.S. and South Africa have also butted heads over the Israel-Hamas war, after South Africa accused Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. South Africa is leading a case in the United Nation\\'s International Court of Justice.The White House referred to the genocide allegations in Trump\\'s February executive order centering on Afrikaner refugees, saying that \"South Africa has taken aggressive positions towards the United States and its allies.\"Megan LebowitzMegan Lebowitz is a politics reporter for NBC News.Curtis Bunn, Abigail Williams, Joy Y.

The South African government has denied allegations of persecution or a “white genocide” in the country.\\nHere’s what you need to know about the law:\\nFILE PHOTO: Demonstrators hold placards in support of US President Donald Trump’s stance against what he calls racist laws, land expropriation, and farm attacks, outside the US embassy in Pretoria, South Africa, February 15, 2025 [Siphiwe Sibeko/Reuters]\\nWhat is the Expropriation Law?\\nPresident Ramaphosa signed the Expropriation Bill into law in January after months of debate in parliament due to opposition from the Democratic Alliance (DA) party, which is part of the coalition government.\\nThe law allows the government to seize land from any private owner, white or otherwise, for public purposes and public interests, including infrastructure projects, public service expansion, environmental conservation, land reform, or equitable resource distribution purposes.\\nWhile the law spells out fair compensation, it also allows for seizure without compensation in certain instances.\\nIt replaces a 1975 Expropriation Act drafted under apartheid, and criticised for being legally unclear and having no clear compensation plans.\\nSome Afrikaner groups, however, say the new law could see their land confiscated, perhaps violently, and it could plunge property values. The DA, a former opposition party to Ramaphosa’s African National Congress (ANC), is largely seen as representing white and Afrikaner interests.\\nWhite Afrikaners are descendants of mainly Dutch colonisers who, until 1990, controlled the country under an apartheid system that segregated and excluded the Black majority. Many of the most successful business leaders and farm owners in the country are still white.\\nWhite South Africans also collectively own 70 percent of the country’s land, despite making up just 7 percent of the population.\\nMore than half of the Black population, meanwhile, is categorised as poor. Only a minority of people have access to land. Ramaphosa’s government says the new law will help the government redistribute land to several categories of historically marginalised groups, such as Black people, women, and people with disabilities.\\nIn a statement in February, Ramaphosa’s office said the law was not a “confiscation” tool, but a needed policy to help distribute wealth evenly. Confiscation implies land seizure as punishment.\\n“The recently adopted Expropriation Act is not a confiscation instrument, but a constitutionally mandated legal process that ensures public access to land in an equitable and just manner as guided by the Constitution,” the statement read.\\n“South Africa, like the United States of America and other countries, has always had expropriation laws that balance the need for public usage of land and the protection of rights of property owners,” the office said.\\nBy mid-May, no land had been forcibly taken over by the South African government without compensation under the new law.\\nTesla CEO Elon Musk wears a ‘Trump Was Right About Everything!’ hat while attending a cabinet meeting at the White House, in Washington, DC, March 24, 2025 [Carlos Barria/Reuters]\\nWhat have Trump and his allies said about the law?\\nIn February, Trump ordered that US financial aid be cut to South Africa for the country’s “unjust racial discrimination”. In his order, Trump cited the alleged confiscation of white-owned land, as well as South Africa’s filing of a genocide case against Israel over its war on Gaza at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in December 2023.\\n“In shocking disregard of its citizens’ rights, the Republic of South Africa (South Africa) recently enacted Expropriation Act 13 of 2024 (Act), to enable the government of South Africa to seize ethnic minority Afrikaners’ agricultural property without compensation,” the order read.\\n“The United States cannot support the government of South Africa’s commission of rights violations in its country or its undermining United States foreign policy, which poses national security threats to our Nation, our allies, our African partners, and our interests,” Trump added.\\nBefore that, the US provided HIV aid to South Africa through the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR initiative. That aid was already halted when Trump paused US foreign aid globally in January.\\nTrump ally and South Africa-born entrepreneur Elon Musk is also highly critical of the land law, and is believed by some experts to be influencing the Trump government policies targeting the country.\\nMusk has accused the South African government of taking little action in stopping a “genocide” against white farmers. He has also criticised “racist ownership laws” for the failure of his satellite internet business, Starlink, to launch in the country. South African law requires that large businesses and those seeking government partnerships be partly owned by marginalised groups.\\nWhat other tensions exist between the two countries?\\nTrump has also highlighted allegations by a group of white South Africans who say white farmers face a disproportionate number of violent assaults on their farms, which they say amount to a “genocide”.\\nRamaphosa’s government denies those allegations and says farmer deaths are part of a larger crime problem. Farm attacks and murders are common in the country due to the remoteness of farm locations. Both white and Black farmers have been targeted in assault, robbery, and murder cases. The South African government does not publish data on racially specific crime.\\nThe issue of Gaza is also a tense one. The South African government filed an International Court of Justice case against Israel on December 29, 2023, accusing it of “genocidal acts” in its assaults on Gaza, to the anger of Israel’s ally and major weapons supplier, the US.\\n```\\n\\n## [South Africa\\'s Ramaphosa set to meet Trump amid tensions over \\'genocide\\' claim](https://www.france24.com/en/video/20250521-south-africa-s-ramaphosa-set-to-meet-trump-amid-tensions) (#30759)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 14:13:56+00:00\\n\\n```\\nWe and our partners do the following data processing based on your consent:store and/or access information on a device, personalised advertising and content, advertising and content measurement, audience research and services development\\n```\\n\\n## [Israeli army fires ‘warning shots’ at French and other diplomats visiting West Bank](https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20250521-israeli-army-fires-warning-shots-at-french-and-other-diplomats-visiting-west-bank) (#30761)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 13:34:08+00:00\\n\\n```\\nA group of foreign diplomats came under fire while visiting the Jenin refugee camp in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, according to the Palestinian Authority.

Even the United States, a staunch ally, has voiced concerns over the hunger crisis. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the government couldn\\'t continue talks on upgrading its existing trade agreement with an Israeli government pursuing what he called egregious policies in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. \"History will judge them,\" Lammy said. \"Blocking aid. Expanding the war. Dismissing the concerns of your friends and partners. This is indefensible. And it must stop.\"\\nIsraeli\\'s ambassador to the U.K., Tzipi Hotovely, was summoned to the Foreign Office, where Middle East minister Hamish Falconer said he would call the 11-week blockade of aid to Gaza \"cruel and indefensible.\" Separately, European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said the bloc was reviewing an EU pact governing trade ties with Israel over its conduct of the war in Gaza. She said \"a huge majority\" of member nations are \"very keen on sending this message that the suffering of these people is untenable.\" She did not provide clear details on timing and mechanisms for review. \\'Utterly intolerable\\' Lammy said the U.K. was imposing sanctions on a further \"three individuals, two illegal settler outposts and two organizations supporting violence against the Palestinian community.\" He said the illegal Israeli settlements were spreading across the West Bank \"with the explicit support of this Israeli government.\" Israel\\'s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Oren Marmorstein, called the sanctions against West Bank settlers \"unjustified and regrettable\" and said the free trade agreement negotiations were not being advanced by the U.K. anyway. While Lammy\\'s words were welcomed by some in the House of Commons, others called for stronger action, suggesting economic sanctions against Israel and recognizing the state of Palestine.\\nA handful of members shouted for him to call Israel\\'s actions \"genocide,\" though Lammy labeled it \"extremism\" and \"monstrous.\" Still others criticized the joint statement, saying it favored Hamas. \"Opposing the expansion of a war that has killed thousands of children is not rewarding Hamas,\" Lammy said. The U.K. announcement followed comments by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who called children\\'s suffering in Gaza \"utterly intolerable\" and repeated his call for a ceasefire. \"I want to put on record today that we\\'re horrified by the escalation from Israel,\" Starmer said.\\nStarmer calls for ceasefire On Monday, Starmer joined French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in issuing one of the most significant criticisms by close allies of Israel\\'s handling of the war in Gaza and its actions in the West Bank. The three leaders threatened to take \"concrete actions\" if the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not cease its renewed military offensive and significantly lift restrictions on humanitarian aid. Netanyahu called the statement \"a huge prize\" for Hamas. Starmer said a ceasefire was the only way to free the dozens of hostages Hamas still holds. He also called for increased shipments of humanitarian aid into Gaza, saying the basic quantity allowed by Israel is \"utterly inadequate.\" \"This war has gone on for far too long,\" Starmer said. \"We cannot allow the people of Gaza to starve.\"\\nWhile Israel allowed a first few trucks with baby food and desperately needed supplies to begin rolling into Gaza on Monday, U.N. humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher described it as a \"drop in the ocean of what is urgently needed.\" Israel said dozens more trucks entered Tuesday. Tensions between France and Israel Israel initially received widespread international support to root out Hamas militants following the group\\'s surprise attack that killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, on Oct. 7, 2023, and took 251 captives. But patience with Israel is wearing thin after more than 53,000 Palestinian deaths, mostly women and children, according to Gaza\\'s Health Ministry, which doesn\\'t differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count. Israel\\'s latest onslaught has killed more than 300 people in recent days, local health officials said. In recent weeks, Macron intensified diplomatic efforts to put pressure on Israel, urging a ceasefire and calling for lifting the blockade of humanitarian aid. Last month, Macron said France should move toward recognizing a Palestinian state, possibly in June when France and Saudi Arabia co-host an international conference about implementing a two-state solution.\\nMacron, who has said that recognizing Palestine is not a \"taboo\" for France, last week suggested that revisiting the EU\\'s cooperation agreements with Israel is on the table.\\nTensions between France and Israel have escalated after Macron called for stopping arms deliveries for use in Gaza in an October radio interview, prompting Netanyahu\\'s criticism. France also sought to impose a ban on Israeli defense companies to prevent them from exhibiting weapons at the Euronaval trade exhibition. Settler violence The U.S., France, the EU, the U.K. and Canada previously hit Israeli settlers and settler groups with sanctions for their involvement in violence against Palestinians and in illegal development in the West Bank. The measures expose the sanctioned people and groups to asset freezes and travel and visa bans. The Associated Press previously reported that these measures have had minimal impact as a deterrent. Settler attacks causing injury or death to Palestinians have surged since the Hamas attack in 2023. Israel says it opposes settler violence and blames it on an extremist fringe. Palestinians say the Israeli army does little to protect them and that the attacks are part of a systematic attempt to expel them from their land.\\n```\\n\\n## [South African president meets Trump at White House; administration faces questions over South Sudan deportations – live](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/may/21/donald-trump-jr-golden-dome-immigration-us-politics-live) (#31171)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 15:45:29+00:00\\n\\n```\\nFrom 2h agoTrump official says US seeking to deport eight serious criminals but declines to confirm South Sudan destinationA homeland security official said on Wednesday that the US is seeking to deport eight migrants convicted of serious crimes, Reuters reports, but declined to confirm an allegation raised in federal court that the deportees were bound for South Sudan.We’ll bring you more on this as we get it.Key events8m agoUS formally accepts gift of luxury plane from Qatar - New York Times27m agoSouth African president Cyril Ramaphosa arrives at White House for talks with Trump2h agoTrump official says US seeking to deport eight serious criminals but declines to confirm South Sudan destination2h agoUS abandons police reform accords sought over deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, and seeks to retract prior findings of wrongdoing by police departments3h agoJudge orders US officials to appear in court to answer questions about deportations to South Sudan3h agoTrump nominates Darryl Nirenberg as new US ambassador to Romania3h agoUS judge nixes treasury\\'s bid to cancel IRS workers\\' union contract4h agoDemocratic representative Gerry Connolly dies at age 756h agoKremlin says Russia and US should resume strategic stability contacts6h agoChina \\'seriously concerned\\' over US Golden Dome defense system6h agoTrump rolls out Golden Dome missile defense project and appoints leader7h agoDonald Trump Jr on running for president: \"that calling is there\"Show key events onlyPlease turn on JavaScript to use this featureTrump moves on swiftly to take the next question and Ramaphosa doesn’t get a chance to respond to that.Trump says “many people feel they’re being persecuted” and he floats that buzzword “genocide” as he talks about white farmers “fleeing South Africa”.And we’re straight in with a question for Trump about why the US should admit white Afrikaners as “refugees” when others are having protected status revoked.Trump attacks NBC News as fake news.He then says: “They say there’s a lot of bad things going on in Africa and that’s what we’re going to be discussing today.”He denies that the US isn’t letting others in, citing illegal immigration via the southern border and his usual tropes about what kind of people they are.Ramaphosa says he wants to “recalibrate relations”, saying the two have geopolitical issues to discuss and adds that he wants to discuss with Trump South Africa’s critical minerals.Ramaphosa says South Africa and the US are “longstanding partners” and he wants to “reset” the relationship in light of Trump’s trade announcements.US formally accepts gift of luxury plane from Qatar - New York TimesThe US has formally accepted the highly controversial gift of a luxury jet from the Qatari royal family, according to the New York Times.We’ll bring you more on this as we get it.Trump has begun this meeting with some (backhanded?) compliments for Ramaphosa, who he says is “respected in some circles, in others a little bit less respected”.He adds the South African president is “considered controversial in some circles”.After complimenting South African’s golfers, Trump says the two leaders will be discussing “some things you’ve read in the media” including the G20, and says: “We’ll see if we can help on some things in South Africa.”South African president Cyril Ramaphosa and Donald Trump hold a meeting in the Oval Office. Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/ReutersThis Oval Office meeting has the potential go full Zelenskyy, noted Politico this morning, given the months-long feud that has been brewing between Trump and Ramaphosa on a number of issues.You will remember that last week the Trump administration admitted 49 white Afrikaners to the US as refugees, with Trump repeating the falsehood that South Africa’s white minority faces “genocide” at home, a claim echoed by South African-born Elon Musk. Trump will no doubt press the South African president on this issue today. Per the Washington Post:\\nTrump has for years focused on the plight of Afrikaners descended from the colonists who built and led the nation’s brutal apartheid regime. Trump’s focus on South Africa’s relationship to its White minority appears to center on a new law that allows the government to expropriate land without compensation in rare cases — a measure leaders have cast as a ‘moral, social and economic imperative’ intended to help dismantle the legacy of racial apartheid.\\nCyril Ramaphosa himself has said the Trump administration has “got the wrong end of the stick” on this issue of the legacy of the racial injustice of apartheid and his government’s efforts to rebalance South African society in the face of inequalities that persist three decades after white minority rule ended.Indeed, the Trump administration has taken a number of aggressive actions on South Africa since Trump returned to power, which Politico notes include expelling its ambassador, ending all US aid to the country, and threatening to boycott the G20 summit that will be hosted by the nation later this year.What is more, the GOP more generally has taken issue with South Africa’s efforts to hold Israel to account for its assault on Gaza, via its case against Israel at the UN’s International Court of Justice which alleges that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza.It’s bound to be interesting, and I’ll bring you all the key lines here.South African president Cyril Ramaphosa arrives at White House for talks with TrumpDonald Trump has just greeted the South African president Cyril Ramaphosa at the White House, where the two leaders will hold bilteral talks expected to focus on trade and tariffs, but also on Trump’s perception of South Africa’s treatment of its white Afrikaner minority.Donald Trump greets Cyril Ramaphosa at the White House.

It states:\\nCommanders will take immediate measures to update personnel records and administrative systems to reflect biological sex for all individuals.\\nThe memo states that pronoun use when referring to individuals “must reflect their biological sex”, and that access to “intimate spaces” will be determined by an individual’s biological sex.The move is the latest by the Trump administration taking aim at trans members of the military despite years of service alongside all the other 2 million US troops.Here’s more on the Trump administration’s acknowledgment that it deported eight migrants after reports of a migrant flight to South Sudan.In a briefing on Wednesday, immigration authorities said the eight migrants had been convicted of crimes in the United States, the Associated Press reported.The eight men were from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, Vietnam and South Sudan, homeland security officials said, Reuters reported.Authorities said they had been convicted of murder, armed robbery and other serious crimes, according to Reuters. It cites homeland security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin as saying:\\nWe conducted a deportation flight from Texas to remove some of the most barbaric, violent individuals illegally in the United States. These are the monsters that the district judge is trying to protect.\\nImmigration authorities refused to say what the migrants’ final destinations would be, but said their home countries had refused to receive the migrants.US district judge Brian E Murphy in Massachusetts ordered an emergency hearing on Wednesday after immigrant rights advocates accused the Trump administration of deporting about a dozen migrants from countries including Myanmar and Vietnam to South Sudan in violation of a court order.Judge Murphy ruled that the Trump administration must retain custody and control of those “currently being removed to South Sudan or to any other third country, to ensure the practical feasibility of return” if he finds such removals were unlawful.Trump official says US seeking to deport eight serious criminals but declines to confirm South Sudan destinationA homeland security official said on Wednesday that the US is seeking to deport eight migrants convicted of serious crimes, Reuters reports, but declined to confirm an allegation raised in federal court that the deportees were bound for South Sudan.We’ll bring you more on this as we get it.Fellow lawmakers have called Gerry Connolly, who died this morning, a tireless public servant, and noted his work in recent months as his constituents - many tied to the federal government - grappled with cuts from the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s Doge task force.“Even as he battled a difficult cancer diagnosis, Ranking Member Connolly continued to push back against the unprecedented attacks on the federal workers in his district and across the country,” House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement.Virginia’s Republican governor Glenn Youngkin also offered his condolences in a post on X: “His decades of public service reflect a deep commitment to Virginia.” He did not say what steps would be taken to fill the House seat.We are deeply saddened by the passing of Congressman Gerry Connolly.

His killing, as well as the killing of Breonna Taylor who was shot to death by Louisville Police executing a no-knock warrant, sparked worldwide protests about racially-motivated policing practices during the final year of Donald Trump’s first term.Louisville and Minneapolis were the two most high-profile cities to be investigated during the Biden administration for systemic police abuse, and were the only two cities that agreed in principle to enter into a court-approved settlement with the DOJ known as a consent decree. Minneapolis also separately entered a similar type of settlement with the state of Minnesota to reform its police practices.Congress authorized the justice department to conduct civil investigations into constitutional abuses by police, and the civil rights division launched 12 such “pattern or practice” investigations into police departments including Phoenix, New York City, Trenton, Memphis and Lexington, Mississippi. But during those four years it failed to enter into any court-binding consent decrees, an issue that legal experts warned could put the department’s police accountability work at risk of being undone.Under Dhillon’s leadership, the civil rights division has lost more than 100 of its attorneys through deferred resignation agreements, demotions and resignations. And last month, she demoted senior attorneys who handled police abuse investigations to other low-level assignments, such as handling public records requests or adjudicating internal discrimination complaints.Those moves are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to upend the civil rights division’s traditions of pursuing cases to protect the civil rights of some of the country’s most vulnerable and historically disenfranchised populations.Since January, it has paused probes of alleged police abuse, launched its first investigation into whether Los Angeles violated gun rights laws, and following Trump’s lead, changed the department’s stance on transgender rights and probed alleged antisemitism at US colleges involving pro-Palestinian protesters.The department also recently ended a decades-old school desegregation order in Louisiana that came about in the wake of the supreme court’s Brown v. Board of Education case.Judge orders US officials to appear in court to answer questions about deportations to South SudanA federal judge has ordered US officials to appear at an emergency hearing today to answer questions about their apparent deportation of immigrants to South Sudan and other countries, The Associated Press reports.US district judge Brian E Murphy in Massachusetts ruled late on Tuesday that the Trump administration must retain custody and control of those “currently being removed to South Sudan or to any other third country, to ensure the practical feasibility of return” if he finds such removals were unlawful. Lawyers for the immigrants said the administration appears to have begun deporting people from Myanmar and Vietnam to South Sudan despite a court order restricting removals to other countries.The judge left the details to the government’s discretion, but said he expects the migrants “will be treated humanely”.Attorneys for the migrants told the judge that immigration authorities may have sent as many as a dozen people from several countries to parts of Africa. The lawyers say that violates a court order that people have a “meaningful opportunity” to argue that sending them to a country outside their homeland would threaten their safety.The apparent removal of one man from Myanmar was confirmed in an email from an immigration official in Texas, according to court documents. He was informed only in English, a language he does not speak well, and his lawyers learned of the plan hours before his deportation flight, they said.A woman also reported that her husband from Vietnam and up to 10 other people were flown to Africa on Tuesday morning, attorneys from the National Immigration Litigation Alliance wrote.The lawyers asked Murphy for an emergency court order to prevent the deportations.Murphy previously found that any plans to deport people to Libya without notice would “clearly” violate his ruling, which also applies to people who have otherwise exhausted their legal appeals.The judge summoned US officials to court today to identify the migrants impacted, address when and how they learned they would be removed to a third country and what opportunity they were given to raise a fear-based claim. He also ruled that the government must provide information about the whereabouts of the migrants apparently already removed.South Sudan’s police spokesperson major general James Monday Enoka told AP on Wednesday that no migrants had arrived in the country and that if they do, they would be investigated and again “redeported to their correct country” if found not to be South Sudanese.The state department’s annual report on South Sudan, published in April 2024, says “significant human rights issues” include arbitrary killings, disappearances, torture or inhumane treatment by security forces and extensive violence based on gender and sexual identity.South Sudan’s diplomatic relations with the US grew tense in April when a deportation row led to the revocation of visas and a ban on South Sudanese nationals.Trump nominates Darryl Nirenberg as new US ambassador to RomaniaDonald Trump has chosen Darryl Nirenberg, a lawyer and former Senate staffer, to serve as the next US ambassador to Romania, Reuters reports.The White House and state department have yet to comment on the outcome of Romania’s presidential election on Sunday, which was won by the centrist mayor of Bucharest, Nicusor Dan, who defeated a far-right candidate.Nirenberg, a longtime Washington lawyer currently at Steptoe LLP law firm, was chief of staff for late Republican senator Jesse Helms and was a counsel for the Senate foreign relations committee.The nomination requires approval by the Senate.\\n```\\n\\n## [Starmer pressed to ‘impose the strongest possible sanctions on Israel’](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/israel-prime-minister-british-northern-ireland-british-government-b1229060.html) (#31343)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 14:49:07+00:00\\n\\n```\\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has been urged to put\\xa0the “strongest possible political and economic sanctions on Israel” amid its latest military offensive in Gaza.Northern Ireland’s First Minister Michelle O’Neill has written to Sir Keir to express her “deep concern regarding the ongoing Israeli genocide in Gaza”.She said she acknowledged the joint statement issued by the British, French and Canadian governments, but said there is now an “urgent responsibility on world leaders to take serious action”.“We need an immediate and meaningful escalation in political and economic sanctions to pressure Israel to halt its military operations and comply with international humanitarian law,” she said.“The British government must take all necessary action to bring this to an end.“Under both domestic and international law, the British government has a legal and moral obligation to suspend arms sales when there is a clear risk that such weapons could be used to commit serious violations of international law.“That threshold has undeniably been crossed.”Ms O’Neill added: “The British government must impose the strongest possible political and economic sanctions on Israel while it continues its campaign of terror, horror and war against defenceless citizens.“Diplomatic condemnation must be matched with decisive action to exert maximum pressure to bring an end to the genocide in Gaza, and ensure accountability for violations of international law.“I urge you to show leadership, and to take strong and immediate action.“The world is watching, and the people of Gaza cannot wait any longer.”\\n```\\n\\n## [Government sends new aid to Gaza amid rising pressure on Israel to end blockade](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/government-israel-gaza-david-lammy-keir-starmer-b1229050.html) (#31352)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 14:34:26+00:00\\n\\n```\\nThe Government will send £4 million worth of aid to Gaza as it ramps up pressure on the Israeli government to lift a blockade on the region.The aid will include essential medicines, safe drinking water and food parcels.Minister for Development Jenny Chapman, who is visiting Israel and the occupied territories, said the lack of aid reaching Gazans is “appalling”.The move comes after the UK criticised Israel over its actions in the region.Jenny Chapman is calling for an immediate ceasefire (James Manning/PA)PA WireOn Tuesday, the Government suspended trade deal talks with Israel, sanctioned West Bank settlers and summoned the country’s ambassador, while foreign Secretary David Lammy described Israel’s actions as “monstrous”.Ms Chapman announced the new UK support during a visit to a Red Crescent centre, but expressed her frustration that much of it cannot yet reach them because of the Israeli restrictions.“The lack of aid reaching ordinary Gazans is appalling,” she said.“The Israeli government’s failure to allow full humanitarian access to aid workers is abhorrent. Far too few trucks are crossing into Gaza.“The UN has warned nearly half a million Palestinians, including children, are facing starvation.“The UK is clear – Israel will not achieve security through prolonging the suffering of the Palestinian people.“I have heard first hand from aid workers today of the abominable impact of this behaviour on real families.“The UK has today pledged new support for Gazans but the brutal reality is most of it is stuck in limbo.”“We need to see an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages, a surge of aid, and a path towards long-term peace,” she added.Humanitarian aid needs to get into Gaza “at pace”, Sir Keir Starmer told broadcasters as he visited a supermarket in north London on Tuesday afternoon.In response to the situation in the West Bank, Mr Lammy announced measures, including financial restrictions and travel bans, targeting prominent settler leader Daniella Weiss and two other individuals, as well as two illegal outposts and two organisations accused of backing violence against Palestinian communities.On Wednesday, Downing Street did not rule out that sanctions on Israeli ministers were possible in future after a report that No 10 and other countries were drawing up plans to target key figures in Benjamin Netanyahu’s government.The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said he would not speculate on future sanctions policy but said it has been made clear that if Israel does not cease its military offensive and lift aid restrictions then the UK will take further “concrete actions” in response.\\n```\\n\\n## [Israel encircles 2 of northern Gaza’s last functioning hospitals, groups say](https://www.foxnews.com/world/israel-encircles-2-northern-gazas-last-functioning-hospitals-groups-say) (#31447)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 13:17:46+00:00\\n\\n```\\nIsrael’s military\\xa0encircled two of the last functioning hospitals in the northern Gaza Strip, staff and aid groups say, as the World Health Organization is warning that the activity is \"stretching the health system beyond the breaking point.\"\\xa0The development comes as an Israeli military spokesperson said Wednesday that \"We are entering a new phase, different in size and strength, to achieve the war\\'s objectives of returning the kidnapped soldiers and defeating the terrorist [group] Hamas.\\xa0\"Forces from the 401st Brigade and the Givati Brigade, under the command of the 162nd Division, began operating in the northern Gaza Strip, where they identified and destroyed suspicious buildings in the area and eliminated dozens of Hamas terrorists,\" IDF Col.

It took place near the city of Jenin, a stronghold of Palestinian armed groups and a frequent target of Israeli raids.The Palestinian foreign ministry accused Israel of having “deliberately targeted by live fire an accredited diplomatic delegation”.The Israeli military said “the delegation deviated from the approved route”, prompting troops to fire “warning shoots” to keep them away from “an area where they were not authorised to be”.In a statement, the military said it “regrets the inconvenience caused” by the shooting, which resulted in no injuries, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu will hold a press conference on Wednesday night, Haaretz is reporting. No other details have been shared. We will update with more information when it comes in.Death toll from latest Israeli strikes on Gaza reaches 82Israeli strikes have continued to pound the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, despite international anger at Israel’s widening offensive.The attacks killed at least 82 people, including several women and a week-old infant, according to the Gaza’s health ministry and area hospitals. Earlier, the death toll had been put at 45 (see 10.59am BST).Scotland’s first minister John Swinney has welcomed international condemnation of Israel’s military offensive in the Gaza Strip.On Tuesday, UK foreign secretary David Lammy hit out at the new offensive and Israel’s restrictions on aid, saying the situation is “monstrous”. Ambassador Tzipi Hotovely was called in to the Foreign Office and the UK suspended negotiations on a trade deal with Israel. Middle East minister Hamish Falconer said the UK was also opposed to “rising violence and intimidation” by Israeli settlers in the West Bank.According to the PA news agency, Swinney said:\\nI welcome calls from the UK, France, Canada and many other countries condemning Israel’s intensified military operation in Gaza and blocking access for humanitarian aid. Israel’s actions and rhetoric are deeply troubling.\\nThe Scottish government has been consistent and forthright in calling for an immediate and sustained ceasefire, release of hostages, unimpeded access for humanitarian aid, compliance with international court rulings, and an end to licensed arms exports to Israel. And of course, a two-state solution, recognising the state of Palestine, so Israelis and Palestinians can live in peace alongside each other.\\nHistory will judge harshly those who prevent food and medicine reaching those most in need.\\nUK pledges £4M in humanitarian aid to GazaMore on the UK’s pledge in humanitarian aid to Gaza via Reuters.“The Israeli government’s failure to allow full humanitarian access to aid workers is abhorrent. Far too few trucks are crossing into Gaza,” the UK minister for development, Jenny Chapman said.She added:\\nThe UK is clear – Israel will not achieve security through prolonging the suffering of the Palestinian people.\\nThe UK on Tuesday paused free trade talks with Israel over its new offensive in Gaza, with foreign minister David Lammy calling for an end to the blockade of aid.The British Red Cross will receive the new aid package and deliver it through the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, the UK said.The UK pledged on Tuesday £4m ($5.37m) in humanitarian aid to Gaza, the government said, as the minister for development, Jenny Chapman, visited Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories.Spain has said it “strongly condemns” Israeli army fire on a diplomatic delegation that was visiting the flashpoint city of Jenin in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday, foreign ministry sources told AFP.“There was a Spaniard in the group of diplomats who is well. We are in contact with other affected countries to jointly coordinate a response to what happened, which we strongly condemn,” the sources said.German chancellor Friedrich Merz is very concerned about the humanitarian situation in Gaza and is in close contact with other European nations to convey his worries to the Israeli government, his spokesperson Stefan Kornelius said on Wednesday.“It is always important for the German government to keep its lines of communication open with the Israeli government and to be able to make its points directly,” he added at a regular government press conference.A group of diplomats came under fire while visiting Jenin, a city in the Israel-occupied West Bank, according to the Palestinian Authority.The diplomats were on official mission to observe the humanitarian situation in Jenin when shots rang out.\\nThere were no immediate reports if anyone was hurt and the Israeli military did not immediately comment on the shooting, AP reported.\\nAn aid worker, who did not want to be named for fear of reprisal, said a delegation of about 20 diplomats was being briefed about the situation in Jenin by the Palestinian Authority.The group of regional, European and western diplomats were standing near the entrance of the Jenin refugee camp when they heard gunshots just before 2pm, though it was unclear where the shots came from, she said.\\nJenin has been the site of Israel’s widespread crackdown against West Bank militants since earlier this year.Fine Gael’s four MEPs, who urged the EU to immediately suspend its trade and cooperation agreement with Israel in response to the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, have called for the EU to use its “full diplomatic weight” to push for an immediate ceasefire and an end to the aid blockade.Seán Kelly, Regina Doherty, Maria Walsh and Nina Carberry said this week’s decision to review the agreement was the right one, but it was long overdue and more could be done:\\nWe, along with our Fine Gael party, have long called for a full review of the EU’s trade and cooperation with Israel due to the country’s disproportionate action in Palestine. In view of war crimes such as forced starvation of ordinary people in Gaza, we are calling for the suspension of the EU-Israel association agreement immediately.\\nFood cannot be used as a weapon of war. Children, women and men are starving in Gaza. Gaza is now home to the largest number of child amputees in the world. Aid supplies must reach those in need immediately.\\nWe fully condemn the actions of the terrorist group Hamas, and urge the safe return of all hostages still held, but ordinary Palestinians should not suffer a collective punishment for the crimes of a terrorist group.\\nThis week again, we have seen protests by brave Palestinians calling for Hamas to relinquish control of Gaza. For too long innocent people have been caught in the crossfire, suffered unimaginable pain, hardship and loss. This should be acceptable to no one.\\nIreland stood almost alone when we first demanded action on Gaza, now the EU is finally catching up. This review of the Israel association agreement didn’t happen by accident. It happened because we pushed, persisted, and led.\\nThe review announced by the EU this week is a welcome step in the right direction. However, the EU’s full diplomatic weight should be used to push for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and end to the aid blockade. Sustainable peace will only be possible in the region when human rights and international law are respected.\\nPatrick WintourThree ministers responsible for arms exports to Israel have been summoned by parliament’s committee overseeing UK exports to explain possible loopholes in the rules.Liam Byrne, the chair of the business select committee has ordered the trade minister, Douglas Alexander, and the relevant ministers from the Foreign Office and Ministry of Defence and to offer urgent explanations.MPs are concerned that arms companies may be using the partial nature of the arms export ban imposed last September by the UK to send weaponry to Israel for use in Gaza, in breach of an undertaking by ministers.In his letter, Byrne raises concerns about statistics published on Friday that showed that in the fourth quarter of 2024 – after Labour’s partial arms export ban to Israel was imposed – the UK government nevertheless approved licences for £127.6m of military equipment to Israel. This is greater than the combined total for 2020-23, according to Campaign against the Arms Trade.Challenged on these figures by the independent Labour MP Zarah Sultana in the Commons on Tuesday, the foreign secretary, David Lammy, said he did not recognise the number and accused her of sensationalising the issue. He assured MPs “arms are not getting to Israel that could be used in Gaza”.However, the latest figures show the government authorised more than £61m in single-issue licences for military goods with an end user in Israel. This included licences for goods categories covering targeting systems, munitions and military aircraft parts.In his letter, Byrne points out that ministers assured MPs that the ban covered “equipment that we assess is for use in the current conflict in Gaza, such as important components that go into military aircraft, including fighter aircraft, helicopters and drones, as well as items that facilitate ground targeting”.Here are some of the latest images coming in via the newswires today:Displaced Palestinians line up to receive donated meals from a community kitchen at a tent camp in Gaza City on Wednesday.

He first played golf with Els, who lives in south Florida, eight years ago.“When I spoke to you, you said, ‘Yes, come along and bring Gary Player and Ernie Els and Retief Goosen.’ I brought the two of them,” Ramaphosa said.He said he spoke with Player, who turns 90 in November, and Player said he was getting in on years but wished them luck in the discussion. Trump awarded Player the Presidential Medal of Freedom on Jan. 7, 2021, one day after pro-Trump rioters attacked the White House.“We\\'re proud South Africans,\" Els said when Trump asked him to speak. \"We want to see things get better in our home country. That\\'s the bottom line. It\\'s been 35 years since the transition (from apartheid).“I know there\\'s a lot of anger through the transition, a lot of stuff happening in apartheid days. We grew up in the apartheid era. But I don\\'t think two wrongs make a right.”Els said Nelson Mandela “didn\\'t come out with hatred” when he was freed after 27 years in prison, instead working to unify South Africa through sport after being elected president in 1994. He cited the World Cup of Rugby in 1995, winning the African Nations in soccer and a few golf majors.Els won four majors, two each at the U.S. Open and British Open. Goosen, who recovered from being struck by lightning, won two U.S. Opens.Both were in Washington for the Senior PGA Championship, which starts Thursday at Congressional Country Club across the Potomac River in Bethesda, Maryland.“What I\\'m trying to say is this has been a long time coming. That\\'s why we really wanted to meet you and see our way forward,” Els said. “We still want to see our country flourish. ... There\\'s a lot of co-existence going on, but we need the U.S. to push this thing through.\"Goosen, whose father was a property developer and a part-time farmer, grew up in what now is Polokwane. He said his brother is still running the farm but “it\\'s a constant battle with ... them trying to burn the farm down to chase you away.”“It is a concern to try to make a living as a farmer,” he said.Els, known as the “Big Easy” for his fluid swing, first played golf with Trump in 2017 during his first term in office.“We didn\\'t talk politics because I\\'m not a man who can cast a vote,” Els told The Associated Press that year. “Whether you agree or not, I felt it was a duty to play with the president when you get the call. It\\'s basically honoring what the United States has done for me and my family.”___AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf\\n```\\n\\n## [Anti-Hamas protests in southern Gaza enter third day](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyvmmr154v2o) (#36024)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 18:22:09+00:00\\n\\n```\\n20 hours agoNaomi Scherbel-BallBBC News, reporting from JerusalemWatch: Crowds chant during Gaza anti-Hamas protestsPalestinians have taken to the streets in southern Gaza for a third day to protest against Hamas.Hundreds of demonstrators were seen in videos posted on social media calling for an end to the war and for the removal of the armed group from Gaza. \"Out! Out! Out! All of Hamas, out!\" they chanted.Speaking out against Hamas can be dangerous in Gaza and threats circulated on journalists\\' WhatsApp groups on Tuesday, forbidding them from publishing any \"negative news that could affect the morale of the people\".Activists said young people started the protests on Monday and were joined by others on their way to get food from community kitchens, who were still holding their pots.The protesters directed their anger at Hamas\\'s leadership after an interview with senior official Sami Abu Zuhri circulated on social media.Speaking on a podcast which originally aired in late March, he said that the war with Israel was \"eternal\", adding: \"We will rebuild the houses and produce dozens more babies for each martyr.\"Videos from the protests in Khan Younis show young men criticizing Hamas for selling their \"blood for a dollar… To those with Hamas, be aware the people of Gaza will dig your grave\".SuppliedActivists said young people started the protests in Khan Younis on MondayIn recent months, protests against Hamas have been on the rise in northern Gaza, but activists say the group\\'s presence in the south has remained strong and it has successfully suppressed public dissent until now.International journalists including those with the BBC are blocked by Israel from reporting in Gaza and anti-Hamas sentiment remains difficult to assess from afar.Israel has carried out daily air strikes on Khan Younis since Monday, when the Israeli army issued residents with one of the largest evacuation orders this year, telling those in the eastern half of the city to head immediately towards camps in the coastal al-Mawasi area.One man, who we are calling Alaa, was among those who started the protests. He agreed to speak to the BBC on condition of anonymity, for fear of reprisals from Hamas.\"The people do not care any more about Hamas\\' attempts to suppress their voice because they are literally dying from hunger, evacuation, and the bombings,\" he said.Alaa, who is originally from northern Gaza, said he had had to move around 20 times over the course of the 19-month war and could not afford to buy a tent for shelter.Previously imprisoned for taking part in anti-Hamas protests in 2019, Alaa said Hamas needed to leave.\"Resistance was not born with Hamas, and even if Hamas is gone, there will be other faces of resistance [to the Israeli occupation]. But this current policy will cost us all of Palestine and the nation.\"\"We just want our children to live in peace, and we deliver a message to the whole world, to try their best in pressuring Israel and Hamas so we can save us and our children from this war.\"In Gaza, public criticism of Hamas carries significant risks.In March, 22-year old Oday a-Rubai was abducted and tortured to death by armed gunmen after taking part in anti-Hamas protests in Gaza City.There are reports that others have been beaten, shot or killed for publicly opposing the group.Alaa said that as their protest approached Nasser hospital on Monday a group of men told them to stop.\"There was one man who wanted to pull out his gun, but his friend stopped him. They couldn\\'t do anything because they were outnumbered by the number of protesters.\"Moumen al-Natour, who is a lawyer, former political prisoner, and co-founder of the anti-Hamas protest movement, We Want to Live, said: \"The fatigue, effort and cost of displacement is pushing people to revolt against Hamas who refuse to surrender and hand over their weapons.\"The United Nations says that since 15 May, more than 57,000 people have been displaced in southern Gaza due to the fighting and evacuation orders.More than 53,000 people have been killed across Gaza since the start of the war, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, 82 of them in the past 24 hours.Israel launched a military campaign to destroy Hamas after the group\\'s cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages.\\n```\\n\\n## [Trump shows South Africa\\'s Ramaphosa a video montage in tense Oval Office meeting](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/21/nx-s1-5405517/trump-shows-south-africas-ramaphosa-a-video-montage-in-tense-oval-office-meeting) (#36281)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 21:53:22+00:00\\n\\n```\\nPresident Trump meets in the Oval Office with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. Bilateral relations are at their lowest since the end of apartheid.\\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: South African President Cyril Ramaphosa was in the Oval Office today trying, he said, to reset the relationship between the two countries. But President Trump had other plans. As the two leaders began to answer questions from reporters, Trump did something unusual.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Turn the lights down. Turn the lights down and just put this on. It\\'s right behind you, Johann (ph).UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: There\\'s nothing this parliament can do. With or without you, people are going to occupy land.KELLY: He showed a five-minute video montage to his guests. NPR\\'s senior national political correspondent Mara Liasson joins me now from the White House to explain. Hi, Mara.MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi there.KELLY: So explain - what was this video?LIASSON: Well, this was a planned moment, and the video showed leaders of a minority party in South Africa singing an apartheid-era struggle song called \"Kill The Boer\" - that\\'s B-O-E-R, which means farmer or Afrikaner. And that is something that Ramaphosa says the - says is rhetoric he rejects and always has.Whites, who account for about 7% of the population in South Africa, still own about 70% of commercial farmland. And white - while South Africa does suffer from high crime rates, Black people bear the brunt of violent crime in the country. But Trump has claimed for years, without evidence, that South Africa has allowed what he calls a genocide of white South African farmers, and so he showed him this montage that he said proved his point.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: But you do allow them to take land.PRESIDENT CYRIL RAMAPHOSA: No, no, no, no.TRUMP: You do allow them to take land.RAMAPHOSA: No. Nobody can take land...TRUMP: And then when they take the land, they kill the white farmer. And when they kill the white farmer, nothing happens to them.RAMAPHOSA: No, no. There is quite...TRUMP: Nothing happens.KELLY: So you can hear Ramaphosa there saying, no, no, no, no, no - pushing back. Tell me more about his reaction.LIASSON: Well, he came prepared for what clearly had the potential to be an explosive meeting. It\\'s as if the South African delegation went to school on the Zelenskyy meeting...KELLY: Yeah.LIASSON: ...Of course, that meeting that they argued on camera. The meeting ended abruptly. But Ramaphosa was prepared for an ambush. He was very calm throughout. He didn\\'t try to argue with the president. And he brought with him some friends - some powerful white friends - to help him try to convince Trump.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RAMAPHOSA: I would say, if there was Afrikaner farmer genocide, I can bet you these three gentlemen would not be here, including my minister of agriculture. He would not be with me. So it\\'ll take him - President Trump - listening to their stories, to their perspective.KELLY: OK, hang on, Mara. Who are these three gentlemen he\\'s referring to?LIASSON: There was his white minister of agriculture, who\\'s from an opposition party who vouched for Ramaphosa. He also brought two champion golfers from South Africa, including Trump\\'s friend Ernie Els, and a billionaire luxury good magnate Johann Rupert, who\\'s also a Trump friend. And their message was very simple. They said, you know what? We do have a crime problem in South Africa. We need to work with you, our great partner, on this. We need tech. We need Elon Musk\\'s Starlink. We need all sorts of other kinds of crime-fighting machinery like drones that can help us.KELLY: Sounds like quite a day at the White House - did they get to what Trump wants Ramaphosa to actually do?LIASSON: Well, he was asked that question directly, and he said, I don\\'t know. And later, he was asked if he was convinced that genocide was occurring in South Africa. And despite his insistence that it was, he said, quote, \"I haven\\'t made up my mind.\"KELLY: And how did all this end? I\\'m remembering, you referred to Zelenskyy\\'s Oval Office meeting, when that all went off the rails. He left the West Wing. He didn\\'t even get lunch. Did Ramaphosa?LIASSON: I think he got lunch.KELLY: (Laughter).LIASSON: He kept his eye on his goal, which is to get investment from the United States in South Africa, which of course would give business to U.S. companies. And we\\'re going to see which Trump emerges from these meetings - the expert practitioner of white identity politics, which he\\'s been his whole career, or the deal-maker looking for trade and investment deals, or maybe both.KELLY: NPR\\'s Mara Liasson at the White House.

While watching the video, Ramaphosa questioned the locations being shown, which he said he didn’t recognize as being in South Africa.The meeting “was a stark example of a foreign leader essentially trying to give a reality check to Trump, who instead amplified fringe theories,” said Zolan Kanno-Youngs, a White House reporter for The New York Times. There have been killings of white South Africans, but police statistics do not show that they are more vulnerable to violent crime than other people.

Since a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas broke down in March, Israel has withheld some aid in an effort to pressure the group to free dozens of remaining hostages.The Vatican estimated that some 40,000 people were present in St. Peter’s Square on Wednesday for the pope’s general audience, his first since being elected on May 8. Since then, he has used several public appearances to call attention to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, as well as the war in Ukraine.Three days after his election, in his first public remarks, he called for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza and called on Hamas to release hostages still held in the territory. The militant group’s attack on Israel in 2023 prompted the war in Gaza.“Let humanitarian aid be provided to the stricken civil population, and let all the hostages be freed,” he said in his first official message as pope.Videotranscriptbars0:00/0:58-0:00transcriptPope Calls for Humanitarian Aid and Peace in GazaPope Leo XIV made a renewed appeal to end the humanitarian crisis in Gaza during his first general audience at the Vatican.Dear brothers and sisters, I am happy to be with you in this, the first general audience of my pontificate.Pope Leo XIV made a renewed appeal to end the humanitarian crisis in Gaza during his first general audience at the Vatican.CreditCredit...Alberto Pizzoli/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesWednesday’s renewed appeal to end the humanitarian crisis in Gaza came at the end of the weekly general audience, a longstanding appointment that popes have kept with the faithful for years.

So all this must stop and that’s why we are determined to recognise a Palestinian state.”The developments come ahead of a UN-sponsored conference in New York starting on 17 June, co-hosted by Saudi Arabia and France.Officials at the conference will have to discuss the context for such a recognition of the state of Palestine. One question is whether there would need to be parallel recognition of Israel by states such as Indonesia and Saudi Arabia, something that is regarded as impossible in the absence of a clear path to a two-state solution.Israel is adamantly opposed to a two-state solution. The new US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, in an interview in Haarezt newspaper resisted the idea, saying: “I am asking whether there truly needs to be a Palestinian state.”One of the issue under discussion is whether recognising Palestine would have implications for companies or individuals who trade in the occupied territories.UK ministers are not expecting to announce further measures in the near future, but neither Jordan nor the UK has ruled out using air drops as was attempted last year.MPs are concerned that arms companies may be using the partial nature of the arms export ban imposed last September by the UK to send weaponry to Israel for use in Gaza, in breach of an undertaking by ministers.Three ministers responsible for arms exports to Israel have been summoned by parliament’s committee overseeing UK exports to explain possible loopholes in the rules.Liam Byrne, the chair of the business select committee ordered the trade minister, Douglas Alexander, and the relevant ministers from the Foreign Office and Ministry of Defence to offer urgent explanations.In his letter, Byrne raises concerns about statistics published on Friday that showed that in the fourth quarter of 2024 – after Labour’s partial arms export ban to Israel was imposed – the UK government approved licences for £127.6m of military equipment to Israel. This is greater than the combined total for 2020-23, according to Campaign against the Arms Trade.Challenged on these figures by the independent MP Zarah Sultana in the Commons on Tuesday, the foreign secretary, Lammy said he did not recognise the number and accused her of sensationalising the issue. He assured MPs: “Arms are not getting to Israel that could be used in Gaza.”However, the latest figures show the government authorised more than £61m in single-issue licences for military goods with an end user in Israel. These included licences for goods categories covering targeting systems, munitions and military aircraft parts.In his letter, Byrne pointed out that ministers assured MPs that the ban covered “equipment that we assess is for use in the current conflict in Gaza, such as important components that go into military aircraft, including fighter aircraft, helicopters and drones, as well as items that facilitate ground targeting”.He has asked for an explanation for the increase and the proportion of arms going to the Israeli state.He has also asked for the release of statistics on the number of licences that have been changed to remove Israel as the end user.The high court last week conducted a four-day judicial review of the UK government’s claim that it was lawful for the UK to sell components for F-35 fighter jets indirectly to Israel even though there was an acknowledged ministerial acceptance that those parts could be transferred for use in planes to bomb Gaza.\\n```\\n\\n## [Israel\\'s Western allies pull back amid Gaza escalation](https://theweek.com/world-news/israel-western-allies-denounce-gaza-offensive) (#37370)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 17:01:56+00:00\\n\\n```\\n\\'Israel is on the path to becoming a pariah state\\'\\n(Image credit: Kristian Buus / In Pictures via Getty Images)\\npublished\\n21 May 2025\\nWhat happenedBritain said Tuesday it was suspending talks with Israel on expanding their free-trade agreement due to the \"egregious policies\" of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\\'s government in Gaza and the West Bank.

Speaking at a news conference tonight, the Israeli PM said he is prepared to end the war \"under clear conditions that ensure Israel\\'s security,” which would involve the release of all remaining hostages in Gaza. The prime minister said 20 hostages seized by Hamas in the October 7, 2023 attacks are believed to be alive and up to 30 others have died. While Netanyahu said he was open to a ceasefire deal, conditions for this would include Hamas laying down arms, its leadership being exiled from Gaza and the strip being \"completely disarmed.\" Residents who want to leave Gaza will be able to leave, he added. During his statement, the prime minister also stressed the need to prevent a humanitarian crisis and unveiled a three-stage plan to get aid deliveries into Gaza. This plan includes the delivery of basic aid items into Gaza, opening food distribution points, and creating a zone to protect civilians after assuming security control of Gaza. According to the Israeli military, 100 aid trucks carrying flour, baby food, and medical equipment entered the Gaza Strip on Wednesday.However, UN officials said distribution problems had meant that no aid had so far reached people in need. It comes as numerous aid agencies confirmed that 14,000 babies were at risk of dying from malnutrition if aid does not reach them in the next 48 hours. The World Food Programme has said the movement of supplies was underway but that there had been no aid distribution yet. Israel\\'s military sent a late update that 100 trucks carrying flour, baby food and medical equipment had been transferred from Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza.Global experts have warned of an imminent famine in the territory.\"None of this aid - that is a very limited number of trucks - has reached the Gaza population,\" said Antoine Renard, country director of the World Food Programme (WFP).A United Nations spokesperson said trucks were still in the loading area of Kerem Shalom, the sprawling logistics hub at the southeastern corner of the Gaza Strip, because access to the rest of Gaza was too insecure to allow safe distribution.However, two merchants familiar with the matter said late on Wednesday that at least 15 aid trucks left the Kerem Shalom crossing en route to World Food Program warehouses in central Gaza.The Israeli blockade has left Gazans in an increasingly desperate struggle for survival, despite growing international and domestic pressure on Israel\\'s government, which one opposition figure said risked turning the country into a \"pariah state\".\"There is no flour, no food, no water,\" said Sabah Warsh Agha, a 67-year-old woman from the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya sheltering in a cluster of tents near to the beach in Gaza City. \"We used to get water from the pump, now the pump has stopped working. There is no diesel or gas.\"Thousands of tons of food and other vital supplies are waiting near crossing points into Gaza but until it can be safely distributed, around a quarter of the population remains at risk of famine, Renard said.Abdel-Nasser Al-Ajramy, the head of the bakery owners\\' society, said at least 25 bakeries that were told they would receive flour from the WFP had seen nothing and there was no relief for the hungry waiting for food.\"I\\'m here since eight in the morning, just to get one plate for six people while it is not enough for one person,\" said Mahmoud al-Haw, who waits in panicked crowds for up to six hours a day hoping for some lentil soup to keep his children alive.Israel imposed the blockade in March, saying Hamas was seizing supplies meant for civilians - a charge the group denies.\\n```\\n\\n## [Watch moment Trump confronts South Africa\\'s president with video](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cdedd1kn3ewo) (#38977)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 17:40:11+00:00\\n\\n```\\nUS President Donald Trump confronted his South African counterpart, Cyril Ramaphosa, over widely discredited claims of a white genocide in South Africa, during an Oval Office meeting on Wednesday.Mr Trump said that white farmers are \"fleeing South Africa\", playing footage to the room showing people chanting \"kill the Boer, kill the farmer\".Responding, Mr Ramaphosa condemned the chants but pushed back against claims of white persecution.You can follow the latest developments here\\n```\\n\\n## [Trump Claimed a Video Showed ‘Burial Sites’ of White Farmers.

A Times analysis found he misrepresented the contents of the video.A social media video of a memorial procession in South Africa was played during a meeting between President Trump and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.Credit...Eric Lee/The New York TimesMay 21, 2025In a White House meeting on Wednesday, President Trump showed President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa a social media video of a rural road lined with white crosses and hundreds of vehicles.Mr. Trump told Mr. Ramaphosa that the footage showed “burial sites” of “over 1,000” white farmers in South Africa.A New York Times analysis found that the footage instead showed a memorial procession on Sept. 5, 2020, near Newcastle, South Africa. The event, according to a local news website, was for a white farming couple in the area who the police said had been murdered in late August of that year.The crosses were planted in the days ahead of the event and were later removed.The misrepresentation of the footage took place during a stunning meeting in which Mr. Trump made false claims about a genocide against white farmers. Mr. Trump dimmed the lights to play the footage, presenting it as evidence of racial persecution against white South Africans.As the clip played, Mr. Trump said: “These are burial sites right here. Burial sites. Over a thousand of white farmers.”Contrary to Mr. Trump’s statements, the crosses are not gravesites for farmers and were not permanently placed along the road. Footage posted to social media before the remembrance event, in early September 2020, shows people setting up the white crosses, and Google Street View images from 2023 indicate they have since been taken down.There have been a number of protests against the killing of white farmers in South Africa. White crosses are known to be used at these events to represent slain farmers. Videos and photos at the Sept. 5 event also showed tractors adorned with flags condemning farm murders and a large banner reading, “President Ramaphosa, how many more must die???” stretched between two vehicles above the roadway. South Africa has an exceptionally high murder rate, but police statistics do not show that white South Africans or farmers are more vulnerable to violent crime than other people.A White House official told The Times each cross represented a white farmer who had been killed but did not comment on why Mr. Trump had characterized the video as showing burial sites.It’s unclear where Mr. Trump got the video from, or who, if anyone, characterized to him what the video showed. Elon Musk — who is originally from South Africa and is one of Mr. Trump’s advisers — had posted the video on the social media site X at least twice before today’s meeting.In Wednesday’s meeting, when Mr. Ramaphosa asked where the video was from, Mr. Trump said, “I mean, it’s in South Africa.”Riley Mellen is a reporter on The Times’s visual investigations team, which combines traditional reporting with advanced digital forensics.Aric Toler is a reporter on the Visual Investigations team at The Times where he uses emerging techniques of discovery to analyze open source information.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\\n```\\n\\n## [\\'Mic drop moment\\': Trump makes South African president answer for White genocide reports](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/may/21/mic-drop-moment-trump-makes-south-african-president-answer-white/) (#41040)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 22:28:02+00:00\\n\\n```\\nPresident Trump put South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on the spot Wednesday by screening a video of Black leaders calling for White Afrikaner farmers to be killed, an eyebrow-raising presentation that forced the visiting dignitary to answer for reports of genocide in his country.\\nMr. Ramaphosa was caught by surprise during a visit he said he hoped would “reset the strategic relationship between the two countries.”\\nMr. Trump has given credence to reports of atrocities against Afrikaners, canceled U.S. aid to South Africa and offered asylum to White farmers. He refused to allow Mr. Ramaphosa to gloss over the issue when they met in front of TV cameras in the Oval Office.\\n“We have thousands of stories talking about it, and we have documentaries. We have news stories,” Mr. Trump said. “I could show you a couple of things and … it has to be responded to.”\\nHe had the lights in the Oval Office dimmed as the video played on a large screen.\\nThe footage shown to the South African delegation, the White House press corps and the world featured clips of Julius Malema, an opposition politician who founded the Economic Freedom Fighters.\\nIn one of the clips, Mr. Malema tells a crowd that they “must never be scared to kill. A revolution demands that at some point there must be killing because the killing is part of a revolutional act.” In other clips, Mr. Malema sings the anti-apartheid “Kill the Boer” song.\\nA boer refers to the Afrikaners.\\nAnother part of the video showed aerial footage of miles of white crosses lining a road. Mr. Trump pointed it out to the South African president: “These are burial sites, right here.”\\nMr. Ramaphosa, who appeared to avoid looking at the TV screen, reacted with shock as he turned to see what Mr. Trump was pointing out.\\n“I’d like to know where that is because this I’ve never seen,” he said. “We need to find out.”\\nThe footage, however, was actually of the Witkruis Monument, a complex on private property featuring white crosses representing the victims of farm attacks.\\nMr. Trump handed the president printed articles, which he said were from the past few days. He said each page in the roughly 4-inch stack was a report of the killing of a White person in South Africa.\\nThe contentious meeting may have damaged Mr. Ramaphosa’s political standing at home. He badly needed a solid discussion on trade with the U.S., his nation’s top trading partner, to soothe jitters about South Africa’s economy. South Africa is battling high unemployment, tremendous income inequality and sluggish economic growth, and has lost its foreign assistance from the United States. The country doesn’t have the money to cover the $430 million shortfall caused by the Trump administration’s cuts in aid, the country’s finance minister said Wednesday.\\nBefore Mr. Ramaphosa’s arrival in Washington, his political rivals labeled the trip a fool’s errand. They warned that Mr. Ramaphosa would return empty-handed and look weak on the world stage if the meeting devolved similarly to Mr. Trump’s fiery meeting this year with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\\n“The video was definitely a mic drop moment for Trump. It is unprecedented to be showing footage like that in that setting,” said Elaine Dezenski, senior director and head of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies’ Center for Economic and Financial Power.\\n“I don’t know how this is going to play domestically for Ramaphosa because I’m not sure he’s coming back with anything concrete, and I think it was difficult for him to formulate a response to the video with the way Trump used it as a cudgel,” she said.\\nThe spectacle in the Oval Office drew criticism from Mr. Malema, the opposition politician featured in the video.\\n“A group of older men meet in Washington to gossip about me,” he said on social media. “No significant amount of intelligence evidence has been produced about White genocide. We will not agree to compromise our political principles on land expropriation without compensation for political expediency.”\\nMr. Trump has previously spoken about reports of a “White genocide” in South Africa. He granted refugee status to the White minority Afrikaners fleeing South Africa. The first group arrived this month.\\nRegardless of whether it qualifies as genocide, there is no doubt that people are being killed on South African farms.\\nAn estimated 225 people were killed on South African farms in four years ending in 2024, and nearly half of them were Black workers living on farms, The New York Times reported.\\nAfriForum, a minority rights organization for Afrikaners, recorded 40 deaths in farm attacks in 2023 and 50 in 2022.\\nThe South African officials in the Oval Office denied that the violence amounted to genocide. Mr. Ramaphosa said the speeches in the videos were “not government policy.”\\nWhen Mr. Trump asked about the killings of the White farmers, Mr. Ramaphosa said those killed through criminal activity were not only White but also Black.\\n“The farmers are not Black. I’m not saying that’s good or bad, but the farmers are not Black,” Mr. Trump said.\\nThe government has said any claims of persecution against White Afrikaners are “completely false.”\\n“The South African Police Services statistics on farm-related crimes do not support allegations of violent crime targeted at farmers generally or any particular race,” the South African Ministry of International Relations and Cooperation said in a statement.\\n“There are sufficient structures available within South Africa to address concerns of discrimination. Moreover, even if there are allegations of discrimination, it is our view that these do not meet the threshold of persecution required under domestic and international refugee law,” the ministry said.\\nMr. Trump takes issue with the Expropriation Act, which Mr. Ramaphosa signed in January. He cited the law when he signed an executive order in February suspending U.S. foreign assistance to South Africa.\\nThe law makes it easier for land to be expropriated in the public interest, making Afrikaner farmers fearful of losing their land.\\nThe Afrikaners are an ethnic group descended from colonial-era Dutch and German settlers in South Africa, a group distinct from the English-speaking Whites, such as Trump ally Elon Musk, who was present in the room and has spoken out about South Africa. The Afrikaners were the driving force behind the apartheid system of racial segregation that reigned in the country in the mid- and late 20th century.\\nSouth Africa’s Black-majority government passed the Expropriation Act in response to land-distribution inequalities left over from apartheid. White South Africans make up around 7% of the country’s population but own more than three-quarters of the private farmland in the country.\\nSouth Africa’s minister of agriculture, John Steenhuisen, acknowledged a “rural safety problem in South Africa. I don’t think anyone wants to candy coat that.”\\nAfter talking with farmers, he said, the majority “really do want to stay in South Africa and make it work.”\\nHe said the government wants the U.S. and other allies to help expand the South African economy and “shut the door forever” on the rebel groups like those in the video.\\nMr. Ramaphosa said the country denounces the language and violence. “Oh, yes. We’ve always done so,” he said.\\nJohann Rupert, a White South African billionaire at the Oval Office meeting, pleaded for help for the police, including drones and Starlink, the satellite-based, high-speed internet service owned by Mr. Musk.\\nMr. Rupert said the crime in South Africa targets both Blacks and Whites.\\n“We have too many deaths, but it’s across the board, it’s not only White farmers,” he said. “We need technology help.”\\nGolfer Retief Goosen talked about his family’s farm, stolen equipment, living behind electric fences, and an attack on his mother.\\n“They’re trying to burn the farms down to chase you away, so it is a concern to try and make a living as a farmer, and at the end of the day, without farmers, there’s no food on the plate. So we need the farmers to produce the food,” he said.\\nWhen asked by a reporter what he would like Mr. Ramaphosa to do about the situation, Mr. Trump sternly said, “I don’t know.”\\nHe said he had not determined whether genocide was occurring.\\n“I haven’t made up my mind,” he said. “I hate to see it.”\\n“If I can save lives, I want to save the lives,” he said. “If it’s in Africa, that’s great. If it’s in Europe, if it’s — wherever it may be.”\\nAfter the meeting, Mr. Ramaphosa said his visit “went very well.”\\n• Jeff Mordock contributed to this report.\\n```\\n\\n## [Trump plays a video for South African leader showing purported evidence of Afrikaner genocide](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/may/21/trump-plays-video-south-african-leader-showing-purported-evidence/) (#41047)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 17:35:07+00:00\\n\\n```\\nPresident Trump played a video in the Oval Office that seemed to show evidence of widespread violence against White South Africans, putting South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in an awkward and uncomfortable position.\\nMr. Trump has endorsed reports of a genocide against White farmers in South Africa and granted refugee status to the White minority Afrikaners who flee South Africa.\\n“We have thousands of stories talking about it and we have documentaries, we have news stories,” Mr. Trump said. “I could show you a couple of things and … it has to be responded to.”\\nMr. Ramaphosa and the South African delegation sat there uncomfortably watching the videos play.\\nWhen the video switched to show the burial sites of white South Africans, Mr. Trump pointed it out to the South African president.\\nMr. Ramaphosa asked Mr. Trump if he knew where that was.\\n“I’d like to know where that is because this I’ve never seen,” he said. “We need to find out.”\\nMr. Trump showed a series of articles he had printed out about White farmers being killed.\\n“When you look at the videos.

But there is also the separate issue of the targeting of white South Africans, especially Afrikaners, especially farmers. And many South Africans believe that it is a deliberate act to target those farmers, and they hear the rhetoric of Julius Malema, who Trump put on that video. By the way, in reaction to the meeting, Julia Malema posted statements in which he stood by his positions and his party reiterated the chant ‘kill the farmer.’ You have a situation that will lend itself to genocide, because this kind of incendiary rhetoric is being used to justify those farm killings, and that’s what Trump is pointing to.\\nMalema did, in fact, react to his inclusion in Trump’s video by doubling down, reiterating “Kill the Boer, Kill the Farmer” in a statement and calling it a chant of “liberation”:\\nMacCallum then played a clip from the late South African President Nelson Mandela’s inauguration ceremony, where he called for unity for “all South Africans, both black and white.”\\nReacting to the 1994 speech, Pollak said, “That is the South Africa with which the United States has a good relationship, not the South Africa of corruption, crime, and racial incendiary rhetoric that pushes an agenda of radical redistribution.”\\n“The woke ideas of racial redistribution are destroying the South African economy, just like they threatened to destroy our institutions over here,” he explained, before reiterating that Trump’s Oval Office display was “the best thing to happen to South Africa since the end of apartheid.”\\nOlivia Rondeau is a politics reporter for Breitbart News based in Washington, DC.

He also showed a memorial to victims of farm murders.\\nThe South African team was taken by surprise and quickly found itself on the back foot. South African golfers Ernie Els and Retief Goosen corroborated some of Trump’s concerns about farm attacks and violent crime in general.\\nThe day before, Ramaphosa had told reporters that he wanted to reach “a really good trade deal” with Trump. But the South African team had not offered any compromises, and evidently saw the primary purpose of their visit as correcting Trump’s “misinformation.”\\nAt the end of the day, speaking to a press conference, Ramaphosa appeared to admit that his team had not been properly briefed. He blamed the fact that some members of his delegation had “just arrived today, or late last night.”\\nAs for the private meeting that the delegation had with Trump after the Oval Office meeting, Ramaphosa said that it had been cordial. However, from his description, it seemed to have been quite superficial as well.\\n“Following that engagement which you all witnessed, we retired to what I think they call the Cabinet room, where we were able to have really good in-depth exchanges with President Trump and his other officials. The discussion revolved, of course, around golf, but they also revolved around issues of trade and investment,” he said.\\nRamaphosa did claim one victory: he said that Trump had moved off his refusal to attend the G20 summit in Johannesburg, South Africa, in November. South Africa currently heads the G20 and passes the presidency to the United States later this year.\\nTrump implied that his attendance would depend on reform in South Africa, but did back away from an outright refusal to attend, which had been the administration’s previous stance.\\nJoel B.

winter fuel payments – Swinney](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/prime-minister-labour-government-keir-starmer-scottish-government-b1229078.html) (#31317)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 15:32:42+00:00\\n\\n```\\nNo U-turn can change the fact the UK Government removed the winter fuel payment from pensioners, John Swinney has said.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced on Wednesday his Government will reconsider the criteria for the payments after it cut availability within weeks of taking office last year.Speaking to the PA news agency during a visit to Glasgow Airport, First Minister Mr Swinney said regardless of the extension of the payment, it was still removed from most pensioners last winter, while his Government committed to offering a scaled back version of the payment in the upcoming winter.The First Minister, however, refused to commit to passing on all increases in funding from the UK to the Scottish equivalent.“I think people were dumbfounded that the first actions of the new Labour Government was to take away winter fuel payments from pensioners,” he said.“Now the SNP Government has intervened and we’ve restored those payments to pensioners in Scotland and that was the right thing for us to do.“But it was the wrong thing for the Labour Government to do to take away those payments.“We don’t know what the Prime Minister is proposing to do, it’s one line at Prime Minister’s Questions, so no amount of humming and hawing from the Prime Minister will detract from the fact that Labour took away the winter fuel payments and the SNP has restored them in Scotland.”Last year’s decision to remove the universal element from the winter fuel payment forced the Scottish Government to delay the creation of its own alternative due to worries about funding.A means-tested alternative, which will provide some level of cash to all pensioners in Scotland, is due to be in place for this winter.Asked if he would guarantee any additional funding from the Prime Minister’s announcement on Wednesday would be used to bolster payments to Scottish pensioners, the First Minister said: “Let’s see what comes out of this process from the Prime Minister.“We’ve always got to look at what is the net effect of changes that are made by the UK Government.”The Scottish Secretary said the shift is ‘the right thing to do’ (Ben Whitley/PA)PA WireAlso speaking at the airport on Wednesday, Scottish Secretary Ian Murray praised the decision of the Prime Minister.“It’s the right thing to do,” he said.“There will be nobody watching this or listening to this that didn’t appreciate the really dire situation that we took on in July last year, the fact it was even worse than we had anticipated.“We’ve had to stabilise the economy.”He admitted some decisions taken by his Government were “unpalatable”, adding: “Of course they were going to be unpopular, but we had no choice to do what was in the national interest to stabilise the economy.”\\n```\\n\\n## [Keir Starmer confirms U-turn on winter fuel payment cuts](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/21/keir-starmer-confirms-u-turn-on-winter-fuel-payment-cuts) (#31763)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 14:55:05+00:00\\n\\n```\\nKeir Starmer has confirmed that he wants more pensioners to be eligible for winter fuel payments after a backlash against one of the most unpopular policies of the Labour government.The prime minister indicated in the Commons that he would look again at the £11,500 threshold over which pensioners are no longer eligible for the allowance, as he tries to win back public support and quell a growing Labour backbench rebellion over benefit cuts.However, No 10 was unable to confirm whether the winter fuel U-turn would come into effect by this winter if announced in the autumn budget – or how many of the approximately 10 million pensioners who lost it would have it restored.The reversal comes despite Downing Street ruling out making changes to winter fuel payments after the Guardian revealed that it was rethinking the cut amid anxiety at the top of government that the policy could wreak serious electoral damage.The decision to means test the previously universal payment was one of the first announcements by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, after Labour’s landslide election victory last year and has been widely blamed for the party’s collapse in public support.Party activists said the decision to axe £1.5bn in winter fuel payments last July, limiting them to either £200 or £300 a year to pensioners in England and Wales who receive means-tested pensions credit, came up repeatedly on the doorstep during this month’s local elections.Anxious Labour MPs had been piling pressure on Starmer to change his mind over the cut. No 10 officials feared the strength of feeling could have an impact on their broader plans for welfare reform with previously loyal backbenchers threatening to rebel in a crunch vote in June.At prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, Starmer told MPs: “I recognise that people are still feeling the pressure of the cost of living crisis, including pensioners, as the economy improves.“We want to make sure people feel those improvements as their lives go forward. That is why we want to ensure that as we go forward, more pensioners are eligible for winter fuel payments.”The government has insisted the policy was necessary to help stabilise the public finances, allowing the improvements in the economic picture which Starmer said could result in the partial reversal of the measure.“Because of those decisions, the economy is beginning to improve,” he said, citing growth figures and interest rate cuts, plus the hoped-for impact of recent trade arrangements with India, the US and EU.“As the economy improves, we want to take measures that will impact on people’s lives, and therefore we will look at the threshold, but that will have to be part of the fiscal event,” he added.Numerous ministers and Labour MPs have described the winter fuel decision as a policy disaster that has created huge ill-feeling among voters, prompting the re-examination of the policy.However, finding a mechanism to widen eligibility for the payment will cause headaches in Whitehall after the decision to link it to the pension credit threshold. Officials fear that simply increasing the pension credit threshold would increase take-up of that benefit, wiping out any potential savings.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionAge UK’s charity director, Caroline Abrahams, welcomed the prime minister’s commitment to change the winter fuel policy but said “the devil is always in the detail and we postpone judgment until we hear more”.Meanwhile, Liz Kendall, the welfare and pensions secretary, said efforts to cut the welfare bill, that have caused deep unease across the Labour benches, were a key tool in the fight against Reform UK.Kendall told an audience at the IPPR that the controversial policies, which include tightening eligibility for the personal independence payment benefit, were “crucial to fighting the rise in populist politics”.She said: “The truth is welfare reform is never easy and it is rarely popular, perhaps especially for Labour governments. But no Labour government can resign from taking decisions because they are too difficult, because this is not good enough for the people we came into politics to serve.”Reflecting on Labour’s fight against Reform UK, Kendall said the government’s policies would “ help ensure our welfare state is sustainable for the future”. She also said they were “crucial to fighting the rise in populist politics, which offers easy but empty solutions to the people we came into politics to serve”.It comes after 100 Labour MPs, more than a quarter of Labour’s parliamentary party, signed a letter urging ministers to scale back welfare cuts under consideration.Despite this, Kendall said she was “listening carefully” to the concerns raised by Labour MPs about the measures, although she indicated she would not back down from the proposals.\\n```\\n\\n## [Starmer reveals U-turn on cuts to winter fuel payments as Labour MPs threaten revolt and Reform surge in polls](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/kemi-badenoch-keir-starmer-prime-minister-diane-abbott-cabinet-b1228998.html) (#32445)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 11:52:23+00:00\\n\\n```\\nSir Keir Starmer has signalled a U-turn on the deeply controversial cuts to winter fuel payments.He made clear at Prime Minister’s Questions that the Government was looking at relaxing the restrictions on the payments which currently mean only people getting Pension Credit, or similar benefits, are eligible.He highlighted that the UK economy was the fastest growing in the G7 group of wealthy nations and cuts to interest rates.But with inflation hitting 3.5%, he added: “I recognise that people are still feeling the pressure of the cost of living crisis including pensioners.“And as the economy improves, we want to make sure people feel those improvements as their lives go forward.“And that is why we want to ensure that as as we go forward more pensioners are eligible for winter fuel payment.”Challenged by Tory leader Kemi Badenoch to make clear whether the Government was planning to “U-turn” on the decision to cut the winter fuel allowance, Sir Keir added: \"As the economy improves, we want to take measures that will impact on people\\'s lives.

The Prime Minister has faced increasing pressure to change course following backlash on the move that stripped millions of the annual payment, worth up to £300, last winter.Starmer\\'s stepdown represents a huge victory for The Express who led the crusade to reverse Labour\\'s cruel stance. During Prime Minister\\'s Questions on Wednesday, Sir Keir said: “I recognise that people are still feeling the pressure of the cost-of-living crisis, including pensioners. As the economy improves, we want to make sure people feel those improvements in their days as their lives go forward. That is why we want to ensure that, as we go forward, more pensioners are eligible for winter fuel payments.” He said the Government will “only make decisions we can afford” and will therefore look at this as part of the next fiscal event. So, what is the winter fuel payment, and who is currently eligible?Sir Keir Starmer has announced plans to make more pensioners eligible for the Winter Fuel Payment (Image: Getty)What is the Winter Fuel Payment?First launched in 1997, the winter fuel payment is a tax-free benefit to help older and vulnerable Britons meet the costs of heating their homes.The payments, which are distributed by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) are typically made between November and December every year to those eligible.Who is eligible for the Winter Fuel Payment?The payment was previously available to everyone above the state pension age (currently 66) in the UK, but in the 2024/25 tax year, new rules enforced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves meant only state pensioners on means-tested benefits would qualify. Ms Reeves said the move would help save the Government between £1.3billion and £1.5billion per year.In line with new rules, people currently qualify for a winter fuel payment if they were born before September 23, 1958. They must also live in England or Wales and get one of the following benefits:Pension CreditUniversal CreditIncome-related Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)Income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA)Income Support.The move stripped the payments away from an estimated 10 million pensioners.However, following mounting pressure from Labour ranks, Sir Keir has said the criteria will change again to make “more pensioners eligible” for the payment. It’s currently not clear what the new threshold will be, how many more will be eligible, and when the changes will come into effect.Charities fear hundreds of thousands will still miss out on the payment due to \"complex\" benefit application processes.Lucy Bannister, head of policy and influencing at charity Turn2us, said: “We welcome the Prime Minister’s indication that the Government plans to widen eligibility for winter fuel payment, helping more low-income pensioners to stay warm and safe this winter. We hear from people every year about the difference this support makes.“But we remain concerned that hundreds of thousands of eligible pensioners still miss out each year due to a complex application process, lack of awareness, and stigma. Many feel shame for needing support, a direct result of how benefits are too often talked about by politicians and the media. The Government must urgently ensure its narrative around its wider social security reforms reduces this stigma, simplify the system, and proactively reach those being left behind.” Invalid emailWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you\\'ve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

That is why we want to ensure that as we go forward more pensioners are eligible for winter fuel payments.”The PM said the change is likely to come in “at a fiscal event”, meaning it is set be confirmed by Rachel Reeves at next month’s spending review.HuffPost UK revealed earlier this month that the chancellor was holding talks in Downing Street on changing the winter fuel policy, which she announced shortly after Labour won the election last July.Downing Street had initially denied it had any plans to water down the policy, despite it being partly blamed for Labour’s disastrous result at the local elections.Labour MPs also made clear their anger directly to Starmer at a meeting in parliament on Monday evening.HuffPost UK understands that advisers close to the PM were vehemently opposed to any climbdown, but the decision was eventually taken that the political damage it was doing to Labour’s support was too great.Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said: “The world’s longest u-turn continues. The prime minister has today announced the ‘concepts of a plan’ that have come far too late for the millions of pensioners forced to freeze in their own homes over the winter. “The least those people deserve is an apology for this punitive policy and a serious proposal from the prime minister on how he will begin to pick up the pieces from his government’s disastrous decision.”\\n```\\n\\n## [Starmer\\'s winter fuel U-turn seeks to calm Labour nerves](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj933dngwlyo) (#34566)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 12:13:47+00:00\\n\\n```\\n1 day agoHenry ZeffmanBBC chief political correspondentThe details will follow in the Budget this autumn. But make no mistake, this is a U-turn.The decision to means-test the winter fuel allowance was one of the first announcements made by Sir Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves almost a year ago. It was intended to demonstrate both the dire state of the government\\'s economic inheritance and the new regime\\'s willingness to take tough decisions in response.It didn\\'t quite turn out that way. Early grumblings from MPs generally on the Labour left rapidly spread into more unexpected parts of the party. Even those MPs who made a decent fist of defending the policy right to the end admitted that it was the most frequently raised issue by members of the public when they were out campaigning.It was widely blamed for a bad set of local election results and the dismal defeat to Reform at the Runcorn and Helsby by-election on the same day.Now the prime minister has announced that the government would look again at the threshold to allow \"more pensioners\" to qualify for the payment.There is an interesting debate even among those MPs who were clamouring for a U-turn of this sort about whether the policy was always destined to be a failure. Some believe that it was intrinsically inept to target a benefit paid to pensioners. Others believe the threshold should have been set higher so that fewer pensioners lost out. Another group say that if the Budget - with a big tax rise and funding boost for public services - had come at the same time, it would have made the winter fuel policy less isolated and as a result less controversial.And yet another group believe that the government\\'s failure lay in neglecting to make a positive case for the policy. Instead of sorrowfully saying they had been forced into the means-testing by Conservative misrule, this argument goes, Sir Keir and Ms Reeves should have argued that there were many pensioners who simply did not need the money.All that is of academic interest now. A consensus had formed across the Labour Party that the policy was a colossal political misstep and from that point on the logic facing this prime minister - who is utterly unsentimental about moving on from old policy positions - was remorseless.Why now though? One reason may be that rumours had reached overdrive that an announcement was in the offing. Given that ministers\\' conspicuous non-denials were becoming non-stop, there may have been a calculation that it made more sense just to acknowledge the inevitable now.But it is also worth considering the broader context. Winter fuel was by no means the only contentious element of this government\\'s economic policy. There is a rebellion brewing on the government\\'s welfare cuts. Those are likely to face a vote in the Commons next month although estimates of how big the rebellion might be vary wildly.The government is in no mood to concede on that issue - as demonstrated by Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall\\'s speech this morning. Apart from anything else, they cannot afford to - at least without choosing to change their main tax plans or their borrowing rules. The welfare reforms raise far more money than the means-testing of winter fuel was meant to.But Sir Keir and his party whips will now be able to reassure anxious Labour MPs that they do listen to their complaints, even if they cannot address them in every area.Fundamentally this is embarrassing for Reeves. She made a big, bold and early call and has reversed it within 10 months. Her economic and political judgment is increasingly widely questioned within her own party - as demonstrated, just as one example, by the memo from Angela Rayner\\'s department splashed across the front page of the Telegraph this morning.The most important verdict on this reversal, though, will come from the public.

In a U-turn following mounting political pressure in recent weeks, the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced plans to ease cuts to winter fuel payments.Around 250,000 people here missed out on the winter fuel payment last year after Northern Ireland followed a Westminster decision to make the payments means-tested. On Wednesday, Lyons welcomed the government\\'s realisation that an \"error\" was made and urged for the return of the \"universal winter fuel payment that protects all pensioners\". Take the \\'worry off old people\\'Speaking to BBC News NI, Lyons said he knows \"how difficult it is to administer benefits. I know how difficult it is to means test benefits as well\". He said it would \"save everybody a lot of time, a lot of hassle, and take a lot of worry off old people who have been concerned over what they have gone through over the last year… the best and simplest way to do this is to reinstate this in full\".He further urged the Labour Government not to \"make the same mistake twice\". Last year, an extra £17m was found following a Stormont monitoring round and Lyons secured this money to grant a £100 one-off payment to support pensioners who were affected by cuts to winter fuel support. What are Winter Fuel Payments?Winter Fuel Payments were created in 1997 to help everyone above state pension age with their winter heating bills. The Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced last year that winter 2024 will be the first time pensioners in England and Wales will not be eligible for the payment. Northern Ireland was forced to follow suit. Payments were then restricted to those on benefits and pension credit. This resulted in 180,00 NI households losing out on the payment.\\n```\\n\\n## [Christian Calgie fumes \\'thousands of elderly people have already died\\' after Keir Starmer\\'s winter fuel U-turn](https://www.gbnews.com/politics/christian-calgie-keir-starmer-winter-fuel-payment-u-turn) (#40871)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 21:56:21+00:00\\n\\n```\\nPolitical commentator Christian Calgie has launched a scathing attack on Keir Starmer\\'s handling of winter fuel payments, claiming that \"thousands of elderly people will have died this winter\" due to the policy.His comments come as the Prime Minister signalled a U-turn on the controversial cuts to the winter fuel allowance.Starmer has confirmed he will reassess the unpopular winter fuel policy that has caused significant backlash among Labour MPs.Speaking about this on GB News, Calgie said: \"I don\\'t think Keir Starmer really has a view on the economy and that\\'s the problem. In fact, Keir Starmer doesn\\'t have strong views on many things. \"But the fact is, they managed to persuade a lot of people that they had a plan for the economy when they didn’t. They just kept talking about stability.\"The issue with that message was this: for all his faults, Rishi Sunak had brought the country back to stability. He got inflation down to two per cent .\"That’s why today we keep hearing Labour talk about Liz Truss because they want us to forget the real economic inheritance they received: two per cent inflation.\"The Bank of England was on course to cut interest rates before Labour came into power. \"And now they\\'ve landed themselves in a massive mess boxed in by completely made-up so-called fiscal rules created by Rachel Reeves, all because the financial markets are so jittery.\"But there’s another point and this one is just as serious. The problem with the winter fuel U-turn isn\\'t just political; it\\'s human. \"I have no doubt in my mind that potentially thousands of elderly people will have died this winter as a result of that decision.\"We don’t talk about it enough.\"Speaking during PMQs earlier today, Starmer told MPs: \"I recognise that people are still feeling the pressure of the cost of living crisis, including pensioners. \"As the economy improves, we want to make sure people feel those improvements in their days as their lives go forward.\"He added: \"That is why we want to ensure that as we go forward, more pensioners are eligible for winter fuel payment. \"As you would expect, Mr Speaker, we would only make decisions we can afford. That is why we will look at that as part of our fiscal event.\"The Prime Minister was responding to a question from one of his own MPs PAThe Prime Minister was responding to a question from one of his own MPs about protecting the savings of older people struggling with rising living costs.The controversial policy has dramatically reduced the number of pensioners eligible for the winter fuel benefit from 11.4 million to just 1.5 million. Under the changes implemented by the Labour government, payments were restricted to poorer households already receiving pension credit or other means-tested benefits.The Treasury had hoped the measure would save around £1.3billion annually. However, the cut has proved hugely unpopular among voters.\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

However, as Russia failed to achieve its military objectives as quickly as it had wanted, the group expanded its targeting to include entities involved in the delivery of support and aid to Ukraine’s defence. Over the past three years, its victims have included organisations involved in air traffic control, airports, defence, IT services, maritime and port systems sectors across various Nato countries.\\nThe advanced persistent threat (APT) actor is also understood to be targeting internet-connected cameras at Ukraine’s border crossings and around its military bases. These intrusions mostly took place in Ukraine but have also been observed in neighbouring states including Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia.\\nThe GCHQ-run National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) urged UK organisations to familiarise themselves with Unit 26165’s tactics and take action to safeguard themselves.\\n“This malicious campaign by Russia’s military intelligence service presents a serious risk to targeted organisations, including those involved in the delivery of assistance to Ukraine,” said Paul Chichester, NCSC Director of Operations.\\n“The UK and partners are committed to raising awareness of the tactics being deployed. We strongly encourage organisations to familiarise themselves with the threat and mitigation advice included in the advisory to help defend their networks.”\\nThe NCSC’s latest warning comes a couple of weeks after the cyber body’s CEO, Richard Horne, talked of a “direct connection” between Russian cyber attacks and physical threats to the UK at its annual conference.\\nHorne told an audience at the CyberUK event that Russia was focusing on acts of sabotage, often involving criminal proxies. He said these threats, which are thought to have included arson attacks, are now manifesting on the streets of the UK, “putting lives, critical services and national security” at risk.\\nStaple tactic\\nRafe Pilling, director of threat intelligence at the Sophos (formerly Secureworks) Counter Threat Unit (CTU) – which tracks Fancy Bear as Iron Twilight – said that the group\\'s targeting of spear-phishing and vulnerability exploitation to gain access to target mailboxes had been a staple tactic for some time.\\n“The focus of their operations pivots as the intelligence collection of the Russian military change and since 2022 Ukraine has been a significant focus of their attention. The targeting of Nato\\u202fand Ukranian defense and logistics companies involved in the support of the Ukrainian war effort makes a lot of sense in that context,” Pilling told Computer Weekly.\\n“The targeting of IP cameras for intelligence collection purposes is interesting and is a tactic generally associated with state-sponsored adversaries like Iron Twilight where they anticipate a physical effects aspect to their operations. As an intelligence provider to the Russian military this access would assist in the understanding of what goods were being transported, when, in what volumes and support kinetic targeting.\\n“We’ve seen other APT actors make use of compromised CCTV feeds to monitor the effects of cyber-physical attacks, for example the 2022 attacks against steel mills in Iran where video from the CCTV feed was used to time the execution of the attack in an attempt to avoid harm to people at the site and confirm the damage being caused,” he added.\\nThe NCSC said Britain’s support for Ukraine remained “steadfast”. Having already committed £13bn in military aid, the UK this week announced 100 new sanctions on Russia targeting entities and organisations involved in its energy, financial and military systems.\\nThis comes in the wake of the largest drone attack on Ukraine staged so far during the three-year war, which Russian dictator Vladimir Putin launched mere hours before a scheduled call with US president Donald Trump.\\nThe full advisory – which can be read here – sets out Fancy Bear’s tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) in its latest campaign in accordance with the Mitre ATT&CK framework, and details a number of the common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) being used to attain initial access.\\nBesides the UK and US, the advisory is cosigned by cyber and national security agencies from Australia, Canada, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Poland.\\nRead more on Hackers and cybercrime prevention\\nSandworm attacks Ukraine with Infamous Chisel malware\\nBy: Alex\\xa0Scroxton\\nGoogle: Russia continues to set cyber sights on NATO nations\\nBy: Alexander\\xa0Culafi\\nUK spent £6.4m on secret cyber package for Ukraine\\nBy: Alex\\xa0Scroxton\\nUkraine: Russian cyber attacks aimless and opportunistic\\nBy: Shaun\\xa0Nichols\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

Suzan DelBene of Washington State, the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, emphasized as she pointed to next year\\'s midterm elections during a Fox News Digital interview.Republicans are holding onto an extremely razor-thin majority in the chamber right now, and Democrats only need a three-seat pickup to win back the House majority in the 2026 elections.Additionally, they view the sweeping and controversial GOP-crafted measure stocked full of Trump\\'s second-term priorities on tax cuts, immigration, defense, energy and the debt limit – which is currently making its way through numerous votes and hurdles in the House – as political ammunition.INCHING CLOSER: HOUSE SPEAKER JOHNSON REACHES TENTATIVE AGREEMENT WITH SOME HOLDOUT GOP LAWMAKERS President Donald Trump, left, and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., talk with reporters after a House Republican Conference meeting on the budget reconciliation bill in the Capitol building on Tuesday, May 20, 2025. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\"This is a terrible piece of legislation,\" DelBene argued.Democrats from across the party are shining a spotlight on the Republicans\\' restructuring of Medicaid, the nearly 60-year-old federal government program that provides health insurance for roughly 71 million adults and children with limited incomes.\"Let’s be clear, all Republicans are talking about right now is how many people and how fast they’re going to take away healthcare. They have these huge cuts to Medicaid, 14 million people lose healthcare across the country, and they’re talking about how fast they can do that,\" DelBene charged on Tuesday.She claimed that House Republicans are \"all blindly following the president and going to blindly follow him off the cliff.\"Rep. Ted Lieu of California, another member of the House Democrat leadership, argued as he took questions from reporters that the bill \"has the largest cut to healthcare in U.S. history.\"GOP HOLDOUTS UNMOVED BY TRUMP\\'S \\'BIG, BEAUTIFUL\\' TRIP TO CAPITOL HILLThe cuts to Medicaid, being drafted in part as an offset to pay for extending Trump\\'s 2017 tax cut law, which is set to expire later this year, include a slew of new rules and regulatory requirements for those seeking coverage. Among them are a new set of work requirements for many of those seeking coverage.\"When you go across the country and talk to folks, folks are outraged, and they’re scared. They’re scared about the cuts to healthcare, not only cutting 14 million people off of healthcare but then raising costs beyond that for everyone and things like rural hospitals closing,\" DelBene argued. \"This would have devastating impacts across the country. This is policy that Republicans are fighting for, cutting nutrition health programs so that families don’t even have healthy food.\"House Republicans push back against the Democrats\\' attacks and say what they are doing is putting an end to waste, fraud and abuse currently in the Medicaid system, so the program can work for the public in the way that it was intended.They call any talk that they are cutting aid to mothers, children, people with disabilities and the elderly a \"flat out lie.\"FIRST ON FOX: THESE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS SAY THEY ‘STAND UNITED’ IN SUPPORT OF TRUMP\\'S ‘ONE BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’DelBene countered, saying, \"we’re not buying the argument because what we’ve seen in committee, what they’ve written down on paper is massive cuts in healthcare and all to pay for tax breaks for the wealthiest in our country. This isn’t a bill about helping working families. This bill is devastating for working families.\"However, her counterparty, Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, told Fox News Digital in a statement that \"Republicans are ending waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicaid so the most vulnerable get the care they need.\" Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, is interviewed by Fox News Digital on April 7, 2025 in Washington, D.C.

We’re strengthening Medicaid for future generations by protecting taxpayers and restoring integrity.\"CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPDating back to last year\\'s presidential campaign, Trump has vowed not to touch Medicaid. On Tuesday, as he made a rare stop on Capitol Hill to meet behind closed doors with House Republicans in order to shore up support for the bill, Trump\\'s message to fiscally conservative lawmakers looking to make further cuts to Medicaid was \"don\\'t f--- around with Medicaid.\"While there are divisions between Republicans over Medicaid, and a chasm between the two major parties over the longstanding entitlement program, there is one point of agreement – this issue will continue to simmer on the campaign trail in one form or another long after the legislative battles on Capitol Hill are over.

Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are still having trouble staying awake through their overnight sessions negotiating President Donald Trump\\'s \\'big beautiful bill.\\'In the middle of a session that spanned into the early hours of Wednesday morning, it was 71-year-old Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) who was caught on camera dozing off this time.The 1:00 a.m. vote on the multi-trillion-dollar bill includes $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, but is widely criticized by Democrats for gutting social programs like Medicaid and food assistance.Critics claim that Republicans are being bullied by Trump into holding the vote that\\'s forced members of Congress to stay in session overnight on more than one occasion.Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández (D-N.M.) tore into Norman in an X post exposing him for falling asleep around 2:15 a.m. during the consequential session. Rep. Ralph Norman is the latest victim to be caught on camera dozing off around 2:15 a.m. during an overnight congressional session for President Donald Trump\\'s \\'big beautiful bill\\' Rep.\\xa0James McGovern (D-MA) was also seen rubbing his eyes as he got sleeping during the latest overnight session from May 20-21 \\'Rep. Ralph Norman is ripping health care away from 13 million Americans not exciting enough to stay awake?\\' the 65-year-old congresswoman posted along with a video of Norman slipping into sleep.\\xa0Some on social media pointed to Norman\\'s age as the problem, claiming there needs to be limitations on how old a serving member of Congress can be.\\'We need mandatory retirement for ALL politicians in addition to term limits,\\' one user responded to the video. \\'It\\'s the only way to ensure relevant leadership at the top. The federal Congress and Senate shouldn\\'t be in the Nursing Home business.\\'But just a week prior during another overnight session, three other members were caught sleeping on the job – one who is relatively young compared to the average age of those serving in Congress.Utah Republican Rep. Blake Moore, 44, was among those who was taped dozing off during the bill markup overnight from May 13 to 14. A clip shows the lawmaker being gently shaken awake by a colleague after he missed a question during his nap.Other videos emerged that night showing 71-year-old Rep.

It\\'s not clear what other lawmakers were sleeping but not caught on camera, but the late night sessions are clearly weighing on several members – Democrat and Republican alike.\\'As a former lobbyist, I can tell you that sleeping on the job is one of the few things that Democrats and Republicans have in common,\\' one X user wrote when the latest video emerged on Wednesday morning.\\n```\\n\\n## [Analysis Shows Trump\\'s ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’ Would Take From Poor And Give To Rich](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/analysis-shows-trumps-big-beautiful-bill-would-take-from-poor-and-give-to-rich_uk_682d5e45e4b09b7e501338b8) (#33998)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 05:05:15+00:00\\n\\n```\\nThe big legislation Republicans are trying to pass this week would shrink economic resources for the poorest Americans while boosting the richest, according to a new analysis by Capitol Hill’s official budget scorekeeper.The Congressional Budget Office said on Tuesday the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, as it’s officially known, would shrink household resources for the lowest-income households by 2% in 2027 and 4% in 2033, mainly because of cuts to health and nutrition programsme. ”By contrast, resources would increase by an amount equal to 4 percent for households in the highest decile in 2027 and 2 percent in 2033, mainly because of reductions in… taxes they owe,” CBO director Phillip Swagel wrote in a letter to Democrats. Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries and Representative Brendan Boyle, the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee, requested the CBO analysis of the bill’s distributional effects for the top and bottom 10% of households by annual income. “This is what Republicans are fighting for – lining the pockets of their billionaire donors while children go hungry and families get kicked off their health care,” Boyle said in a statement. “CBO’s non-partisan analysis makes it crystal clear: Donald Trump and House Republicans are selling out the middle class to make the ultra-rich even richer.”Democrats have been hammering Republicans for the bill’s not-so-populist economic impacts for weeks; the CBO analysis distills the legislation’s reverse Robin Hood dynamic in dry and authoritative terms.

The CBO has previously estimated the legislation would shrink Medicaid enrollment by more than 7 million, including through increased eligibility checks and limits on benefits for people without jobs.A key House committee plans to vote on the bill in the early hours of Wednesday morning ahead of a possible final vote on its passage later this week, but it wasn’t clear as of Tuesday afternoon if enough Republicans will support the bill for it to pass with all Democrats opposed. House Speaker Mike Johnson has struggled to balance the demands of conservative Republicans who want steeper Medicaid cuts with blue-state moderates seeking bigger tax benefits for wealthy homeowners in their districts.President Donald Trump visited Capitol Hill on Tuesday morning to urge House Republicans to quit squabbling and pass the bill. Trump cautioned Republicans against overly aggressive Medicaid cuts and has previously suggested he would accept a “TINY” tax cut on the rich to help pay for the bill, but Republicans rejected the idea.

When he arrived on Capitol Hill, Mr. Trump suggested that any GOP member who doesn\\'t back what he and Republicans have deemed the \"big, beautiful bill\" would be \"knocked out so fast,\" a warning to a handful of \"grandstanders.\"\\xa0\"It\\'s the biggest bill ever passed, and we\\'ve got to get it done,\" Mr. Trump said.House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, can only afford three defections in a floor vote, if all members are present and voting, given his slim majority. All Democrats are expected to oppose it.\\xa0\"I would say that if the vote were held right now, it dies a painful death,\" Republican Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee said Tuesday evening. He told reporters he would vote \"no\" on the package in its current form.\\xa0But before a floor vote, the legislation will have to make it through the Rules Committee, the last stop for most legislation before the full House\\xa0votes on a measure. The committee began meeting shortly after 1 a.m., and was still meeting as the sun rose on Wednesday.\\xa0President Trump arrives with Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) for a House Republican meeting at the U.S. Capitol on May 20, 2025 in Washington, DC.\\nKevin Dietsch / Getty Images\\n\"If you guys think this ugly bill is so damn beautiful, like Trump keeps saying, you should have the courage to debate it in primetime,\" Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Rules Committee, said at the start of the meeting.\\nRepublicans, however, rejected the request to adjourn the meeting until daylight hours. And the committee\\'s chairwoman, Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, said the Rules Committee \"has a long tradition of meeting late into the evening and reporting legislation long after most of America has gone to bed.\"The committee\\'s rare overnight meeting took place as Republican leadership races to pass the budget package before its self-imposed Memorial Day deadline.\\xa0Johnson has been meeting with the different factions in recent days to hear the demands and build a consensus around a modified version of the legislation that was produced by nearly a dozen House committees.\\xa0Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) (C) talks to Rep. Joe Neguse (D-CO) (L) and Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D-PA) during a House Rules Committee meeting on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act at the U.S. Capitol on May 21, 2025.\\nKevin Dietsch / Getty Images\\nConservatives, who are upset that that bill does not make steep enough spending cuts to significantly bring down the deficit, have pushed for Medicaid work requirements to kick in much sooner than a 2029 deadline. They also want to eliminate all the clean energy subsidies that were implemented under the Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law by former President Joe Biden.\\nAfter right-wing opposition appeared to remain firm overnight, Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told reporters Wednesday that the White House offered a proposal that would enable these holdouts to back the budget bill, if it were to be included in the package.\\xa0\"I don\\'t think it can be done today,\" Harris said. \"I think that there is a pathway forward that we can see.\"The conservative holdouts did not offer details on the proposal they said the White House has offered. But the caucus was set to meet with President Trump Wednesday afternoon, accompanied by Speaker Johnson, CBS News confirmed. \\xa0Conservatives have also been pushing to change the rate by which the federal government pays states for Medicaid, a point of contention with moderates, who have warned against larger cuts to the program.\\xa0Johnson reiterated earlier this week that the change has \"been off the table for quite some time,\" however. And Mr. Trump said ahead of the meeting Tuesday morning that \"we\\'re not doing anything cutting of anything meaningful,\" adding that on Medicaid, \"the only thing we\\'re cutting is waste, fraud and abuse.\"\\nThough a manager\\'s amendment, which will include the changes negotiated to the package in recent days, has yet to be released, the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that the original version of the bill would add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. And a new preliminary analysis from the Congressional Budget Office found it would increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion.\\xa0Right-wing Republicans aren\\'t the only ones with objections to the legislation, though. Blue-state Republicans oppose a provision on the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, and they have threatened to withhold their votes unless their demands are met.\\xa0Prior to the SALT deduction cap, which was imposed by the 2017 Trump tax law, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits\\xa0wealthy homeowners\\xa0in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But others also point out that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.Republicans who represent blue states have pushed for an increase to the SALT cap, but balked at the $30,000 cap outlined in the package because they think that\\'s still too low.GOP Rep. Mike Lawler of New York said ahead of the meeting with the president that the group of moderates had no plans to cave. And on his message to conservatives, Lawler told reporters, \"if they think we\\'re going to throw our constituents under the bus to appease them, it\\'s not happening.\"\\n\"The fact is, we wouldn\\'t even be in this position right now if you didn\\'t have members in seats like mine who won,\" Lawler said.\\xa0Mr. Trump also weighed in on the SALT issue, suggesting that he opposes raising the cap because he claimed Democratic governors from states like New York, Illinois and California would benefit, calling them the \"biggest\" beneficiaries. But after the group of moderates met with the speaker Tuesday evening, Johnson indicated that they had \"found a point of compromise.\"According to a senior White House official, Mr. Trump told the House GOP conference during the meeting that they should not let division over the SALT cap get in the way of the bill, and said they should not touch Medicaid, except for addressing waste, fraud and abuse, along with cutting benefits for noncitizens and imposing work requirements. The official said Mr. Trump also made clear he wants every Republican to vote \"yes\" on the bill, while saying he\\'s losing patience with the remaining holdouts.\\xa0Johnson said at a news conference following the meeting that leadership would work to \"gather up the small subgroups in the House Republican conference and tie up the remaining loose ends.\"\"We are going to get this done,\" the speaker added.\\nCaitlin Yilek\\nCaitlin Yilek is a politics reporter at CBSNews.com, based in Washington, D.C.

Because they wouldn\\'t be a Republican much longer. They would get - they would be knocked out so fast.STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: House Speaker Mike Johnson wants a vote as soon as today, but as always, he needs almost every Republican on his side in order to pass it.FADEL: NPR\\'s Deirdre Walsh is at the Capitol, and she joins me now. Good morning, Deirdre.DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Good morning, Leila.FADEL: So did Trump\\'s pep rally with House Republicans build the support he needs for that bill?WALSH: He did sway some who praised his sales job, but the president failed to convince a significant bloc of Republican holdouts. There are moderates who represent districts with high state and local taxes who want a bigger tax break for their constituents. There are conservatives worried about ballooning deficits and say this bill does not go far enough to slash spending and deal with the deficit. The speaker spent the day and overnight hours trying to negotiate with these factions. And remember, he can only lose three votes, and we already know one member, Tom Massie of Kentucky, is a hard no.FADEL: OK, so did leaders agree to any of these demands to move some of these holdouts?WALSH: Potentially. Overnight, a key committee met to set the parameters to start debate on the House floor, and that panel is still meeting. The speaker said when they started around 1 a.m., they were close to a deal, but we haven\\'t seen any details yet. Leaders are expected to increase the amount of that state and local tax deduction to address the concerns of some moderates they need. Conservatives say there\\'s been some progress on more savings. But, Leila, it\\'s like Whac-A-Mole, you agree to one change from one group, and it could mean losing support from another group.FADEL: So, Deirdre, talk about the major components in the bill and what their impact would be.WALSH: So the tax cuts are really the central plank in the bill. The bill permanently extends the 2017 tax cuts that are going to expire at the end of December. It adds new tax breaks like no tax on overtime, no tax on tips, things that Trump campaigned on. Those tax breaks expire in four years after Trump leaves office. The bill has roughly 1 1/2 trillion in spending cuts, and a big chunk of those come from changes to Medicaid. That\\'s the healthcare program for elderly, low-income, and disabled. It adds work requirements for adults without dependence on Medicaid. It changes eligibility rules that can mean people end up getting removed from the roles.Trump said during his visit to the Capitol there wouldn\\'t be any cuts, and the measure is focused on cutting waste, fraud and abuse. But the Congressional Budget Office found that at least 8.6 million people could lose healthcare coverage due to these changes. A CBO analysis that came out late last night found out that the poorest, the bottom 10% of Americans, would see their household resources drop due to the policy and tax changes in this package, while the top 10% would get a bump in income. And we should also note that the bill makes cuts to food assistance programs, and that could impact millions of children who rely on that program for school lunches.FADEL: So if this bill gets through the House, what are the prospects in the Senate?WALSH: I mean, there are going to be changes in the Senate. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Senate Republicans want to see further spending cuts to reduce the deficit. Other Republicans in the Senate are critical of the Medicaid changes in this House package, and the Treasury Department is going to run out of money to pay its bills this summer. So lawmakers included a $4 trillion increase in the debt ceiling to avoid a default. But for right now, House Republican leaders are still negotiating to try to get the votes to get it through the House.FADEL: That\\'s NPR\\'s Deirdre Walsh. Thank you, Deirdre.WALSH: Thanks, Leila.\\nCopyright © 2025 NPR. All rights reserved.

NPR\\'s Leila Fadel speaks with Democratic Representative Greg Casar of Texas.\\nLEILA FADEL, HOST: Lawmakers have been up all night debating President Trump\\'s massive budget bill. Democrats are hoping to slow down Republican efforts to pass the budget that would allow them to implement much of Trump\\'s agenda. Democratic Congressman Greg Casar of Texas joins me now to talk about this.Good morning, and thank you for being on the program.GREG CASAR: Good morning.FADEL: So what are your major objections to this bill?CASAR: Right now, we aren\\'t just fighting over what\\'s in the bill but whether the American people get to know what\\'s in this bill. Republican members of Congress are trying to ram this through with no scrutiny. They started their hearing this morning at 1 in the morning under the cover of darkness. They\\'re lying about what\\'s in it because they don\\'t want the American people to know all the objectionable things in this bill. The Republicans know that taking food assistance away from working-class kids to pay for tax cuts for billionaires is deeply unpopular. They know that passing the biggest Medicaid cut in American history is deeply unpopular and dangerous. And the latest news from overnight is that their bill will also trigger the biggest Medicare cuts in American history.So your question to me is what\\'s objectionable in the bill? Virtually everything in this bill is all about making life worse and more expensive for your average person while making things better just for the richest people in the country. So our job is to expose this bill, bring it into the sunlight. And that\\'s why Democrats have been there all night asking questions with more and more Democrats showing up to drag this out into the morning so that there can be some sunlight on this horrible bill.FADEL: So you\\'re saying they\\'re lying about the impacts it would have on food benefits, Medicaid, things like that?CASAR: You hear the Republican members of Congress on TV do this all the time. They go and say, well, you know, these big Medicaid cuts, and then they catch themselves and say, oh, I mean Medicaid reforms. What they\\'re really talking about - take all of their double speak away. What they\\'re talking about is closing rural hospitals. Closing addiction treatment centers. Leaving 4 million school-age kids without food assistance. It\\'s horrible, but we can still stop it. Remember just eight years ago, when they were going to, you know, end Obamacare, you had Trump in the White House, Republicans in control of the House and Senate. But then the American people marched. They called. They demanded better. The Republican majority is very slim. And if there\\'s enough public pressure and Democrats make sure that the American people know what is actually going on here, then we can stop this horrible bill.FADEL: Now, the Republicans argue that really, spending is out of control. There have to be cuts here. I mean, without a majority in the House, what impact can Democrats have on the budget process? I mean, is the strategy just to publicly speak about it?CASAR: We have to do more than just speak about it here in Washington, D.C. That\\'s why I, a progressive Democrat from Central Texas, recently flew to Colorado and went and spoke in Colorado\\'s 8th Congressional District represented by a Republican - a Republican who refuses to have town halls with his own constituents. And there were nurses that came and asked questions that they wanted to ask of their Republican member of Congress that came and got to talk to me about why is it that Republicans are trying to close their hospitals, cut their health care? There were everyday people coming and saying, I need a tax cut a lot more than Elon Musk needs a tax break.And so we can go and actually speak to everyday voters - conservative, independent, Democratic alike - and make the case because the Republican majority is extremely slim. They\\'re having a lot of trouble passing this bill. And to your question about if spending is out of control, look, the Republican plan here actually doesn\\'t reduce this deficit, it blows it up. The Republican plan, ultimately, is about tax cuts for billionaires and then cutting health care and other essential services for the American people. This isn\\'t the kind of bill that\\'s popular with Republican voters. This is the bill that only really helps the richest Republican donors and leaves all of the voters behind.FADEL: Representative Greg Casar of Texas, thank you for your time.CASAR: Thank you very much.(SOUNDBITE OF ALL THEM WITCHES\\' \"INSTRUMENTAL 2\")\\nCopyright © 2025 NPR.

Members of the committee met starting at 1 a.m. ET Wednesday and adjourned around 10:40 p.m. ET before they voted for the legislation along party lines, 8-4. The vote came shortly after Republicans released a set of revisions to their massive bill, a product of last-minute negotiations to placate various factions of the party, including conservative hard-liners and blue-state Republicans, that were threatening to sink the measure. The 42-page amendment to the multitrillion-dollar legislation includes moving up the enforcement of work requirements for eligible Medicaid recipients by two years, to the end of 2026, phasing out clean energy tax credits earlier and expanding the federal deduction for state and local taxes to $40,000 for people earning less than $500,000 annually. It\\'s unclear exactly when the House will take up the package for a vote. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., navigating a narrow three-seat majority in the chamber, had said he hoped to hold the vote Wednesday night or Thursday morning.Here are some of the biggest changes GOP leaders made to Trump\\'s \"big, beautiful bill\" Wednesday. Medicaid changesIn a win for conservative hard-liners in the House Freedom Caucus, the agreement speeds up the timeline when work requirements would kick in for able-bodied adults ages 18 to 64 to be able to receive Medicaid benefits. The original legislation, adopted by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, called for work requirements to start at the beginning of 2029. But anti-spending hawks, led by Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris, R-Md., pushed to have them begin \"not later than Dec. 31, 2026,\" so savings would take effect sooner.The new language would also allow states to move the date to earlier if they chose to do so.Shifting the start date sooner would mean millions of people could lose Medicaid benefits before the 2028 presidential election, and some could possibly lose them before the 2026 midterm election. That could be a political liability for Republicans up and down the ballot, though Trump and congressional GOP leaders say they are simply rooting out \"fraud, waste and abuse.\"In another significant shift, states that declined the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act would get higher payments as an incentive to encourage them not to expand the program.Clean energy creditsThe Freedom Caucus notched another victory in its eleventh-hour negotiations: more quickly phasing out clean energy tax breaks from former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.The measure would cut off production and investment tax credits for any facility if the construction began 60 days after the bill was enacted, or after 2028.The revised bill would also unwind credits for wind and solar leasing arrangements for properties.“We worked with the White House to get some important revisions to expedite the phase out,” Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., told reporters. “Look, President Trump doesn’t want these, either, and so we worked with them to get really tight language to limit dramatically any new projects from starting.”Boosting the SALT capRepublicans who represent districts in high-tax blue states said their top priority in the package was raising the SALT cap, the amount federal taxpayers can deduct in state and local taxes.The original legislation, passed out of the Ways and Means Committee, hiked the SALT cap to $30,000, up from the current $10,000 cap imposed in Trump\\'s 2017 tax cut law. But members of the SALT Caucus slammed that increase as insufficient. The new bill would boost the SALT cap to $40,000 for people making less than $500,000 a year. Both the cap and the income level would increase by 1% annually for 10 years.\"This is the No. 1 federal issue for my constituents. If I do a bad deal, I would expect my constituents to throw me out. If I did a deal at $30,000, my own mother wouldn\\'t vote for me,\" Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., said this week in the middle of the negotiations. \"Now is the time to make it right what we got wrong in 2017; now is the time to deliver on promises that we\\'ve made,\" he added. \\'MAGA Accounts\\' renamed to \\'Trump Accounts\\'In a more trivial change to the bill, Republicans are renaming their tax-preferred savings accounts that parents could set up for children\\xa0from \"MAGA Accounts\" to \"Trump Accounts.\"The first line of the manager\\'s amendment reads, \"Page 10, in the item relating to section 110115, strike \\'MAGA\\' and insert \\'Trump\\'.\"Sahil KapurSahil Kapur is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.Scott WongScott Wong is a senior congressional reporter for NBC News.

HFC leadership suggested Wednesday, following a meeting with House Speaker Mike Johnson, that they will not support advancing the president’s sweeping tax and spending package if the Speaker were to bring it to the floor later on Wednesday. The conservative House Republicans emphasized that while they want to see Trump’s legislative agenda passed as quickly as possible, they argued the legislation is not ready to be voted on and it could take as many as 10 days to come to an agreement over several issues affecting their support for the package, including reforms to Medicaid and eliminating green energy tax breaks. (RELATED: ‘Got Worse Overnight’: Freedom Caucus Chair Says There’s ‘No Way’ Trump’s ‘Beautiful Bill’ Will Pass Immediately)“I don’t think it can be done today,” HFC chairman Andy Harris told reporters Wednesday at an impromptu press conference. “The runway is short today. The leadership is going to have to figure out where to go from here.” “But I think progress is made,” Harris continued. “I think that there is a pathway forward that we can see. But again, the leadership will\\xa0have to figure out what the timeframe of this is … I’m not sure this could be done this week. I’m pretty confident it could be done in 10 days.” HFC members said they are negotiating with the White House on a deal to get on board with the budget reconciliation bill. The caucus is scheduled to meet with Trump at the White House to discuss particulars of the bill. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Andy Harris doesn’t think a vote on the BBB will happen this week but is “confident” it could be done in 10 days. “We just want to emphasize, we want to deliver the President’s agenda,” Harris said. HFC meets at WH @ 3pm today@DailyCaller — Andi Shae Napier (@AndiNapier) May 21, 2025 HFC leadership’s request to delay a vote comes as Johnson is attempting to pass the budget reconciliation bill as early as Wednesday afternoon to meet his deadline of Memorial Day to send the package to the Senate. Trump has also urged House Republicans to fall in line and pass the legislation immediately during his meeting with the conference Tuesday morning. The debate is in part over the House Freedom Caucus’ belief that they are honoring the president’s America First agenda by pursuing more aggressive spending cuts in the budget bill. Republican Texas Rep. Chip Roy, who has demanded additional reforms to Medicaid and green energy tax breaks, echoed Harris’ comments that House Republicans have a “long way to go” to strike a deal. “I want to be very clear, we’ve got to deliver on what we’re talking about, or we’re not going to be able to get the bill done, and that’s what we’re trying to achieve,” Roy said. “When the President said ‘End the Green New Scam,’ he didn’t mean leave 40 to 45 to 50% of the subsidies ongoing,” Trump notably called for a full repeal of former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act while on the campaign trail. He has been quiet on the fate of the legislation since starting his second term. The president also reportedly told House Republicans not to “fuck around with Medicaid” during a closed-door meeting with the conference Tuesday. Republican Pennsylvania Rep. Scott Perry argued Johnson’s deadline to pass Trump’s agenda was “arbitrary.” “If today comes and goes it doesn’t mean that this possibility to make sure that taxes stay low and that we fix America’s healthcare system and fix America’s energy system — it doesn’t mean that prospect is off the table,” Perry said. “It just means it might not happen today. It’s important that everybody knows that, because there’s some kind of belief in Washington DC, that once today comes and goes, that this cannot be fixed. “This is a completely arbitrary deadline set by people here to force people into a corner to make bad decisions,” Perry continued. “It’s more important to get this right, to get it correct, than to get it fixed.” WASHINGTON, DC – MAY 20: House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) speaks to reporters as he arrives for a House Republican meeting at the U.S. Capitol on May 20, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) House GOP leadership has made it clear that Republicans who break with the party during a vote on the House floor will be subject to withering criticism. “Do you really want to be in the same category on this bill: raising taxes, saying ‘no’ to American energy, opening up the border, letting the criminal gang members who came to this country illegally stay in America,” House Majority Leader Steve Scalise told Fox News’ Guy Benson on Tuesday at an event hosted by Americans for Prosperity. “And I can tell you who is voting no: [Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez] AOC, [Former Speaker] Nancy Pelosi, [Democratic Michigan Rep. Rashida] Tlaib, [Democratic Minnesota Rep. Ilhan] Omar, [Democratic Texas Rep. Jasmine] Crockett. You want me to continue going on? Do you want to be in that list? Because that’s the list you’re going to be in if you vote ‘no.\\'” “We are always on a tight margin right now in the House,” Scalise said Tuesday. “We’ve got to get it done. We’re not going to stop until we get it done.” The House Rules Committee, which gaveled in at 1 a.m. Wednesday morning to advance the president’s “big, beautiful” bill was still debating the legislation as of this writing. Roy, who sits on the influential committee, has not committed thus far to advancing the package. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has disputed the assertion that the deadline to pass Trump’s agenda is “arbitrary,” citing the need to quickly address the debt limit. Bessent\\xa0sent\\xa0Johnson a letter on May 9, stating that Congress must increase the debt limit by mid-July to avoid the government defaulting on its debt. “Prior episodes have shown that waiting until the last minute to suspend or increase the debt limit can have serious adverse consequences for financial markets, businesses, and the federal government, harm business and consumer confidence and raise short-term borrowing costs for taxpayers,” Bessent wrote. The president’s budget reconciliation bill under consideration in the House notably includes a provision to raise the country’s debt ceiling by $4 trillion.

The deduction was created in 1913 when the federal income tax was established. The idea was to prevent double taxation.\\nAs part of the 2017 Trump tax cuts, Republicans capped the SALT deduction at $10,000 to help pay for the broader tax breaks.\\nThe original version of the bill would have tripled the cap to $30,000 for most taxpayers and added an income limit so the deduction is reduced further for anyone earning above $400,000. The blue-state Republicans said that did not go far enough.\\nSEE ALSO: House passes Trump agenda bill, sending massive tax and spending cut package to the Senate\\nThe updated version would quadruple the existing cap to $40,000 for most taxpayers, with a $500,000 income limit before the amount is reduced.\\nMarried couples filing separate returns would be subject to a cap of $20,000 each, with individual $250,000 income limits.\\nThe caps and income limits increase by 1% annually over 10 years, a more cost-controlled effort to guard against inflation.\\nConservatives also secured a few of their requests in the bill, although GOP leaders shot down some of the most significant changes hardliners in the House Freedom Caucus wanted on Medicaid and clean-energy tax credits.\\nStill, the update does include one of their demands, speeding up the implementation of work requirements for able-bodied adults on Medicaid from Jan. 1, 2029 to Dec. 31, 2026. It would also allow states to begin implementation sooner, if they choose.\\nIt would also move up the phase-out schedules for various clean energy tax credits, although not as aggressively as Freedom Caucus members had sought.\\nConservatives also secured changes deregulating firearm suppressors by removing them from the national registry and eliminating taxes on their production. The original bill only eliminated taxes on the transfer of silencers.\\nThe update would ban Medicaid dollars for being used on gender-transition therapies or procedures for adults, in addition to the ban for minors included in the original version.\\nOne of the most substantive additions is $12 billion added for the Homeland Security Department to provide grants to states for costs associated with enforcing federal immigration laws and supporting “federal border security missions” since the beginning of the Biden administration.\\nTexas has requested the federal government reimburse the state for $11 billion in costs spent on Operation Lone Star, which Gov. Greg Abbott launched because, he said, the Biden administration wasn’t taking enough action to secure the border.\\nIn the section of the bill that raises federal employees’ contributions to their retirements, the update strikes a provision that would have based a retiree’s annuity payment on their average highest five earning years instead of highest three.\\nSome changes to the bill are more stylistic than substantive, like a renaming of a new savings account to encourage families to save for their children’s future expenses like higher education, job training and first-time home purchases.\\nThe original bill called them “MAGA” (Money Accounts for Growth and Advancement) savings accounts, while the update makes the intention even more obvious, renaming them “Trump” accounts.\\n```\\n\\n## [House GOP leaders forge on with plans for late Wednesday or early Thursday vote on Trump agenda bill](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/may/21/house-gop-leaders-forge-plans-late-wednesday-early-thursday-vote/) (#41039)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 23:06:01+00:00\\n\\n```\\nHouse Republican leaders vowed to bring President Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” to the floor late Wednesday or early Thursday, after shutting down a push from the House Freedom Caucus to secure more changes.\\nThe decision to forge ahead came after a meeting with President Trump at the White House.\\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, Louisiana Republican, and his leadership team attended, along with several Freedom Caucus members.\\n“There’s not much changing here, because the underlying product we thought was so well done,” Mr. Johnson told reporters after returning to the Capitol.\\nThe Freedom Caucus members had said earlier Wednesday that they would not support the bill unless they secured further changes to reduce federal spending on Medicaid for able-bodied adults and speed up the repeal of clean energy tax credits.\\nUltimately, GOP leaders, with input from the president, decided the hard-line conservatives’ demands couldn’t be accommodated without losing other GOP votes.\\n“Obviously, they brought up some of the items that they’re still trying to get added, but we talked about the political dynamics and the realities of the members in our conference who aren’t for those things,” said House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, Louisiana Republican.\\nMr. Scalise said GOP leaders have had to maintain “a very delicate balance” to ensure both moderates and conservatives in the conference will support the bill. He said he was “very confident” that it would pass the House.\\n“In the end, I don’t know how many ‘no’ votes it will be, because some people say no and then they vote yes,” Mr. Scalise said.\\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president reiterated during the meeting “how critical it is for the country to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill as quickly as possible.”\\n“The meeting was productive and moved the ball in the right direction,” she said.\\nHoldout House Freedom Caucus members, huddling back at the Capitol after the White House meeting, were mum about whether they would vote for the bill. The few who would speak to reporters cited “progress” made over the course of the day but did not elaborate.\\n“One way or another, we’re moving in the direction that we were wanting to go,” said Rep. Eric Burlison, Missouri Republican, calling Mr. Trump “the maestro of the deal.”\\nMr. Johnson had said that Freedom Caucus’ concerns could be resolved outside of the “big, beautiful bill.”\\n“It’ll probably be some combination of work by the president in these areas, as well as here in Congress,” he said. “There may be executive orders related to some of these issues in the near future.”\\nMr. Johnson did not elaborate on what potential executive orders may entail, but they would most likely face challenges for attempting to circumvent Congress.\\nThe speaker said a manager’s amendment to the bill containing “minor” changes agreed to earlier in negotiations would be sent later Wednesday to the Rules Committee, which has been meeting on the bill since 1 a.m.\\nMr. Scalise said the manager’s amendment will move up the implementation date for Medicaid work requirements, which were not set to kick in until 2029 under the original version of the bill.\\nThe amendment will also make some previously agreed-upon changes that accelerate the phaseout of clean energy tax credits, although those do not go as far as the Freedom Caucus wanted.\\nMr. Scalise said there will not be further changes to Medicaid provider taxes, which Freedom Caucus members have likened to a “money-laundering scam.”\\nStates use taxes on hospitals and other health care providers to finance their share of Medicaid. But some states use the tax revenue to increase Medicaid payments to the same providers, which then inflates the total cost of their Medicaid programs and the share the federal government must contribute.\\nThe bill freezes states’ provider taxes at their current rates and prohibits them from establishing new provider taxes, but the Freedom Caucus wanted to eliminate the provider taxes for states that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare to cover more able-bodied adults.\\nOnce the Rules Committee approves the manager’s amendment and the rule with terms for debating the bill, the full House can begin its debate, voting first on the rule and, if that test vote succeeds, the final bill.\\n“We’ll decide whether the vote will be tonight — passage of the rule, followed by final passage on the bill — or tomorrow morning,” Mr. Johnson said. “And we’re excited. I believe we are going to land this airplane.”\\n```\\n\\n## [Debt hawks spar with blue-state Republicans over tentative SALT deal](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/may/21/debt-hawks-spar-blue-state-republicans-tentative-salt-deal/) (#41042)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 19:12:42+00:00\\n\\n```\\nA tentative deal to quadruple the existing $10,000 cap on the federal deduction for state and local taxes, or SALT, is irritating conservatives who are seeking steeper spending cuts in Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill.”\\nThe SALT deal brokered between GOP leaders and blue-state Republicans who wanted to lift the cap comes as House Republicans are trying to wrangle enough votes to pass the massive budget reconciliation package carrying President Trump’s agenda.\\nThe proposal calls for raising the SALT cap to $40,000 for taxpayers earning up to $500,000 a year with gradual annual 1% increases to both figures.\\nThe agreement is tentative until GOP leaders finalize other aspects of the bill.\\nFiscal hawks are upset that GOP leaders would agree to raise the SALT cap without offsetting spending cuts.\\n“Writing a deficit-backed blank check (SALT) is easier than cutting spending (DOGE, Green New Scam, Post-COVID spending),” Rep Chip Roy, Texas Republican, said on X. “Congress/swamp will always choose the easy route but we can’t afford it.”\\nMr. Roy and other members of the House Freedom Caucus are opposed to the budget reconciliation package because they do not believe it goes far enough to reduce federal spending on Medicaid for able-bodied adults or act fast enough to repeal clean energy tax credits.\\nHouse Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris, Maryland Republican, said the SALT deal moves the bill in the wrong direction as GOP leaders promised the measure would be deficit-neutral after factoring in economic growth.\\n“We need to move the amount of cuts up because, goodness knows, we moved the amount of spending yesterday with the SALT agreement,” he said.\\nThe SALT deal is estimated to cost around $350 billion over 10 years.\\n“Imagine if Congress chose inspirational policy to lead America rather than buying a handful of seats with $350 billion in parochial tax subsidies in the form of SALT — while giving 7 times MORE money to the able-bodied than vulnerable Americans on Medicaid wait-lists,” Mr. Roy said in another X post.\\nBlue-state Republicans who negotiated for the higher SALT cap are defending the agreement against the conservative backlash.\\n“In high tax states and districts, the reality is the cost of living is extremely high and the cap unfairly hurts the middle class and working class,” Rep. Mike Lawler, New York Republican on X. “This is not about the rich, but those families that need critical tax relief.”\\nMr. Lawler was responding to a quote from Rep. Keith Self, Texas Republican, posted by a Fox News reporter.\\n“It’s very dangerous because it’s throwing money to get votes in the Republican conference,” Mr. Self said, noting Republicans should be cutting taxes and spending to put more money in taxpayers’ pockets.\\nThe SALT proposal “does not do it except for the wealthy donors in the three or four big states,” he said, referring to California, New York and New Jersey. “It’s just a fact that people making over $200,000 a year are the primary beneficiaries of SALT.”\\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, citing his three-vote cushion, said he is meeting with various Republicans on their concerns and trying “to meet the equilibrium point” on the budget reconciliation package.\\n“Sometimes it goes slower than most of us want, but that’s how the founders designed this,” he said.\\nThe speaker would not say whether a Wednesday night vote, as he originally targeted, is off the table, but said he is still aiming to pass the bill this week.\\n“We’ve been saying this for many months that we would do it before Memorial Day, and I intend to hold the schedule,” he said.\\nPro-SALT Republicans were not only feuding with conservatives in their party but with Democrats who said they accepted a weak deal.\\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, accused his home state Republicans of bowing to Mr. Trump’s change in position on fully getting rid of the SALT cap.\\n“Are they going to continue to stand up, are they going to show some spine, or are they just going to wither in the face of what Donald Trump said and desert millions of their constituents?” he said.\\nRep.

Cuomo over pandemic testimony: AP](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/justice-dept-investigating-former-new-york-gov-cuomo-122015540) (#30531)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 03:31:20+00:00\\n\\n```\\nWASHINGTON -- The Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo after congressional Republicans recommended that he be charged with lying over his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, a person familiar with the matter said Tuesday.The investigation by the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington follows a referral from Rep. James Comer, Republican chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, over statements Cuomo made to lawmakers investigating his management of the pandemic when the virus was spreading through nursing homes, the person said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss an ongoing investigation.The investigation plunges the Justice Department yet again into New York politics as Cuomo runs for New York City mayor. It comes just months after federal prosecutors abandoned a corruption case against New York Mayor Eric Adams — Cuomo’s opponent in the mayoral race — citing a desire to free Adams up to cooperate with the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.A spokesperson for Cuomo said Tuesday that the former governor was never informed of any such investigation.“So why would someone leak it now? The answer is obvious: This is lawfare and election interference plain and simple — something President Trump and his top Department of Justice officials say they are against,” Cuomo spokesperson Rich Azzopardi said in an email.Azzopardi added, “Governor Cuomo testified truthfully to the best of his recollection about events from four years earlier, and he offered to address any follow-up questions from the Subcommittee — but from the beginning this was all transparently political.”The investigation was first reported Tuesday by The New York Times. The Justice Department declined Tuesday to comment. Spokespeople for the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington didn’t immediately respond to messages seeking comment. The inquiry also subjects the department to claims that it is pursuing retribution against political adversaries. The new leader of the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington, Jeanine Pirro, ran unsuccessfully against Cuomo for New York attorney general in 2006 and has been a harsh critic in the years since, publicly accusing him of a coverup of nursing home deaths. The Justice Department separately has launched a mortgage fraud investigation into New York Attorney General Letitia James, who sued Trump for civil fraud.The investigation into Cuomo revisits a years-old, politically divisive question over the then-governor’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in nursing homes. Republicans have zeroed in on a controversial directive his administration issued in March 2020 that initially barred nursing homes from refusing to accept patients just because they had had COVID-19. More than 9,000 recovering coronavirus patients were released from hospitals into nursing homes under the directive, which was rescinded amid speculation that it had accelerated outbreaks.Comer referred Cuomo to the Justice Department for possible criminal prosecution last month, alleging that he made false statements to lawmakers during a hearing last year focused on his decision-making.Cuomo adamantly defended himself during the hearing, blaming the earlier Trump administration for failing to provide enough testing and personal protective equipment in the early days of the pandemic. “These are all diversions to blame New York and other states for the culpability of the federal response, which was malpractice,” Cuomo said.But Comer asserted that Cuomo had lied during the hearing. He cited what he said was evidence of Cuomo’s direct involvement in a state report that the congressman said “low-balled” nursing home fatalities.\\n```\\n\\n## [Justice Department is investigating whether ex-NY Gov.

But Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown little desire for any sort of ceasefire and he’s more than happy to keep delaying any definite decisions.\\xa0So, maybe predictably, the phone call this week between the two presidents didn’t achieve great strides on reaching a ceasefire deal. However, one thing was clear by the end of their conversation: The bromance is real.\\xa0This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.“The tone and spirit of the conversation were excellent,” Trump said of his two-hour conversation, adding that Putin is a “nice gentleman.” Putin adviser Yuri Ushakov, meanwhile, said Trump and Putin called each other by their first names and “neither of them wanted to end the conversation.”\\xa0But a question lingers: What does this bonhomie actually deliver for the men in the White House and the Kremlin?For Putin, it’s time. If the Russian leader’s call with Trump delays making any decisions, then “I think Putin will see it as a good job done,” one expert said. But if an in-person meeting between Putin and Trump takes place, “then Trump will have to leave with something.”Read the full story here.More politics news:A federal judge told the Trump administration\\xa0to “maintain custody and control”\\xa0of a group of immigrants it’s trying to deport to war-torn South Sudan.Trump\\xa0will host South African President Cyril Ramaphosa\\xa0at the White House today in an effort to improve relations between the two countries.In a surprise move, the Senate\\xa0passed the “No Tax on Tips Act,”\\xa0which would create a new tax deduction worth up to $25,000 for cash tips.

The mandate comes before tomorrow’s FDA vaccine advisory committee meeting where outside experts will discuss which strains should be included in the next round of Covid shots.In a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine, FDA commissioner Dr. Marty Makary and Dr. Vinay Prasad, the agency’s new vaccine chief, wrote that any new Covid vaccine now must undergo placebo-controlled clinical trials and track participants for at least six months. That means it’ll be near impossible for Pfizer and Moderna to complete new trials in time for the fall season. In a question-and-answer session, Makary and Prasad also suggested that the vaccines may not be updated every year.\\xa0The rule changes aren’t expected to affect the fall rollout for older adults and other people at high risk for severe illness because drugmakers are exempt from additional testing for those groups.\\xa0Here’s what else to know.Read All About It\\u200aActor George Wendt, who once played the ever-loyal Norm on “Cheers,”\\xa0has died at the age of 76.Two students at University of Wisconsin-Platteville\\xa0died after a “targeted and isolated” shooting\\xa0on campus, officials said.Columbia University’s acting president\\xa0was met with boos\\xa0and chants of “Free Mahmoud” at yesterday’s graduation ceremony.A friend of the 20-year-old man who fell from the stands onto the field during a Pittsburgh Pirates game was\\xa0charged with giving him alcohol.In a major step for the NFL, owners voted to\\xa0allow players to participate in the 2028 Olympics.Buy now, pay never?

Let’s be clear: lying to Congress is a federal crime. Mr Cuomo must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”He went on to say: “The House oversight committee is prepared to fully cooperate with the justice department’s investigation into Andrew Cuomo’s actions and ensure he’s held to account.”In response to the reports, a Cuomo spokesperson, Rich Azzopardi, said: “We have never been informed of any such matter, so why would someone leak it now? The answer is obvious: this is lawfare and election interference plain and simple – something President Trump and his top Department of Justice officials say they are against.“Governor Cuomo testified truthfully to the best of his recollection about events from four years earlier, and he offered to address any follow-up questions from the subcommittee – but from the beginning this was all transparently political,” Azzopardi added.The US attorney’s office, which was previously led by Ed Martin, is now headed by Jeanine Pirro, a former Fox News host and prosecutor. Pirro was appointed by Trump after Martin’s nomination to permanently run the office was withdrawn following Senate Republicans’ concern over his ability to serve, the New York Times reported.Despite his frontrunner status in the mayoral race, Cuomo has been an embattled figure in politics in recent years. He resigned as governor in 2021 after an investigation by the state attorney general, Letitia James, which found that he sexually harassed multiple women and retaliated against those who made complaints.Shortly after Cuomo announced his decision to run for New York City mayor in March, the justice department dropped its corruption case against the city’s current mayor, Eric Adams. Adams pleaded not guilty to accepting bribes and illegal campaign contributions from Turkish officials in exchange for favors.The apparent investigation into Cuomo comes as Adams, a Democrat who announced his intention to run for re-election as an independent, is at the heart of a scandal over his acquiescence to Trump officials to cooperate on immigration crackdowns while attempting to evade criminal charges.\\n```\\n\\n## [Justice Department investigating Andrew Cuomo over congressional testimony](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/justice-department-investigating-andrew-cuomo-congressional-testimony-rcna208133) (#31470)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 02:01:09+00:00\\n\\n```\\nWASHINGTON — The Justice Department is conducting a criminal investigation into former Gov.

It also put forward a June 2020 email addressed to staffers in the governor’s office that the “Governor’s edits are attached for your review.”Cuomo resigned as governor in August 2021 after state Attorney General Letitia James’ office published a report that found he had sexually harassed multiple women, including former aides, and the state Assembly launched an impeachment investigation.

Andrew Cuomo for allegedly lying to Congress about his decisions made during the COVID-19 pandemic while serving as governor, a source familiar with the probe confirmed to Fox News.The New York Times first reported that the U.S. attorney\\'s office in Washington opened the inquiry into Cuomo about a month ago after senior officials in the DOJ demanded an indictment of New York City Mayor Eric Adams for corruption charges be dismissed.The DOJ declined to comment to Fox News.The Trump administration is now in an unusual spot of ending a criminal case against Adams while opening a new case into Adams’ main rival within months of each other.Cuomo is running in the Democratic primary to serve as the next mayor of New York City, while Adams is seeking re-election as an independent candidate.HOUSE REPUBLICAN ASKS TRUMP DOJ TO CRIMINALLY PROSECUTE EX-NEW YORK GOV ANDREW CUOMO Former governor and mayoral candidate, Andrew Cuomo, (C) marches in the Celebrate Israel Parade up Fifth Avenue on May 18, 2025 in New York City.\\xa0 (Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty Images)\"We have never been informed of any such matter, so why would someone leak it now? The answer is obvious: This is lawfare and election interference plain and simple—something President Trump and his top Department of Justice officials say they are against,\" Rich Azzopardi, Cuomo’s spokesperson told Fox News. \"Governor Cuomo testified truthfully to the best of his recollection about events from four years earlier, and he offered to address any follow-up questions from the Subcommittee — but from the beginning this was all transparently political.\"The former governor was grilled by Republican lawmakers last year about his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. House Republicans subsequently recommended the Justice Department pursue criminal charges against him. They accused him of intentionally lying to Congress during the House Oversight Committee’s investigation into the excessive number of nursing home deaths.House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., referred Cuomo to President Donald Trump\\'s Justice Department for criminal prosecution.\\xa0BILL MAHER SUGGESTS ANDREW CUOMO\\'S NURSING HOME SCANDAL MAY COST HIS NYC MAYORAL CAMPAIGN Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo speaks outside the West Side Institutional Synagogue on April 1, 2025, in New York City.\\xa0 (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Cuomo – the Democratic scion now considered the current frontrunner in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary in June – was first referred to the Biden Justice Department for criminal prosecution in October 2024.\\xa0Former Rep. Brad Wenstrup, then-chairman of the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic, said Cuomo made \"multiple criminally false statements\" to Congress about his handling of the 2020 COVID-19 nursing home death scandal.\\xa0Cuomo, who was governor at the time, issued a March 2020 directive that initially barred nursing homes from refusing to accept patients who had tested positive for COVID-19. The directive was aimed at freeing up beds for overwhelmed hospitals.\\xa0More than 9,000 recovering coronavirus patients were released from hospitals into nursing homes under the directive, which was later rescinded amid speculation that it had accelerated outbreaks.\\xa0SECOND COVID NURSING HOME DEATH\\'S CASE AGAINST CUOMO TOSSED Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo arrives to testify before the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic in the Rayburn House Office Building at the U.S. Capitol on Sept. 10, 2024, in Washington, D.C. (Kent Nishimura)The eight plaintiffs in the case argued that their loved ones contracted COVID-19 in nursing homes and died as a result of the directive. They accused Cuomo and his administration of being civilly liable for their deaths as well as being liable for failing to accurately report the number of nursing home deaths in New York state that resulted from the virus.\\xa0Cuomo has previously said that the directive was based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) guidance at the time.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPA report released in March 2022 by the New York state comptroller found Cuomo\\'s Health Department \"was not transparent in its reporting of COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes\" and it \"understated the number of deaths at nursing homes by as much as 50%\" during some points of the pandemic.\\xa0In a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi last month, Comer said \"to our knowledge, the Biden Administration ignored this referral despite clear facts and evidence.\" He requested that Bondi review the referral and \"take appropriate action.\"\\xa0\"Andrew Cuomo is a man with a history of corruption and deceit, now caught red-handed lying to Congress during the Select Subcommittee’s investigation into the COVID-19 nursing home tragedy in New York,\" Comer said in a statement Monday. \"This wasn’t a slip-up – it was a calculated cover-up by a man seeking to shield himself from responsibility for the devastating loss of life in New York’s nursing homes. Let’s be clear: lying to Congress is a federal crime. Mr. Cuomo must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. The House Oversight Committee is prepared to fully cooperate with the Justice Department’s investigation into Andrew Cuomo’s actions and ensure he’s held to account.\"\\xa0Fox News Digital’s Michael Dorgan and Danielle Wallace contributed to this report.

Photograph: Accorsini Jeanne/ABACA/ShutterstockAFP noted that the French presidency made the announcement after Macron chaired a security meeting to examine a report sounding the alarm about the Muslim Brotherhood and saying the movement poses “a threat to national cohesion” in France.“Given the importance of the subject and the seriousness of the facts established, he has asked the government to draw up new proposals that will be examined at a forthcoming Defence Council meeting in early June,” the Élysée said.The report “clearly establishes the anti-republican and subversive nature of the Muslim Brotherhood” and “proposes ways to address this threat”, the presidency said ahead of the meeting, AFP reported.The publication sparked “heated reactions” across the political spectrum, the agency noted.In a rare move, Macron has also decided to make the report public by the end of the week, so expect more on this in the coming days.European unity against Putin in peril if Trump moves to ease sanctionsJennifer RankinEuropean leaders – who have promised to impose “massive” new sanctions on Russia after Vladimir Putin’s rejection of a ceasefire in Ukraine – face the prospect of having to introduce their planned expansion of economic restrictions on the Russian war economy without the United States.President Donald Trump meets with European Commission President Ursula von Der Leyen at the World Economic Forum in 2020. Photograph: Evan Vucci/APEuropean hopes that Donald Trump might increase the pressure on the Kremlin were dashed after the US president’s two-hour inconclusive phone call with Putin on Monday. Trump did not follow through on previous threats to introduce “large-scale” sanctions on Russia if there was no ceasefire, but instead extolled the prospect of restarting trade with Moscow.“Russia wants to do largescale TRADE with the United States when this catastrophic ‘bloodbath’ is over, and I agree,” Trump wrote on social media. Ukraine, he added, “can be a great beneficiary on Trade in the process of rebuilding its Country”.For Europe, the question is: what next? This week the EU approved its 17th round of sanctions against Russia, which had already been in the pipeline weeks before the latest ultimatums to Putin came and went.These were a more incremental set of measures than earlier rounds, as the EU finds it harder to agree new targets, with each sanction requiring unanimity and many big measures that command consensus having already been agreed.Read full analysis:And now let’s cross to our Brussels correspondent Jennifer Rankin for the latest on the European Union’s plans to impose further sanctions on Russia…Jakub KrupaBy the way, if you want to hear more about this shadow war, and about Russia’s espionage and assassination programmes – including long-term “illegal” sleepers and the new sabotage offensive across Europe, you can join our central and eastern Europe correspondent Shaun Walker on Thursday evening for a Guardian live event in person in London or online.He will be joined by Christo Grozev, an award-winning investigative journalist who has busted numerous Russian spies with his groundbreaking investigations. The late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny described him as “a modern-day Sherlock Holmes”.Speaking alongside Shaun and Christo will also be Daniela Richterova, who is the senior lecturer in Intelligence Studies at the Department of War Studies in King’s College London.Tickets are still available here.Portnov\\'s killing in Madrid - snap analysisShaun WalkerWe don’t know yet who killed Andriy Portnov in Madrid, but it may be the latest in a line of targeted killings in the shadow war between Russia and Ukraine.Police officers work at the scene outside the American School of Madrid in Pozuelo de Alarcon, Madrid, Spain, 21 May 2025, after a Ukrainian man, 52, was shot dead after dropping off his children at the school. Photograph: Borja Sanchez-Trillo/EPAIntelligence officials in Kyiv have said privately they expect this clandestine front of the battle to go on for years – even if a ceasefire and peace is achieved.Ukraine has never officially admitted to targeted killings of Russians and pro-war Ukrainians in Moscow and elsewhere, but the services in Kyiv are widely understood to have been behind some of them.Russia is also believed to have carried out its own targeted assassinations of Ukrainians and Russian defectors, including also in Spain – of defector pilot Maxim Kuzminov last year.Portugal opens probe into far-right leader\\'s comments on Roma communityPortuguese prosecutors have opened a probe into remarks made by far-right leader Andre Ventura against the Roma community, three days after an election in which his Chega party surged and was tied for second place in parliament, Reuters reported.The public prosecutor’s office said it had opened the investigation after receiving a complaint against Ventura. It gave no further details.The Letras Nomadas non-profit group, which promotes jobs and education for the Roma community, said it was one of 10 associations behind the complaint, which was made because they considered pre-election online videos published by Ventura as an incitement to hatred.In one of the videos, Ventura ranted at municipalities that he said were building social housing specifically for the Roma, asking: “But why are we building houses for gypsies? Are we building for normal people?““That video was the most offensive to us, although others were also pretty serious,” said Bruno Goncalves, vice-president of Letras Nomadas.Chega officials had no immediate reaction to the investigation, Reuters noted.Deborah ColeAnd here’s more on these arrests in Germany that I reported on earlier (14:11), from our Berlin correspondent Deborah Cole.Arrested adolescent members, suspected of forming a far-right \"terrorist\" group, are escorted by police as they leave the Federal Public Prosecutor in Karlsruhe, Germany.

Photograph: Paul White/AP\\nUnidentified gunmen have shot and killed a former Ukrainian politician, Andriy Portnov, outside a school in an upmarket suburb of Madrid.\\nThe killing of Portnov, who had worked as a senior aide to Ukraine’s pro-Russia former president, Viktor Yanukovych, took place on Wednesday morning outside the American School of Madrid in Pozuelo de Alarcón.\\nAuthorities said he had been targeted when he was getting into his car, a black Mercedes-Benz. “Several persons shot him in the back and the head and then fled towards a forested area,” said a source at Spain’s interior ministry.\\nLocal media said Portnov had been dropping off his children at the school, where classes had begun 30 minutes before the shooting. He was found dead when medics arrived and had sustained at least three shots to his body, according to Madrid’s emergency services.\\nPolice cordoned off the car park of the private school, while helicopters and drones circled above, searching for the suspected killers.\\nWidely seen as a pro-Russia political figure, Portnov, 52, had been involved in drafting legislation targeting participants of the 2014 revolution in Ukraine before Yanukovych was ousted by a popular uprising.\\nPortnov fled Ukraine shortly afterwards. In 2015, he was reportedly living in Russia and later relocated to Austria. In recent years, he had been the subject of multiple investigations.\\nIn 2018, Ukraine’s security service SBU opened an investigation against him on suspicion of state treason, alleging Portnov was involved in Russia’s illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula. The criminal case was closed in 2019.\\nIn 2021, the US Treasury department imposed sanctions upon him, alleging that “Portnov took steps to control the Ukrainian judiciary, influence associated legislation, sought to place loyal officials in senior judiciary positions, and purchase court decisions”.\\nPortnov, who was also the subject of European Union sanctions that were later dropped, appeared to have been living in Madrid since at least April 2024, according to a report by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.\\nSince Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Spain has been the scene of several high-profile crimes involving Russians and Ukrainians.\\nBack to Madrid, Spanish media quoted a 19-year-old student who lives nearby the place of the killing of a US-sanctioned ex-Ukrainian MP and senior aide to the country’s former pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych, Andrii Portnov.She tsaid she woke up to the sound of “six or seven gunshots, a scream, and the prolonged honk of a car.“I raised the blinds and didn’t see anything. Ten minutes later, the police arrived. I went downstairs and saw the man lying on the ground, covered in a lot of blood,” she said.The agency also reported that “drones and a helicopter are flying over the area, which has been cordoned off, in an attempt to locate the alleged perpetrator or perpetrators of the murder.”EFE also said that “the school stated that the victim was a parent of students at the school.”EU wants to reduce bureaucracy for medium-sized companiesThe EU unveiled plans to cut red tape for medium-sized companies and abolish barriers for businesses to sell goods across the bloc’s single market as part of its efforts to catch up with China and the United States, AFP reported.European Commission\\'s Executive vice-president for Prosperity and Industrial Strategy, Stephane Sejourne, speaks during a press conference on the Single Market Strategy and Fourth Omnibus proposal on small mid-caps, following the EU\\'s College of Commissioners meeting in Brussels, Belgium. Photograph: Olivier Hoslet/EPAHere are the details of the proposals.AFP noted that the European Union wants to make doing business in the 27-country bloc easier and attract investment, as US President Donald Trump pushes an America First policy.The latest raft of proposals come after the EU said earlier this year it would simplify environmental rules for farmers and businesses to boost economic growth, AFP said.Brussels wants medium-sized businesses to benefit from some of the same exemptions – including on data protection rules – previously enjoyed only by smaller firms, to reduce their administrative burden, it added.The changes create a new category of companies, “small mid-caps”, which have between 250 and 750 employees, and either up to 150 million euros ($170 million) in turnover or up to 129 million euros in total assets, the European Commission said.\\nThere are nearly 38,000 firms that meet the criteria in the EU, it said.The proposals will need to be approved by the EU parliament and member states.Germany, EU talk with US about new sanctions on RussiaGermany and the European Union are in talks with all concerned parties in the United States on new sanctions against Russia over Moscow’s war in Ukraine, a German government spokesperson said.“I cannot comment on these internal American debates, but rest assured that Europe and the (German) federal government are also talking to all the players in the USA,” the spokesperson said at a regular government press conference, quoted by Reuters.Germany arrests minors suspected of forming far-right \\'terrorist\\' groupGerman authorities arrested five adolescents suspected of forming a far-right terrorist group and said the charges included attempted murder and severe arson, Reuters reported.An exterior view of the Federal Supreme Court (BGH) in Karlsruhe, Germany. Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPAThe arrests, and three earlier similar arrests, follow arson attacks on a community centre in the eastern state of Brandenburg in October and on a migrant shelter in Saxony in January.Federal prosecutors said the suspects were male culpable minors who formed a group which styled itself as the “last wave of defence” to protect the “German nation“.The group’s “aim is to commit acts of violence primarily against migrants and political opponents to bring about the collapse of the democratic system of Germany,” the prosecutors’ statement said.Jakub KrupaI will keep an eye for more updates out of Madrid, where a US-sanctioned ex-Ukrainian MP and senior aide to the country’s former pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych was shot dead, but in the meantime let me bring you some updates on other stories around Europe.Spanish daily El Mundo said, quoting its sources in Madrid police, that investigators looking into the reported killing of Andrii Portnov are focusing on two potential motives: settling of scores after a dispute between criminal gangs, or a political murder.Russian ship detected in \\'suspicious\\' activity near Poland-Sweden cable, Polish PM saysElsewhere, Poland’s prime minister Donald Tusk just said the Polish military was forced to intervene on the Baltic Sea after a Russian ship from the sanctioned “shadow fleet” performed what he described as “suspicious manoeuvres” near the power cable connecting Poland with Sweden.Poland’s survey ship ORP Herweliusz is on its way to the place of the incident to investigate further, he said.The Polish grid operator PSE confirmed the cable was still operational.\\n```\\n\\n## [Ex-Ukrainian presidential adviser shot dead in Spain – media](https://www.rt.com/news/617964-ukraine-portnov-assassination-spain/) (#34736)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 12:27:31+00:00\\n\\n```\\nNews outlets have identified the victim as lawyer and former lawmaker Andrey Portnov, once an aide to Viktor Yanukovich\\nFormer Ukrainian lawmaker and presidential adviser Andrey Portnov was fatally shot in a suburb of the Spanish capital, Madrid, on Wednesday, local media has reported.The circumstances of the murder suggest it may have been an “extrajudicial execution,” as Portnov may have had access to information that could threaten figures in Vladimir Zelensky’s administration, Rodion Miroshnik, Russia’s ambassador-at-large overseeing a special mission on alleged Ukrainian war crimes, has said.The killing occurred in Pozuelo de Alarcon, according to the newspaper El Pais. Portnov, 51, was reportedly approached by two or three assailants and shot at least five times, including three times in the head, while inspecting the trunk of his Mercedes car, near a private school attended by his children.Spanish authorities have confirmed a homicide took place in the area but are yet to formally identify the victim.Portnov, a lawyer by training, served in the Ukrainian parliament from 2006 to 2010. He later joined President Viktor Yanukovich’s administration, overseeing judicial reform as deputy chief of staff and helping draft a new criminal code that was adopted in 2012.\\nIn 2014, Portnov fled Ukraine following the Western-backed armed coup in Kiev that ousted Yanukovich’s government. Despite going into exile, he remained active in Ukrainian political discourse, frequently appearing on national television.Portnov returned to the country in 2019 to support presidential candidate Vladimir Zelensky. After Zelensky won the election, Portnov filed several legal complaints against outgoing President Pyotr Poroshenko, alleging various offenses committed during his time in office. None of those cases resulted in convictions.He reportedly left Ukraine again in June 2022. At the time, Ukrainian media described him as being aligned with “pro-Russian media” outlets that had been shut down by the Zelensky administration and he was accused of making disparaging remarks about the nature of the 2014 coup.Portnov has been listed since at least 2015 by Mirotvorets, a controversial semi-official public database that catalogs individuals deemed enemies of Ukraine. Several people listed by the site have been murdered over its decade of operation.Ukrainian intelligence services have previously claimed or implied involvement in a number of targeted killings of individuals labeled as enemies by Kiev. Some of those assassinations have occurred outside Ukraine, including the December 2023 shooting of former Ukrainian lawmaker Ilya Kiva near Moscow.\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

A local deputy commissioner, Yasir Iqbal, said the attack occurred in Khuzdar, a district in Balochistan province, as the bus was transporting children to school in the city.No group immediately claimed responsibility, though suspicion is likely to fall on ethnic Baloch separatists, who frequently target security forces and civilians in the region.Pakistan’s Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi strongly condemned the attack and expressed deep sorrow over the children’s deaths. He called the perpetrators “beasts” who deserve no leniency, saying the enemy had committed an act of “sheer barbarism by targeting innocent children.”Balochistan has been the scene of a long-running insurgency, with an array of separatist groups staging attacks, including the outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army, designated as a terrorist organization by the United States in 2019.The latest attack came days after a car bombing killed four people near a market in Qillah Abdullah, a city in Balochistan province bordering Afghanistan.Most of such attacks are claimed by BLA, which Pakistan says enjoyed the backing of neighboring India.In one of the deadliest such attacks in March, BLA insurgents killed 33 people, mostly soldiers, during an assault on a train carrying hundreds of passengers in Balochistan.\\n```\\n\\n## [A suicide car bomb hits a school bus in restive southwestern Pakistan, killing 4 children and wounding 38, officials say](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/suicide-car-bomb-hits-school-bus-restive-southwestern-122018340) (#34912)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 06:05:52+00:00\\n\\n```\\nA suicide car bomb hits a school bus in restive southwestern Pakistan, killing 4 children and wounding 38, officials sayByThe Associated PressMay 21, 2025, 1:15 AMQUETTA, Pakistan -- A suicide car bomb hits a school bus in restive southwestern Pakistan, killing 4 children and wounding 38, officials say.Sponsored Content by Taboola\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

She knew exactly what she was doing when she briefed that into the papers. She is demanding eight new tax rises, as if we haven’t suffered enough.“People out there are struggling, businesses are struggling, people are losing their jobs. We cannot have more tax rises. Will the Prime Minister rule out new tax rises this year?”Prime Minister Sir Keir replied: “(The Conservatives) lost the election because of their appalling record on the NHS, on health, on prisons, you name it, and now she accuses everyone of ‘whining’ about the impact.”He added: “She wants to talk about the Deputy Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister’s – working with the Chancellor (Rachel Reeves) – building 1.5 million new homes, reforming our planning system, putting £7 billion into our economy and bringing forward an Employment Rights Bill.”Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer defended Ms Rayner (Hannah McKay/PA)PA WireMrs Badenoch described his response as “desperate stuff” when she returned to the despatch box.She said: “The whole House will have heard the Prime Minister refuse to rule out new tax rises – the whole House heard it, he didn’t rule it out.“His Cabinet is open warfare, the Deputy Prime Minister (Angela Rayner) clearly calling the shots. What is it that we’ve learned?“We’re heading for new tax rises, we know inflation is up, it’s just more and more bad news from a Prime Minister who has lost control.”Mrs Badenoch said she would ask “a simple question” and added: “It only requires one word – yes or no – is he planning to U-turn on winter fuel cuts?”Sir Keir replied: “We will look at the threshold, but that will have to be part of a fiscal event.”Mrs Badenoch asked how Labour backbenchers could “ever trust” Sir Keir after the “inevitable U-turn on winter fuel” payments.She said: “Look at all of them (Labour MPs) behind him, all of them cheering when this inevitable U-turn on winter fuel comes, and it will from a desperate Prime Minister, what will he say to the 348 MPs who went over the top and voted for the winter fuel cut last September?“Just like the British public, how can any of them ever trust him again?”After laughter from Labour MPs when she said they looked “sick”, the leader of the Opposition urged them to put their hands up if they “wanted winter fuel cuts”.Mrs Badenoch challenged Sir Keir at PMQs (House of Commons/PA)PA WireShe said: “His winter fuel cut has driven thousands into hardship.“His MPs hate this. He can’t see them, but they all look sick just hearing what it is he’s going to do. They’re laughing.”Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle then called for order from Labour MPs who continued to jeer and laugh.Mrs Badenoch challenged Sir Keir’s backbenchers: “Hands up, who here wanted winter fuel cuts? Hands up.“Not a single one of them. Not a single one of them. The fact of the matter is this Prime Minister is destroying them.”Turning to look at the backbenches, Sir Keir replied: “They look in pretty good form to me, and there’s lots of them.”\\n```\\n\\n## [Angela Rayner memo shows fault lines in Labour tax and spend philosophy](https://www.ft.com/content/c714047c-267b-4415-af41-82ffd36be437) (#31933)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 08:30:00+00:00\\n\\n```\\nThis article is an on-site version of our Inside Politics newsletter.

Angela Rayner wanted tax rises, not spending cuts in the spring. Rachel Reeves is contemplating changes to the winter fuel allowance. Some thoughts on both stories and what links them in today’s note. Inside Politics is edited by Georgina Quach. Follow Stephen on Bluesky and X, and Georgina on Bluesky. Read the previous edition of the newsletter here. Please send gossip, thoughts and feedback to insidepolitics@ft.comRayner on their paradeOver at the Telegraph, Ben Riley-Smith has a scoop that is turning heads in Labourworld: a leaked memo from Angela Rayner to Rachel Reeves before the Spring Statement two months ago, suggesting a swath of tax rises as a way to respond to the government’s straitened finances. (All the details of what she proposed here.) The revelation comes as Reeves said she was “listening” to concerns about the government’s policy of means-testing the winter fuel allowance, the first public acknowledgment of a debate in government over whether to U-turn, or at least partially U-turn, on the measure.There are two really important things to note here. The first is that almost everyone in the Labour party believes that, as it stands, Angela Rayner is the inevitable winner should Keir Starmer stand down or be removed as Labour leader. That’s one reason why I think there is no prospect of a leadership change — several MPs have told me that they do not believe that “they” (that is to say, the Downing Street operation) would allow a leadership race while it is so obvious that Rayner would come after. It also disincentivises supporters of other potential candidates to be troublemakers, given they know that it will be Rayner and her allies, not them, who takes over. (That isn’t because there is a lot of personal antipathy to her: the deputy prime minister is well-liked personally, but a combination of philosophical differences and personal ambition means not everyone in the government wants a Rayner coronation.) The other thing to know is that few in the government think the administration is in good health. They believe they need some sort of change, but what?Rayner’s proposed tax rises are riddled with measures that would have unwanted side effects, but what really matters is what her memo represents: an explicit argument that Labour would be better off taxing more and spending more, rather than looking for more ways to salami-slice government spending.The mad thing is that the government, as it stands, is planning cuts to university funding, cuts to welfare spending, and an across the board drawing down of spending in the middle of the parliament\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009while at same time it is flirting with U-turning on a decision to means-test a benefit to the richest demographic in the UK.If the government thinks it can’t sell winter fuel cuts to the public, the idea that its present spending plans and its pledge not to raise taxes can be met are, in a word: nuts. The second that Reeves buckles on the winter fuel allowance, then the government is going to come under further pressure to not carry through with its reductions in welfare spending, to scrap the two-child benefit cap, and to spend more on the public realm across the board.What links these stories is they are the product of the same policy reality: that no government since 2015 has been able to deliver significant reductions in public spending on top of what happened 2010 to 2015 without hitting the rocks of public opinion. The big question is whether the government is going to recognise that and abandon its attempts to do so this year, or if they are going to go for the worst-of-all-worlds approach in which they retreat on winter fuel and at the same time try to press ahead with cuts to other bits of public spending, that will neither be believed nor delivered.

But insiders said it was not unusual for discussion papers to be commissioned at official level without ministerial sign-off.\\xa0It was titled \\'alternative proposals for raising revenue\\' and stated the policies \\'would be popular, prudent and would not raise taxes on working people\\'.\\xa0Mooted tweaks included reinstating the pensions lifetime allowance – a £1million cap on how much could be saved in a pension without incurring higher tax charges.Ms Rayner\\'s memo also suggested freezing the threshold at which the additional rate of income tax kicks in. It is fixed at £125,140 until April 2028, but she recommended continuing the freeze – dragging more people into the top tax band over time.The document also proposed ending inheritance tax relief on shares in firms on the Alternative Investment Market.In the end the centrepiece of the Spring Statement was a crackdown on welfare to stop the bill spiralling out of control.Ms Reeves has been hinting she is considering the threshold at which winter fuel allowance is removed after the cut was seen as a factor in dire local election results.She stripped nine million pensioners of the payments - worth up to £300 - soon after Labour came to power. Only those on pension credit are still entitled.But Sir\\xa0Keir is facing the threat of a revolt over that policy, as well as curbs to working age benefits.\\xa0There is speculation that the leadership is looking for a way out, potentially by scaling back the cuts.\\xa0\\xa0The behind-the-scenes wrangling was revealed as new figures underlined the scale of the problems facing the government.UK\\xa0inflation\\xa0was up from 2.6 per cent in March to 3.5 per cent in so-called \\'Awful April\\', a peak not seen since January 2024.\\xa0Worryingly, it was significantly more than the 3.3 per cent analysts had pencilled in, with Ms\\xa0Reeves\\xa0acknowledging the figures were \\'disappointing\\' and her national insurance hikes were partly to blame.\\xa0 Core CPI - excluding energy, food,\\xa0alcohol and tobacco - was also at the highest for a year.The grim data will fuel Bank of England concerns about underling pressures, with chief economist Huw Pill having already warned that interest rate cuts have been too fast.\\xa0Experts immediately suggested that Threadneedle Street might pause reductions at the next monetary policy committee meeting next month. The Bank had forecast that inflation would top out at 3.5 per cent in the third quarter of the year.The spike comes after Ofgem\\'s energy price cap rose by 6.4 per cent in April, having fallen a year earlier.\\xa0That was alongside a raft of bill rises for struggling households, including steep increases to water charges, council tax, mobile and broadband\\xa0tariffs. Meanwhile, Labour\\'s NICs and minimum wage increases will have been stoking pressure in the system.\\xa0Shadow Chancellor Mel Stride said: \\'The Chancellor has repeatedly refused to rule out another tax raid in the autumn and now we know why – Labour\\'s top brass want to come back for more.\\'\\n```\\n\\n## [Keir Starmer refuses to rule out MORE tax hikes as Rayner pushes for pensions raid in leaked memo to Reeves](https://londonjournal.co.uk/2025/05/21/keir-starmer-refuses-to-rule-out-more-tax-hikes-as-rayner-pushes-for-pensions-raid-in-leaked-memo-to-reeves/) (#35117)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 12:42:23+00:00\\n\\n```\\nPA\\nScreen grab of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer speaking during Prime Minister’s Questions in the House of Commons, London.

This could generate additional revenue for the government but might lead to banks passing on costs to consumers via higher fees or reduced lending. It could also affect the competitiveness of UK banks internationally.\\nExtending the Threshold Freeze for the 45% Tax Rate:\\nFreezing the threshold for the 45% income tax rate would pull more people into the higher tax bracket over time as wages increase. This measure is often seen as a “stealth tax,” as it raises government revenue without explicitly increasing tax rates. It would primarily affect high earners.\\nScrapping the Tax-Free Allowance on Dividends:\\nRemoving the tax-free allowance on dividends would mean investors, including small shareholders, would pay tax on all dividend income. This measure could discourage investment in UK companies and impact individuals relying on dividend income, particularly retirees.\\nReinstating the Lifetime Pensions Allowance:\\nReintroducing the cap on how much can be saved into pensions before higher tax rates apply would limit the tax advantages of pension savings for high earners. This could reduce incentives for long-term savings but generate additional tax revenue. It would primarily impact wealthier individuals with large pension pots.\\nIt also highlights a split at the top of government ahead of the Autumn budget following tensions amid the end of universal winter fuel payments and also disability benefits.\\nBut Environment Secretary Steve Reed said the Cabinet was “united” on its tax and spend policies.\\nHe told the BBC: “You wouldn’t expect me to comment on leaks and speculation.\\nBut I know from being in the Cabinet when the discussions happen that the Cabinet is united.”\\nWelfare Secretary Liz Kendall also insisted that the “entire Cabinet backs Rachel’s economic strategy”.\\nBut left-wing MPs rallied round the proposals outlined in the secret memo.\\nLabour backbencher Neil Duncan-Jordan said the government should “absolutely” should be looked at.\\nHe told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: “There is a very healthy debate inside the Labour Party at the moment about how we should be raising additional funds rather than cutting benefits and there is a menu, I think, of options that we should be using and these are just some of those.”\\nPlans put forward include new money-raising raids on the million people who pay the additional rate of income tax and also altering rules on dividend taxes, The Telegraph reported.\\nOther measures to be considered look at reinstating the pensions lifetime allowance which was just over £1 million before higher taxes kicked in.\\nAnother suggestion was for banks to pay higher corporation tax levels.\\nShadow Chancellor Mel Stride said: “This confirms that we are still living with the Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn.\\n“At the very highest level, Labour ministers are debating which taxes to increase next.”\\nHe added: “The Chancellor has repeatedly refused to rule out another tax raid in the autumn and now we know why – Labour’s top brass, including the Deputy Prime Minister, want to come back for more.”\\nWhitehall insiders said they welcomed contributions from colleagues at the top of government but all tax and spend policies were a matter for the Chancellor.\\nA Government spokesperson said: “We don’t comment on leaks.”\\nA secret memo by Deputy PM Angela Rayner has been sent to the Chancellor calling for punishing new tax raidsgetty\\nSource link\\n```\\n\\n## [Angela Rayner ‘identifies Rachel Reeves as a weakness’ as ‘secret memo’ sparks Labour row](https://www.gbnews.com/politics/angela-rayner-rachel-reeves-labour-row-secret-memo-oscar-reddrop) (#40865)\\n\\n> 2025-05-22 06:57:42+00:00\\n\\n```\\nAngela Rayner has identified Chancellor Rachel Reeves as a “weakness” in the Labour Government, according to political commentator Oscar Reddrop.The Deputy Prime Minister is embroiled in a leaked memo row after it was revealed she called on Reeves to increase taxes prior to this year’s Spring Statement.The memo - seen by the Daily Telegraph - appeared to call on Reeves to hike taxes by £3bn to £4bn a year through various measures.According to Reddrop, Rayner is positioning herself as an alternative for the Labour leadership as Prime Minister Keir Starmer continues to flounder in the polls.Asked if she is pitching for the top job, he said: “100 per cent. She is identifying that Rachel Reeves is a real weakness for this Government.“The Number 10 and Number 11 relationship when times are tough can get really fraught.“I think Keir Starmer will be banging his desk in frustration at the trouble Rachel Reeves is causing this Government.“What Rayner is doing is politically smart.”Labour\\'s struggles were discussed on GB News GB NEWSThe Reeves and Rayner rift marks the most significant division within Labour’s senior Cabinet since the party came to power in July last year.The leaked memo suggested several specific tax measures targeting the wealthy. These included ending inheritance tax relief for AIM shares, increasing taxes on dividends, and reinstating the pensions lifetime allowance.The pensions lifetime allowance, which was abolished under the previous Conservative government, had limited how much savers could put in their pension pot before facing higher tax charges.Other proposals included closing the commercial property stamp duty loophole and implementing a higher corporation tax rate for banks.Chancellor Rachel Reeves PAIn total, the document estimated that eight proposed changes could raise between £3bn and £4bn annually. However, these proposals were not adopted by the Chancellor in her Spring Statement.Rayner\\'s tax proposals come as the government faces intense anger from Labour MPs over £5bn in cuts to sickness and disability benefits announced in March.Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall is expected to defend these controversial reforms in a speech today at the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), despite a looming rebellion.Over 100 Labour MPs have reportedly written to the Chief Whip indicating they cannot support the government on this issue, raising fears that Prime Minister Keir Starmer could face his biggest Commons revolt yet.Some left-wing MPs have urged the Prime Minister to introduce a wealth tax on the assets of the country\\'s super-rich as an alternative to disability benefit cuts.Shadow Chancellor Mel Stride criticised the leaked proposals, claiming they showed \"we are still living with the Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn.\"\"At the very highest level, Labour ministers are debating which taxes to increase next,\" he added. \"The Chancellor has repeatedly refused to rule out another tax raid in the autumn, and now we know why - Labour\\'s top brass, including the Deputy Prime Minister, want to come back for more.\"Rayner, who rose to prominence as a supporter of Jeremy Corbyn following an exodus of moderate Labour figures in 2016, has had previous tensions with Starmer, including her removal as Labour Party chair in 2021.Environment Secretary Steve Reed responded to the reports, telling the BBC: \"You wouldn\\'t expect me to comment on leaks and speculation. But I know from being in the Cabinet when discussions happen, the Cabinet is united behind the government\\'s Plan for Change.\"Reed added that the government has already increased taxes on the wealthy, noting: \"We have brought non-doms - those are those foreign billions who live in our country, who were paying no tax previously, now they are liable to paying their taxes like everyone else.\"\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

He added it could have the capability of intercepting missiles “even if they are launched from space”.The US President announced General Michael Guetlein, who currently serves as the vice chief of space operations, will be responsible for overseeing the proposed dome’s progress.An initial sum of $25bn (£18.7bn) had been earmarked in a new bill - although the Congressional Budget Office estimated it could end up costing $542bn (£404bn) over the next 20 years. Huge doubts have been raised about whether America will be able to deliver a defence system covering its enormous land mass which is able to detect and stop missiles during a potential attack.The Pentagon has warned for years that the newest missiles developed by China and Russia are so advanced that updated countermeasures are necessary. US President Donald Trump speaks in the Oval OfficeAFP via Getty ImagesGolden Dome’s added satellites and interceptors - where the bulk of the programme’s cost is - would be focused on stopping those advanced weapons early on or in the middle of their flight.Trump said he had not yet spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin about the dome “but at the right time, we will”.He told reporters at the White House the system would consist of “next-generation” technologies across land, sea and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors. He added that Canada had asked to be a part of it.“There really is no current system,” Trump said. “We have certain areas of missiles and certain missile defence, but there is no system... there has never been anything like this.”In a joint statement earlier this month, China and Russia called the Golden Dome idea “deeply destabilising in nature,” warning it would turn “outer space into an environment for placing weapons and an arena for armed confrontation.”\\n```\\n\\n## [SpaceX Poised to Profit From Trump’s Golden Dome Fantasy](https://gizmodo.com/spacex-poised-to-profit-from-trumps-golden-dome-fantasy-2000605678) (#40712)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 20:20:28+00:00\\n\\n```\\n“First buddy” Elon Musk is the frontrunner to build this billion-dollar missile shield.\\nElon Musk’s SpaceX is reportedly chomping at the bit to build Trump’s $175 billion “Golden Dome” defense system, designed to protect the U.S. from foreign missiles “even if they are launched from the other side of the world.”\\xa0 Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth unveiled the first details of the project during an Oval Office briefing on Tuesday, claiming that it can be completed in three years at the cost $175 billion. Both the budget and timeline conflict with a Congressional Budget Office assessment, which estimates that the project could take 20 years and cost $524 billion.\\xa0 This unusually large and complex space shield would consist of a vast network of satellites capable of detecting, tracking, and intercepting incoming missiles, in addition to a smaller fleet of offensive satellites, Reuters reports.\\nThe GOP-led budget reconciliation bill, which is progressing to the House for consideration, includes $25 billion to jumpstart the Golden Dome project, according to The Hill. Leaders in aerospace tech are already clamoring to get their hands on a contract, including Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and—of course—SpaceX.\\xa0 In April, sources told Reuters that Musk’s satellite and spaceflight company made a bid to build key parts of the Golden Dome in partnership with two other U.S.-based companies: software firm Palantir and drone manufacturer Anduril.\\nAround that time, these companies pitched their plan to the Trump administration and the Pentagon, which would involve launching potentially more than 1,000 new defense satellites for sensing and tracking missiles, in addition to a separate fleet of 200 attack satellites armed with missiles or lasers, according to Reuters. In a letter sent to Defense Department inspector general Steven Stebbins on May 1, a group of 42 Democratic lawmakers requested a review of the Pentagon’s procurement process for the Golden Dome project, citing conflict of interest concerns over this potential deal with Musk.\\n“All of this raises concerns about whether defense contracts to build a Golden Dome are an effective way to protect Americans or are meant to enrich Mr. Musk and other elites,” they wrote.\\xa0 In addition to generating substantial new revenue for SpaceX and boosting the company’s valuation, a Golden Dome contract could give Musk “unacceptable ongoing leverage” over U.S. national security, the lawmakers warned.\\xa0 The group pointed to SpaceX’s proposal to run this defense system via a “subscription service.” This could allow the company to bypass the Pentagon’s procurement rules and exercise unchecked control over the cost and development of the Golden Dome, The Hill reported.\\xa0 “Mr. Musk could, as he allegedly did in Ukraine, determine when to provide the U.S. government with access to Golden Dome satellite systems,” the lawmakers wrote.\\nGizmodo reached out to SpaceX for comment but did not receive a response by the time of publication.\\xa0 Since donating more than $250 million to Trump’s election campaign, Musk has become part of the furniture of his administration, serving as a special government employee, senior advisor to the president, and a key official at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\\xa0 It’s worth noting that his Golden Dome bidding partners, Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel and Anduril founder Palmer Luckey, are also longtime supporters of Trump.\\nIt’s hardly the first time Musk’s ties to the president have raised concerns. In April, a report from Senate Democrats estimated that he and his companies face at least $2.37 billion in legal exposure due to the many conflicts of interest he has acquired through his work with DOGE.\\xa0 Despite this, it’s reasonable to believe that the Pentagon could select SpaceX to lead construction on the Golden Dome. Defense officials may feel that Musk’s company is well-positioned to tackle this project for several reasons.\\xa0 For one, SpaceX has launched hundreds of spy satellites over the last five years, and sources told Reuters that several recently launched prototypes could be retrofitted for the project. The company also has experience building satellite constellations through Starlink—a network made up of more than 11,000 satellites.\\nWhat’s more, SpaceX’s fleet of reusable rockets could help ensure that the Golden Dome project stays within the tight budget and timing constraints the Trump administration has set for it, though that will still be a herculean task.\\xa0 If SpaceX is not chosen for this task, it’s not immediately clear which launch provider could do the heavy lifting. United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan Centaur and Blue Origin’s New Glenn are both possible contenders, but these heavy-lift vehicles have yet to prove themselves.\\xa0 Depending on the size and weight of the Golden Dome satellites, other U.S. launch providers could conceivably help, including Firefly Aerospace. In February, Firefly signed a $21.8 million contract with the Pentagon to launch a mission under the military’s quick-reaction space program, which aims to demonstrate the Space Force’s ability to rapidly deploy satellites in an emergency.\\xa0 Even with SpaceX’s advantages, it’s not clear whether it—or any leading tech company for that matter—could actually pull this project off. No country has ever launched a space-based defense system of this scale before, and it’s difficult to predict the amount of time and money it will take to build and deploy this technology.\\nThere are geopolitical tensions to consider as well. Today, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry urged the U.S. to abandon the project, stating that Golden Dome will “heighten the risk of turning space into a war zone and creating a space arms race and shake the international security and arms control system,” ABC News reports. Whether the Pentagon and its future Golden Dome contractors can overcome these hurdles remains to be seen. If SpaceX gets in on the action, it could open up a whole new world of technological, ethical, and legal challenges for Musk.\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

Those who were rescued were taken to Calais. The remaining migrants onboard continued their journey to the UK under French Navy surveillance.Pictures showed people wrapped in blankets being brought ashore on a Border Force boat in Dover, Kent, on Wednesday morning.

The Maritime Prefect of the Channel and the North Sea said on Monday that 62 people were pulled from the water after an “overloaded” boat broke up overnight.Gunes Kalkan, Head of Campaigns at charity Safe Passage International, said: “It’s been another devastating week in the Channel, with more people needlessly losing their lives in search of safety.“These losses can’t be prevented whilst people fleeing war and persecution don’t have safe routes to ask for protection here.“We need international cooperation with European nations to be focused on providing safe routes and protection, through a refugee visa and expanding family reunion.”Some 49 people arrived in Britain in one boat on Tuesday, according to the latest Home Office figures.

The country’s security forces have recently escalated their campaign to eliminate leftist militants.Credit...Jalees Andrabi/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesMay 21, 2025Security forces killed at least 27 people in central India on Wednesday, in an operation that the police said had targeted Maoist militants, as the authorities intensify a military campaign aimed at defeating the country’s decades-old leftist insurgency.Prabhat Kumar, a police chief in the state of Chhattisgarh, said that “several senior-level Maoist cadres” had been killed or seriously injured in the operation on Wednesday. Local media reported that a top leader of the rebels, Nambala Keshav Rao, who goes by Basavaraju, was among those killed.Last week, in another bloody confrontation, the government said it had killed 31 members of the movement in a hilly region between Chhattisgarh and a neighboring state.Amit Shah, India’s home minister, called that operation a “historic breakthrough.” He has set a deadline of March for wiping out the whole of the insurgency, which has raged fitfully for more than 50 years.Human rights activists have warned of the possibility that innocent civilians have been killed in the campaign against the rebels. Bela Bhatia, a lawyer who works in regions affected by the insurgency, said that while rapid identification of the bodies by family members was crucial, the government often took days to present corpses.She also said that when the Indian government claimed to have killed insurgents, it was unclear if “the killed Maoists surrendered and were then killed, or if they died in an encounter.”India’s Maoist movement began as a guerrilla-style insurgency in the 1960s, when offshoots of Communist parties took up arms in the name of creating a classless society. It started in the eastern parts of the country and spread to the central and southern regions. The places where they are still active are collectively called the Red Corridor, a mostly forested area abundant in natural resources.At its inception, the movement was a struggle for redistribution of land among landless farmers. Later, the cause became more associated with the rights of the 9 percent of Indians who belong to Indigenous minority groups. The fighters’ leaders have said they aim to protect tribal communities’ access to natural resources.The Indian state regards the Maoists as an enormous threat, and critics say that this has led to military excesses in clamping down on the movement. In 2009, the prime minister at the time, Manmohan Singh, called them the country’s “biggest internal security challenge.” He made that assessment even after Islamist terrorists from Pakistan had been linked just a year before to a devastating attack in Mumbai.During that period, India’s security forces were escalating a military campaign to defeat the Maoists. The conflict has claimed thousands of lives on both sides in the past five decades.The current operations, which are happening under the shadow of a frightening military exchange this month with Pakistan, are proving to be deadly even by historical standards. So far this year, more than 200 insurgents have been killed, according to government data. The government says 700 others have given up arms and surrendered.Along with the sprint to crush the insurgency directly, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has undertaken development initiatives, like building wider roads to the remote regions where the movement has thrived. The hope has been that greater outreach to local residents, most of them tribal minorities, might persuade them to oppose the insurgents.“But the people are suspicious,” Ms. Bhatia said. Many who live in those parts of the country depend on the forest for their livelihood. “They wonder if this development is only to aid in mining and exploiting natural resources,” Ms. Bhatia said.Pragati K.B. is a reporter for The Times based in New Delhi, covering news from across India.A version of this article appears in print on \\xa0, Section A, Page 6 of the New York edition with the headline: India’s Forces Kill Dozens In a Bid to Defeat Rebels.

In the past 16 months, more than 400 alleged Maoist rebels have been killed in Chhattisgarh state, home to a sizable population of Adivasis (meaning original inhabitants or Indigenous people).\\nBut activists are alarmed: They say many of those killed are innocent Adivasis. And campaigners and opposition leaders are urging the government to cease fire and hold talks with Maoist rebels to find a solution to the decades-old issue.\\nMore than 11,000 civilians and security forces have been killed in clashes involving Maoist fighters\\xa0between 2000 and 2024, according to official figures. Security forces have killed at least 6,160 Maoist fighters during the same period, according to police and Maoist figures.\\nSo, will the government’s hardline approach help bring peace, or will it further alienate the Adivasis, who are already one of the most marginalised groups in the country?\\nWho are the Maoists, and why are they fighting against the Indian state?\\nThe armed rebellion in India originated in a 1967 rural uprising in the small town of Naxalbari, located in West Bengal state. The word Naxal comes from the town’s name.\\nLed by communist leaders Kanu Sanyal, Charu Majumdar, and Jungle Santal, the armed uprising called for addressing the issues of landlessness and exploitation of the rural poor by landlords.\\nThe three leaders founded the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) (CPI(ML)) on April 22, 1969, to wage armed rebellion against the Indian state. They believed that their demands were not going to be met by the prevailing democratic set-up.\\nThe Naxal rebels were also inspired by the revolutionary ideology of the Chinese leader Mao Zedong. Modelled on the Chinese communist party’s approach to capturing the state, they waged a violent rebellion against the Indian security forces in mineral-rich central and eastern India for decades. The West Bengal government, led by Congress leader Siddhartha Shankar Ray, launched a fierce campaign to suppress the Naxalite uprising.\\nI once again assure the countrymen that India is sure to be Naxal-free by 31 March 2026\\nby\\xa0Amit Shah, home minister\\nSanyal, one of the founding leaders of the movement, told this reporter in 2010 that “by 1973, at least 32,000 Naxalites or sympathisers had been jailed across India.”\\n“Many were killed in fake encounters. And when the Emergency was declared in June 1975, it was clear- the sun had almost set on the Naxalite movement,” he said. He died in 2010, aged 78, apparently by suicide in Siliguri.\\nOver the years, the CPI(ML) splintered into multiple parties, more than 20 of which still exist. The main CPI(ML) itself gave up armed struggle, expressed faith in the Indian Constitution and began participating in electoral politics. Currently, it is a legally recognised political organisation with several legislators.\\nMeanwhile, in 1980, one of the splinters, the Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) People’s War, was founded by Kondapalli Seetharamayya and Kolluri Chiranjeevi in Andhra Pradesh.\\nAnother major breakaway faction, the Maoist Communist Centre (MCC), had a base in Bihar and West Bengal states. In September 2004, the MCC and CPI(ML) People’s War merged, resulting in the formation of the Communist Party of India (Maoist), the largest armed Maoist organisation in India today.\\nThe organisation’s most recent general secretary, Nambala Keshava Rao, alias Basavaraj, was killed by security forces on Wednesday in Bastar, Chhattisgarh – the last stronghold of Maoists.\\nKanu Sanyal looks on at his home at Hatighisha village near Siliguri, West Bengal, March 21, 2005 [Tamal Roy/AP Photo]\\nHas the BJP intensified the campaign against Maoists?\\nThe BJP-run Chhattisgarh state government has adopted a more aggressive stance against Maoists compared with the previous government led by the Congress party.\\nAt least 141 Maoists were killed between 2020 and 2023, when the Congress party was in power, but after the BJP came to power, security forces claimed to have killed 223 alleged Maoists in 2024 alone, according to government figures.\\n“For the past 15 months, our security personnel have been strongly fighting the Naxals,” Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Vishnu Deo Sai told Al Jazeera.\\n“This action is part of the broader efforts, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, to make India free from Naxalism. This is a decisive phase, and we are advancing rapidly in that direction,” he said.\\nThe security forces have currently surrounded suspected Maoist hideouts in Karigatta Hills, with the army’s helicopters assisting in the operation, according to authorities.\\nWhether it’s the Maoists or the DRG, the one who kills is tribal and the one who dies is also tribal\\nby\\xa0Former Member of Parliament Arvind Netam\\nOn May 14, India’s Home Minister Amit Shah announced the killing of 31 fighters in the Karrigatta Hills.\\n“I once again assure the countrymen that India is sure to be Naxal-free by 31 March 2026,” Shah reiterated in his post on X.\\nOverall, nearly 66,000 security personnel spanning a range of paramilitary and special forces have been deployed in Chhattisgarh.\\nIndia has deployed tens of thousands of forces, including specially trained commandos, in its fight against Maoists [File: Kamal Kishore/Reuters]\\nThe latest operation, which involves more than 10,000 soldiers, centres around the mineral-rich Bastar region of Chhattisgarh, which spans 38,932 square kilometres (15,032sq miles) – an area nearly the size of the US state of Kentucky.\\nThe government has set up approximately 320 security camps in Bastar alone – home to three million people. The number of personnel at each security camp fluctuates depending on the requirement: It can be as low as 150 personnel and rise up to 1,200. They include security forces, as well as technical staff.\\nSecurity camps are often equipped with surveillance and communication equipment to assist in the operation against the rebels. The 20,000-strong local police force is also helping in the operations in Bastar.\\nThe use of cutting-edge technology, such as advanced drones equipped with high-definition cameras and thermal imaging sensors, has helped security forces monitor Maoist activity in the region’s dense forests.\\nHowever, local villagers allege that security forces have carried out aerial bombings in various parts of Bastar using large drones. Maoist groups have also accused the forces of conducting air strikes.\\nSecurity forces have consistently denied these allegations.\\nShah, the home minister, has made frequent visits to Chhattisgarh, even spending nights with security forces in Bastar.\\nBut the federal government of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who preceded Modi in India’s top executive office, had also taken a tough stance against Naxals.\\nSingh even called Naxalism the “greatest internal security threat” to India, and his government launched a major crackdown in 2009 under what it called “Operation Green Hunt” to quash the armed rebellion. Amid allegations of human rights violations, Indian security forces managed to reduce the terrain controlled by the Maoists.\\nIn the 2000s, Naxals controlled nearly one-third of India’s mineral-rich tribal areas, known euphemistically as the Red Corridor, straddling the states of Chhattisgarh, Telangana, Odisha, Jharkhand and Maharashtra, among others. But the number of districts where Maoists wield significant influence had declined from 126 in 2013 to just 38 by April last year.\\nMaoists are watched by villagers as they ready their weapons, while taking part in a training camp in a forested area of Bijapur district in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh on July 8, 2012 [Noah Seelam/AFP]\\nAs the government claims success in its military offensive, human rights groups such as the People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) accuse the security forces of carrying out fake encounters or extrajudicial killings.\\n“A large-scale military campaign is being carried out under the pretext of eliminating Maoists,” Junas Tirkey, the president of the PUCL in Chhattisgarh state, said.\\n“Since 2024, violence, human rights violations, and militarisation have increased sharply in Bastar. Innocent tribals are being killed in fake encounters,” he told Al Jazeera.\\nSince 2024, violence, human rights violations, and militarisation have increased sharply in Bastar. Innocent tribals are being killed in fake encounters\\nby\\xa0 Junas Tirkey, president of the PUCL in Chhattisgarh\\nThe PUCL has identified at least 11 incidents as fake encounters over the past one and a half years.\\nOn March 25, police claimed it had killed Maoist rebels Sudhakar alias Sudhir, Pandru Atra, and Mannu Barsa in Bordga village, Bijapur, about 160km (100 miles) east of Bastar.\\nBut villagers allege the police’s version is false. They claim that the police surrounded the village at night, took 17 people away, released seven, shot three, and took the remaining seven with them.\\nThe government has denied the allegations, but no independent investigation has been conducted in this case. The regular magisterial inquiry, which is carried out after so-called encounters, is not considered credible by rights groups and tribal communities as it is largely based on the police version of events.\\n“It’s true that Sudhakar was a Maoist and came to visit someone in the village. But the police captured Sudhakar, my brother and others alive, took them away, and later shot them, falsely declaring it an encounter,” the brother of Mannu Barsa, Manesh Barsa, told Al Jazeera.\\nInspector general of police of Bastar region, Pattilingam Sundarraj, disagreed with these allegations. He claimed that Maoists often pressure locals to fabricate accusations against the police following encounters.\\nHowever, multiple so-called encounters in Bastar have been proven fake in the past, and in most cases, justice has evaded victims.\\nEven if they are eliminated from Bastar, Maoism is an ideology that cannot be defeated through violence alone\\nby\\xa0Former DGP Vishwaranjan\\nOut of thousands of so-called encounters in Bastar in the last 25 years, only two have faced judicial inquiry. On June 28, 2012, 17 Adivasis, including six minors, were killed in Sarkeguda village in Bijapur district. On May 17, 2013, four minors were among eight Adivasis killed in Edasmeta village in the same district.\\nThe inquiries led by High Court judges found all victims to be innocent. The reports were released in 2022 during the previous Congress rule, though no police cases have been registered against any personnel to date.\\nEven peaceful protests against mining projects and the militarisation of the region have been met with harsh crackdowns.\\nThe Moolvasi Bachao Manch (MBM), led by Adivasis, was banned last year for “opposing development” and “resisting security forces”.\\nDozens of Adivasi youth associated with MBM have been arrested since 2021.\\nWhy is the recruitment of former Maoists in government forces criticised?\\nThe recruitment of Adivasis, many of them former Maoists, in recent years by the authorities seems to have turned the tide in favour of the government.\\nThe then-BJP state government started to incorporate Adivasis, particularly former Maoists, in the District Reserve Guard (DRG) force in 2008 with the aim of using them in anti-Maoist operations. The idea: Former Maoists are better at navigating dense jungle terrain and know about Maoist hideouts.\\nBut past records have raised concerns. Adivasis enlisted as Special Police Officers (SPOs), as they were called, have been accused of rights violations.\\nIn 2005, the state government ruled by the Congress government launched a campaign against Maoists called Salwa Judum (meaning “peace march” in the local Gondi language). Salwa Judum members were armed and were later designated as SPOs and paid 1,500 rupees/month ($17/month).\\nOn one hand, the government itself had proposed dialogue with the Maoists. But now, that same government has turned Bastar into a warzone\\nby\\xa0Soni Sori, Adivasi activist\\nBut Salwa Judum members faced accusations of rape, arson, torture and murder. In 2011, the Supreme Court declared Salwa Judum illegal and slammed the state for arming civilians. Subsequently, many SPOs were absorbed into the DRG.\\nDRG personnel have also been accused of rights abuses, but such cases have rarely been investigated.\\nCampaigners have also questioned the policy of using surrendered Maoists in combat instead of rehabilitating them.\\n“The manner in which SPOs were incorporated into the DRG is disturbing. It shows how tribal youth involved in violence were again handed guns under the pretext of rehabilitation,” lawyer and human rights activist Priyanka Shukla told Al Jazeera.\\nFormer Member of Parliament Arvind Netam believes Bastar is “in a state of civil war”. In a situation like this, he says, it’s the tribals who suffer the most.\\n“Whether it’s the Maoists or the DRG, the one who kills is tribal and the one who dies is also tribal,” Netam, a tribal leader, told Al Jazeera.\\nCampaigners have argued that Chhattisgarh’s new rehabilitation policy, which promises bounties and cash rewards, incentivises people to turn on each other for money, often with allegations that may be legally untenable.\\nWhy has the government resisted calls for a ceasefire?\\nInterestingly, while the government has intensified its offensive, it has also continued to offer peace talks to Maoists.\\n“We still reiterate, Maoists should come forward for dialogue after laying down their arms. Our doors for talks within the framework of the Indian Constitution are always open,” Chhattisgarh’s Home Minister Vijay Sharma told local media last week.\\nThe Maoists, however, insist on a ceasefire and withdrawal of paramilitary forces as conditions for talks. They argue that peace talks and military operations cannot run simultaneously.\\nIn a statement, CPI (Maoist) spokesperson Abhay said, “The right to life guaranteed by the Indian Constitution is being crushed by the government itself … On one hand, our party is trying to initiate unconditional dialogue, and on the other hand, ongoing killings of Maoists and tribals render the peace process meaningless.”\\nActivists have raised concerns regarding the plight of Adivasi communities.\\nSoni Sori, an Adivasi social activist from Bastar, believes the government must take the initiative for peace talks.\\n“On one hand, the government itself had proposed dialogue with the Maoists. But now, that same government has turned Bastar into a warzone,” Sori told Al Jazeera.\\n“Given the way these operations are being conducted, the government should halt them, foster an environment conducive to dialogue, and take meaningful steps toward initiating peace talks.”\\nHuman rights activists, academics and students have been targeted after being dubbed Naxal sympathisers. A 90 percent disabled professor from Delhi University, GN Saibaba was jailed for backing Maoists. Last October, he died months after being acquitted by the country’s top court after a decade of incarceration.\\nBut state Chief Minister Sai says there will be no leniency in this matter. “Naxal eradication is not just a campaign but a mission to secure Bastar and Chhattisgarh’s future,” he said.\\nIs Maoist support declining?\\nIn 2011, then-Director General of Police of Chhattisgarh Vishwaranjan estimated approximately 10,000 armed Maoists and 40,000 militia members in the Bastar region. Accurate numbers are hard to determine.\\nThe rebels were able to carry out deadly attacks against the security forces. In 2010, they killed 76 paramilitary troops in a forest ambush in Chhattisgarh. Three years later, dozens of people, including the Congress leader who founded the Salwa Judum, were killed in a rebel ambush.\\nCurrent Bastar IGP Sundarraj P estimates about 1,000 armed Maoists remain, along with 15,000 affiliated individuals.\\nInternal Maoist reports acknowledge declining recruitment, smaller units, and ammunition shortages. Of the 40 central committee and politburo members, only 18 remain free – the rest are either dead or arrested.\\nMeanwhile, security forces have expanded, built new camps, and improved intelligence and training, while Maoists’ base areas are shrinking.\\nWhile our government is running an anti-Naxal campaign, we are also actively working on development projects\\nby\\xa0Vishnu Deo Sai, chief minister of Chhattisgarh\\nFormer DGP Vishwaranjan says Maoists are weakened in Chhattisgarh, but they have expanded into neighbouring Madhya Pradesh.\\n“Even if they are eliminated from Bastar, Maoism is an ideology that cannot be defeated through violence alone,” he told Al Jazeera.\\n“As long as we build a society on economic inequality, the ideology may resurface in a new form.”\\nDefending his government’s policies, Chief Minister Sai said that “security and development go hand in hand.”\\n“While our government is running an anti-Naxal campaign, we are also actively working on development projects,” he said.\\nIs the real fight over iron ore?\\nNaxals have invoked the exploitation of natural resources, particularly through mining leases issued to global corporations, and the displacement of local communities, as their reasons for picking up guns in mineral-rich areas of the country. Thousands of Adivasis have been displaced and their local environments severely damaged due to mining activities.\\nOf the 51 mineral leases in Bastar, 36 are held by private firms, including global steel major ArcelorMittal.\\nFormer MLA and tribal leader Manish Kunjam echoes a similar sentiment, arguing, “The real issue is iron ore.”\\nAccording to the Indian government, 19 percent of the country’s iron ore reserves are in Chhattisgarh, mainly in Bastar.\\nChhattisgarh accounts for 18 percent of India’s railway freight revenue, largely from mineral transport – and this is growing.\\nKunjam explained that when the corporations Tata and Essar began their projects in 2005 to mine iron ore, the state launched Salwa Judum, evacuating 644 villages under the pretext of Maoist fear. At least 350,000 people were displaced. However, strong tribal resistance forced the companies to withdraw.\\n“Learning from that failure, the government has now set up security camps in mining zones, preparing for renewed extraction,” he said.\\n“Without village council approval, mining cannot proceed. If tribals protest, they will be labelled as Maoists or sympathisers and dealt with accordingly.”\\nA closer look at his claims reveals that most camps are indeed in areas where mining has begun or is about to. In Bastar’s mining belt, there is one soldier for every nine tribals. Many of these camps are funded by mining companies.\\nBut Chief Minister Sai believes that the mineral resources in tribal areas should be utilised.\\nThe idea of generating revenue at the cost of tribal lives is dangerous and unconstitutional\\nby\\xa0Sushil Anand Shukla, opposition Congress party spokesperson\\n“The lives of tribals will change with the beginning of mining and industrial activities,” he said. He boasted that Chhattisgarh ranks second among mineral-producing states [after Odisha], earning approximately 14.19 billion rupees ($1.71bn) last year.\\nThis year, the state has allocated 48 major mineral blocks to private companies in the state.\\nBut mass poverty and lack of basic health facilities expose the government’s claims.\\nNetam, the tribal leader, pointed out that the state has an infant mortality rate of nearly 38 per 1,000 live births, compared to the national infant mortality rate of 28 per 1,000 live births.\\nIn Bastar, he said, poverty is 80 percent.\\nThe opposition Congress spokesperson Sushil Anand Shukla claimed that under the guise of mining, preparations were under way to completely displace tribals from Bastar.\\n“Today, Bastar stands on the brink of war, and its answers cannot be found by looking to the past. The government must stop surrendering to corporate houses and mining companies at the cost of evicting tribals,” Sushil Anand Shukla says.\\n“The idea of generating revenue at the cost of tribal lives is dangerous and unconstitutional,” he told Al Jazeera.\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

To understand why, visit Birmingham](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/21/workers-labour-birmingham-bin-strike-ministers) (#32926)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 14:01:41+00:00\\n\\n```\\nSix months ago, it was a stirring, a mood felt in many workers’ meetings, on picket lines and doorsteps. What started as disappointment in Labour is now giving way to anger for many British workers and their communities. “Aren’t Labour supposed to be for workers?” is a line I hear daily now. Most recently, this sentiment has been felt in Birmingham, where bin workers for the Labour-run city council have been on indefinite strike since 11 March.These workers woke up one morning to be told they would lose up to a quarter of their pay – what Unite believes to be up to £8,000. This is “fire-and-rehire” by any other name. Bin lorry drivers are now being told they are next in line to lose the same amount in pay. What makes this scandal all the more egregious is that it is being perpetrated by a Labour council – enthusiastically backed by a Labour government. One bin worker said this government “might be Labour in name, but it isn’t Labour in nature”.That specific is mirrored in much more general conceptions. Labour voters can’t believe that this government would, with almost its first act, cut the winter fuel allowance for pensioners, regardless of the U-turn it has now made. Then it attacked those on welfare benefits. Why would a Labour administration target some of the country’s most vulnerable people instead of making the rich pay more, through a real wealth tax? Unite research shows that the assets of the richest 50 families in the UK are worth £500bn. That’s more than the wealth of a third of Britain. A 1% tax on the richest 1% would raise £25bn. Labour in name but not in nature is right.And nothing is more symbolic of Labour’s disconnection from its core mission than the catastrophe of the Birmingham bin strike. Angela Rayner, Labour MPs, and the leader of Birmingham city council, John Cotton, who incidentally has not attended one single negotiation on the bin strike, have spent weeks, if not months, demanding that our members should simply accept “the fair and reasonable offer on the table”. The problem is there isn’t one.I’ve seen this charade play out week after week since the strike began: Unite decision-makers are in the room with a group of council employees who clearly do not have the power to make any decisions. Hence, there have been no real negotiations and certainly no settlement of the dispute.When Acas conciliation was suggested, I said I would be there in person and that I expected the leader of the council to do the same. After all, he had said in public just days before that “nobody needs to lose any pay” – surely we should have been in touching distance of a deal? But Cotton, once again, did not turn up to the talks, sending Joanne Roney, the managing director of the city council instead, who introduced herself as a decision-maker. I asked for a copy of the “fair and reasonable offer”, but yet again, none was produced.Both Rayner and Cotton have cited lump sums in the thousands being put on the table, together with moves that would result in no loss of pay. None of this was seen at Acas. Nonetheless, the talks began, and a “ballpark” deal was discussed, one that could finally be taken back to workers to ballot. That was on the 6 May. Roney said she would send a written draft by 8 May, but at the time of writing, we have yet to receive the offer. A simple written offer dictating terms.So why the delay? The government’s own commissioners – who have been in place since just after the council effectively declared itself bankrupt in 2023 – are now apparently blocking the deal, despite Rayner previously claiming central government has “no part in the decision-making of the dispute”. Roney is reportedly being prevented from putting in writing what we discussed at conciliation unless they agree to it. Of course, this is what Unite has been saying all along: Birmingham city council’s decision-makers are simply not in the room.In 35 years of negotiating huge disputes, I have never seen such a shambles. Our members can see through Labour’s spin. How can a Labour council be doing this to their own workers? What happened to the “change” promised by Starmer? Make no mistake, these workers have the full backing of Unite. Losing up to a quarter of their pay means many won’t be able to pay mortgages or rent, or cover other basic living costs. This cannot be allowed to happen.How can a Labour council and a Labour government preside over these pay cuts and say with a straight face that they are the party of workers? The recent local election results are a warning to Labour that the anger is becoming more widespread.

For some of these people, it\\'s a quarter of their pay,\" she added.Ms Graham later told BBC Radio WM that the process was like \"blancmange\". She said: \"I feel appalled for the people of Birmingham because of how they\\'ve been let down.\"ReutersMs Graham also claims the city council has failed to present a promised pay offerA spokesperson for the council said the authority was committed to seeking a negotiated settlement to end the dispute.However, in a message sent to Unite via the conciliation service Acas last week that was seen by the BBC, the authority said \"it would not be in a position to make further offers to settle this dispute until we have cleared all necessary commissioner and constitutional approvals and we anticipate this will take up to seven days\".\\'Monumental governance disasters\\'Council sources told the BBC\\'s Rob Mayor that did not amount to any blocking of a deal as claimed by Unite, but simply that there needed to be time for proper due diligence into any proposals.\"They stress that the authority is an organisation which has seen it\\'s reputation shredded by a series of monumental governance and financial disasters, leading to it\\'s effective bankruptcy in 2023,\" the sources said. \"They say it would be foolhardy not to follow measures, like the oversight of government commissioners, which were put in place to ensure those mistakes are not made again.\"They said: \"Our focus has been to find a solution to this that does not put the council in a position that compromises us financially or legally. This is why we are committed to making a revised offer.\"It also defended the commissioners and said they were also \"fully supportive\" of finding a solution to the strike.A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson called on Unite to suspend strike action and urged both parties to \"reach agreement on a fair and reasonable offer\".Industrial action has been ongoing since January, when bin workers began a series of walkouts.That escalated into an all-out strike, now in its eleventh week.At one point, there were estimated to be 21,000 tonnes of rubbish on Birmingham\\'s streets and there have been queues of up to a mile at mobile collection points.The city council has previously defended its job evaluation process as \"fair and transparent\" and said it was \"working hard\" to reach a settlement.Unite was itself previously accused of scuppering a potential deal, a claim which it denied.\\'£8,000 pay cut\\'Meanwhile, the council said very few of its waste lorries were deployed on Wednesday morning due to picketing outside its three depots.In a post on X, the authority apologised for the disruption and said people\\'s bins would be collected as soon as possible.It came after protesters supporting the striking bin workers disrupted a ceremony to mark the election of Birmingham\\'s new Lord Mayor.Mayor Zafar Iqbal took up the role on Tuesday but the event saw shouts from the public gallery including one woman angrily yelling: \"Could you take an £8,000 pay cut?\"The outgoing Lord Mayor, Ken Wood, shouted back at them to sit down before asking for the gallery to be cleared.More on this storyRelated internet links\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

The company scaled back many diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in January after they came under attack by conservative activists and the White House. Target\\'s retreat created another backlash, with more customers angered by the retailer\\'s reduction of LGBTQ+-themed merchandise for Pride Month in June of 2023. Shares fell 3% before the opening bell Wednesday.Sales fell 2.8% to $23.85 billion in the quarter, and that was short of the $24.23 billion Wall Street expected, according to FactSet. Sales are also down from the $24.53 billion the company reported during the same period last year.Target cut its annual sales projections Wednesday. The company now expects a low-single digit decline for 2025 after projecting a 1% increase for sales in March. It also forecast annual per-share earnings of $7 to $9, excluding gains from legal settlements this year.For the year, analysts expect earnings per share of $8.34 on sales of $106.7 billion.Comparable store sales, those from established stores and online channels, fell 3.8%. That includes a 5.7% drop in store sales and a 4.7% increase in online sales. That reverses a comparable store sales increase of 1.5% in the previous quarter.The number of transactions across online and physical stores fell 2.4%, and the average ticket dropped 1.4%. Target said Tuesday that it couldn’t reliably estimate the individual impact of each of the factors that were hurting its business. Target is setting up a new office to be led by Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke would focus on making faster decisions to help accelerate sales growth. Current Chief Strategy and Growth Officer Christina Hennington will move into a strategic adviser role.Target is also intensifying efforts to entice customers who are nervous about the economy and inflation. The retailer says it is offering 10,000 new items starting at $1 — with the majority under $20.“I want to be clear,” Target CEO Brian Cornell told reporters on a call Tuesday. “We’re not satisfied with these results, so we’re moving with urgency to navigate through this period of volatility ... We’ve got to drive traffic back into our stores or visits to our site.”Out of 35 merchandise categories including discretionary and essentials that the company tracks, it’s gaining or maintaining market share in only 15, the company said. The company cited that there were some market share gains in women’s swimwear, infant and toddler clothing, and active wear. The latest results underscore Target\\'s ongoing struggle in recent years to revive sales particularly in nonessentials like fashion and home furnishings as competition grows more fierce with the likes of Walmart and Amazon. Target\\'s shares have fallen more than 37% in the past 52 weeks.Target rival Walmart reported strong quarterly sales last week. The nation’s largest retailer said it\\'s already raised prices on some items due to tariffs and that more price hikes are on the way this summer when the back-to-school shopping season goes into high gear. For example, car seats made in China that currently sell for $350 at Walmart will likely cost customers another $100, executives said. Target didn’t offer specifics on tariffs’ impact on prices, but said that it was looking at different ways to offset those costs.“We look at competition,” Cornell told reporters. “We make adjustments literally each and every week, so we’re constantly adjusting pricing. Some are going up. Some will be reduced.”President Donald Trump’s threatened 145% import taxes on Chinese goods were reduced to 30% in a deal announced May 12, with some of the higher tariffs on pause for 90 days.Yet Americans were already pulling back on spending as they grow increasingly uneasy over the state of the U.S. economy. Companies including toy manufacturer Mattel, toolmaker Stanley Black & Decker and consumer products giant Procter & Gamble have announced higher prices or plans to raise prices because of the trade war kicked of by the U.S. Walmart was able to dodge some of the tariff damage other retailers are suffering because groceries account for about 60% of its U.S. business. Target is more reliant on discretionary items like clothing and accessories, with less than a quarter of its sales coming from groceries. Target has reduced the number of its store-label products sourced from China to 30% now from 60% in 2017. The company is on its way to reducing that number to 25% by the end of next year, the company said. Target is shifting sourcing to Guatemala and Honduras and is looking to sourcing in the U.S.Target is being pressured on other fronts as well. The company in January said it would phase out a handful of DEI initiatives, including a program designed to help Black employees advance their careers and promote Black-owned businesses. Conservative activists and President Donald Trump have sought to dismantle DEI policies in the federal government, schools, and at private businesses.The pastor of a Georgia megachurch who led a nationwide 40-day boycott of Target stores in response called last month for a continuation of that effort.The Rev. Jamal Bryant is seeking a reinvigorated commitment from Target on diversity, and he wants more support from Target for Black-owned banks and businesses.Target earned $1.04 billion, or $2.27 per share, for the period ended May 3. That compares with $942 million, or $2.03 per share, in the year-ago period.Target operates nearly 2,000 stores nationwide and employs more than 400,000 people.\\n```\\n\\n## [Target calls tariff price hikes a last resort](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/target-tariff-price-hikes-last-resort-rcna208004) (#30697)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 12:28:54+00:00\\n\\n```\\nRaising prices on consumers to cover the costs of President Donald Trump\\'s tariffs will be Target\\'s \"very last resort,\" CEO Brian Cornell said Wednesday.The remarks came as Target reported weaker-than-expected sales in its first quarter and cut its full-year forecast. The retailer, whose business hasn’t fared as well against rivals better known for bargain prices, has “many levers to use in mitigating the impact of tariffs,” Cornell said.Major retailers appear to be treading cautiously around the question of price hikes after Trump slammed Walmart last weekend for warning that shoppers could pay more due to tariffs. In the days since, Target, Lowe’s and Home Depot have each made carefully worded remarks about the potential for higher prices or minimized discussion of tariffs altogether.Walmart said last week that it customers would likely start seeing some prices climb as soon as this month because tariffs have created a more “challenging environment to operate in.” While presidents typically avoid appearing to dictate individual companies’ strategies, Trump castigated Walmart on his social media platform, demanding that it “EAT THE TARIFFS” and adding, “I’ll be watching, and so will your customers!!!”“We’ll keep prices as low as we can for as long as we can given the reality of small retail margins,” Walmart told NBC News Saturday in response to Trump\\'s post. Days later, Home Depot all but ruled out near-term price hikes, citing its scale and supply-chain arrangements. Lowe\\'s barely mentioned tariffs when it reported earnings Wednesday but said just 20% of what its shoppers buy now comes from China, after years of diversifying its sourcing.For Target, Cornell emphasized that tariffs were just one factor in a series of “massive potential costs” the company is grappling with. He pointed to consumer uncertainty over the direction of the economy and a high-profile backlash over Target\\'s watering down of its diversity, equity and inclusion policies. The retailer had expanded those initiatives after police murdered George Floyd in its hometown, Minneapolis, five years ago this weekend.Target has rolled out discounts over the past year to lure inflation-weary shoppers and touted plans to expand its third-party marketplace to offer a broader range of items. To deal with new trade policy challenges, it\\'s negotiating with vendors, reassessing its product lineup and adjusting its foreign supply chain, Chief Commercial Officer Rick Gomez told investors Wednesday.\"Half of what we sell comes from the U.S.,\" he said, adding that Target is expanding production in the United States and in other countries outside of China, whose exports currently face a 30% import tax.Target\\'s stock was trading more than 3% lower late Wednesday morning.Some major companies that sell products at leading retailers have raised prices or said they’re considering doing so, including toolmaker Stanley Black & Decker, consumer products giant Procter & Gamble, sportswear brand Adidas and toy maker Mattel.Mattel, the maker of Barbie dolls, has also come under fire from Trump, who threatened to hit it with 100% tariffs this month, after it signaled price hikes were on the table.Big companies generally have more latitude to handle cost increases and other economic headwinds than their smaller counterparts. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and independent business owners have warned that tariffs threaten to snuff out many small operators, chipping away at the competition for already large corporate rivals.The National Retail Federation, which represents some of the biggest retailers in the country, has emphasized that risk in lobbying against new levies. “Small and medium-sized businesses will be disproportionately affected by the tariffs, with\\u202fmany saying\\u202fthey will have to raise prices or shut down,” it says on its website.So far, “consumers are still spending despite widespread pessimism fueled by rising tariffs,” NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz said in a statement last week after retail sales eked out a modest 0.1% rise in April. But even the largest multinational companies aren’t insulated from tariff-driven uncertainty, the NFR and industry analysts say. Like Target, several large firms have revised or scrapped their financial outlooks in recent weeks, unsure how the White House’s trade agenda will affect them.Not every retailer is voicing tariff jitters. The parent company of T.J. Maxx and Marshalls beat sales estimates Wednesday and maintained its full-year forecast. The discounter, which buys unsold merchandise from other brands that have already paid tariffs on much of it, said it expects to be able to handle the pressure from higher import taxes.Sportswear brand Canada Goose, which makes popular winter jackets, also exceeded Wall Street expectations. But it joined the slew of companies pulling their forecasts for the rest of the year, citing an “unpredictable global trade environment.”Steve KopackSteve Kopack is a producer at NBC News covering business and the economy.J.J.

Target now expects a “low-single digit decline” in sales this year, down from a projection a few months ago of a small gain.The gloomy forecast set Target apart from some of its competitors that have in recent days maintained their outlooks, even while warning of the risks and uncertainty generated by President Trump’s tariffs.Comparable sales at Target last quarter, which ended May 3, fell 3.8 percent from a year earlier, reflecting both lower foot traffic and less spent per visit. The retailer’s stock fell roughly 6 percent in early trading as investors digested the weaker-than-expected report.“We’re not satisfied with this performance,” Brian Cornell, Target’s chief executive, said on a call with analysts. The report was the latest evidence that the retailer’s effort to rebound from a difficult 2024 — a year marked by inconsistent sales growth and a tumbling stock price — has yet to materialize.A “highly challenging environment” dragged down Target’s financial results, it said; retailers across the board are navigating tariff-fueled cost increases and dampened consumer sentiment.Price increases in response to tariffs have taken center stage as major U.S. retailers report their latest earnings. When Walmart said last week that it would raise prices for some products because of tariffs, the company faced swift public backlash from Mr. Trump, who called on social media for the company to “EAT THE TARIFFS.” Mattel, the toy company, faced similar ire earlier this month.That has put retailers like Home Depot and Target, which both reported quarterly earnings this week, in a tricky position, with investors expecting the companies to detail their pricing plans and executives weighing potential backlash from Washington. Home Depot went out of its way on Tuesday to emphasize that its prices would “generally” hold steady.Target executives on Wednesday pointed to several strategies the company is employing to minimize the impact of tariffs. The plans include working with vendors and suppliers to keep prices low, changing inventory, adjusting the timing for some orders, diversifying its sources of production and “where necessary, adjusting prices,” said Rick Gomez, Target’s chief commercial officer.“Price is the very last resort,” Mr. Cornell said on a call with analysts. Home Depot echoed a similar position on pricing, adding on a call with analysts Tuesday it could gain market share from rivals. “We don’t see broad-based price increases for our customers at all going forward,” said Billy Bastek, head of merchandising for the home improvement retailer.The comments came after Walmart’s warning last week that Mr. Trump’s tariffs would push the company to start raising prices soon.Target relies more heavily on discretionary items like electronics than some of its competitors — for example, Walmart’s well-trafficked grocery aisles — noted Steven Shemesh, a retail analyst at RBC Capital Markets. That poses a challenge for Target, given that many discretionary goods are imported and might be less popular as shoppers focus on buying essential items, he said.Both Walmart and Home Depot reaffirmed their full-year financial forecasts, despite the likelihood that tariffs would raise costs for certain products. That put Target in a difficult spot heading into its earnings report, Mr. Shemesh said.“If you’re Target and you don’t reaffirm, you by default look worse than Walmart,” he added. On Wednesday, Lowe’s, the home improvement retailer, reaffirmed its full-year guidance, too.As part of its turnaround push, Target said it would create a new “acceleration office,” aimed at streamlining operations and speeding up decisions. “In today’s environment, we need to become more agile and move with greater speed,” said Michael Fiddelke, Target’s chief operating officer, who is set to lead the office.On top of tariffs and shaky consumer confidence, Target is also dealing with the fallout from its retreat from diversity practices. Customers denounced Target’s decision in January to pull back on these policies, noting that the retailer had long been viewed as a friendly environment that sold and highlighted merchandise from many minority communities. Several groups have called on shoppers to boycott Target, and foot traffic to its stores fell 2.4 percent last quarter, after growing in the previous three quarters.Danielle Kaye is a Times business reporter and a 2024 David Carr Fellow, a program for journalists early in their careers.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

It\\'s more or less a perfect case for a high-end build that isn\\'t a completely custom design.Image 1 of 4(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)Next, the IRONMOUSE VTuber-themed PC build with IRONMOUSE-branded components looked fantastic, and is the kind of build and component design that should inspire a lot of builders out there to go for a similar look.(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)Obviously, graphics cards were a big part of MSI\\'s booth this year, and that makes sense, seeing as it consistently makes some of the best graphics cards on the market, especially on the higher end of the stack, like the MSI GeForce RTX 5090 Suprim Liquid SOC, but also smaller form factor cards on the lower end of the stack like the new MSI GeForce RTX 5060 Ti Inspire 2X OC.(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)Of course, with so many components, you could build a whole PC out of just MSI parts, and MSI went out of its way to showcase some of its DIY innovations that aim to make PC building easier and less intimidating for first-time builders.(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)In addition to its mainstream graphics card lineup, MSI also showed off new MSI GeForce RTX 5080 Expert OC and RTX 4080 Super Expert OC cards with a cool-looking grill design built into their shrouds.Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Image 1 of 4(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)There were also some awesome special edition cards being shown off, like the MSI GeForce RTX 5070 Cyclone Visual OC, which is a single, large-fan design that has an LCD display in the center.(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)Of course, there was also the MSI GeForce RTX 5090 Suprim Titanium Edition SOC card with a lux golden-colored finish. How much this card would set you back I can\\'t say, but I can\\'t imagine it\\'s cheap even by RTX 5090 standards.(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)But the component that really stole my heart at the MSI booth yesterday was a simple bracket, one that I\\'m not even sure you\\'d be able to buy on its own, but which would come with the MSI MPG Coreliquid P13 360 AIO cooler.(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)See, here\\'s the thing. I test a lot of processors for my reviews and features, and this often involves me swapping out motherboards with different chipsets. But in order to keep results comparable between Intel and AMD processors, I really need everything else on the testbench to stay the same, including the AIO cooler.The problem, though, is that the mounting for CPU coolers between AMD and Intel isn\\'t standardized. Instead, both chipmakers have their mounting screws oriented differently. Intel\\'s CPU cooler mountings form a square, while AMD\\'s form a rectangle with uneven length and height.This means that I have to swap out the mounting bracket for the AIO cooler every time I switch between the two chip brands, and losing one of those brackets is an absolute nightmare that could wreck days of testing. I know this because it\\'s happened to me more than once.(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)Enter the MSI Unibracket. A single bracket that works with both Intel LGA 1700/1851 and AMD AM4/AM5 motherboard mountings.As soon as I saw the Unibracket, I wanted to scream, because the solution to the problem is so blindingly obvious, I don\\'t understand how this part isn\\'t standardized across every CPU cooler manufacturer.Their loss is MSI\\'s gain, however, as once I get a Coreliquid P13 360 AIO cooler in the lab, it\\'s all but guaranteed to be my go-to CPU cooler for the testbench for the foreseeable future.You might also like...The MSI Prestige 13+ AI Ukiyo-e Edition is nothing short of a work of art, and my only complaint is that so few people will get to see it in personBest laptops of Computex 2025 - meet the future of notebooks from HP, Asus, and moreMSI\\'s new AI-infused QD-OLED monitor and improved MEG Vision X AI gaming PC make AI a bit more practical for gamers\\nJohn (He/Him) is the Components Editor here at TechRadar and he is also a programmer, gamer, activist, and Brooklyn College alum currently living in Brooklyn, NY.

AMD has unveiled its Ryzen Threadripper 9000 Series \"Shimada Peak\" processors, featuring up to 96 Zen 5 cores and 192 threads. Targeted at the workstation and high-end desktop markets, the new lineup can reportedly deliver up to 2.2 times the performance of competing Intel Xeon chips.\\nDesigned for the xTR5 socket, the Shimada Peak platform includes two distinct families: the Threadripper Pro 9000 WX and the non-Pro Threadripper 9000 Series. The Pro lineup features six SKUs, headlined by the 9995WX, which offers 96 cores and 192 threads. It comes with a 2.5GHz base clock, a 5.4GHz boost clock, and 384MB of L3 cache.\\nThe other SKUs in the Pro lineup include the 9985WX with 64 cores and 128 threads, the 9975WX with 32 cores and 64 threads, the 9965WX with 24 cores and 48 threads, the 9955WX with 16 cores and 32 threads, and the 9945WX with 12 cores and 24 threads. Interestingly, the entry-level 9945WX features the highest base clock at 4.7GHz.\\nAll Pro models offer a maximum boost frequency of up to 5.4GHz, support up to 128 PCIe 5.0 lanes, and carry a 350W TDP. They also support 8-channel DDR5-6400 ECC memory.\\nThe Threadripper 9000 (non-Pro) family includes three SKUs: the 9980X with 64 cores and 128 threads, the 9970X with 32 cores and 64 threads, and the 9960X with 24 cores and 48 threads. The flagship 9980X features a 3.2GHz base clock, a 5.4GHz boost clock, and 256MB of L3 cache. All models support quad-channel DDR5-6400 memory and carry a 350W TDP.\\nAccording to AMD, the new processors deliver up to 22 percent better performance in threaded workloads compared to the previous generation. This gain is likely due to the transition from Zen 4 to Zen 5 architecture, as well as the shift from a 5nm to a 4nm process node for the compute dies. The chips also support AVX-512 instructions, which can significantly boost performance in compatible applications.\\nThe Threadripper family is built for professional workloads such as AI development, 3D modeling, and ultra-high-resolution video editing. The processors will be available starting July 2025 for DIY builders, as well as in prebuilt workstations from leading OEMs including Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Supermicro.\\nAMD has yet to announce pricing, but based on the MSRPs of the Threadripper 7000 Series, these chips are unlikely to be affordable for most enthusiasts or DIY hobbyists. The previous generation started at $1,400 for the entry-level SKU and topped out at a staggering $10,000 for the flagship model.\\n```\\n\\n## [MSI’s Lime-Colored Claw A8 Will Make You Forget About the Missing Xbox Handheld](https://gizmodo.com/msis-lime-colored-claw-a8-will-make-you-forget-about-the-missing-xbox-handheld-2000605050) (#35367)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 13:45:10+00:00\\n\\n```\\nMSI\\'s latest Claw A8 handheld PC already has us anticipating a hot year in handhelds beyond the Switch 2.\\nWithout any sign of that rumored Xbox handheld, the Computex computing conference in Taipei, Taiwan has been missing out on what’s now one of the best avenues for gaming on the go—handheld PCs. MSI is now posing as the lone figure promoting a whole new class of handhelds with the Claw A8. It’s a device that looks very, very close to what we’ve seen before—even in blinding lime green—but it may offer a glimpse of what’s in store for handhelds beyond the Nintendo Switch 2, even though we still don’t know how much it will cost. The Claw A8 comes in two colors—a white and a very, very green hue. The shell looks familiar if you’ve seen MSI’s other handhelds, and if you didn’t know the device contained an 8-inch 120Hz IPS display with variable refresh rate, you may have assumed it was the original Asus ROG Ally or even a white version of the Claw 7 A1M. Unlike last year’s Claw 8 AI+, the new handheld includes more severe, squared-off edges. That doesn’t necessarily mean it’s uncomfortable. MSI said it designed the device’s underside grips to make it easier to hold while still letting your fingers reach the front thumbsticks and face buttons. The Claw A8’s controls include Hall effect joysticks, which should make the device last longer without the usual fear of stick drift. © MSI The other big difference between this device and last year’s iteration is the CPU. The Claw A8 is one of the few of its kind confirmed to house an AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme. That chip is a sequel to the Ryzen Z1, one of the most-used handheld CPUs from the last two years. The new CPU is built on the chipmaker’s Zen 5 microarchitecture, bringing it in line with AMD’s latest family of Strix Point laptop CPUs. It’s also supposed to offer far better graphics potential than its predecessor. We’ve seen the chip running with a few games on an early version of the Lenovo Legion Go 2, but without our own tests, we can only speculate on just how much better it will be over similar devices you can buy today.\\nMSI’s Claw A8 is a confusing name if you’ve heard of the company’s previous flagship handheld, the Claw 8 AI+. That device was a beast in terms of performance, not the least because it contained an Intel Core Ultra 7 258V, a full laptop CPU that used Intel’s Arc 140V graphics. That meant the device was far more hefty than the competition, but it offered solid performance for its $1,000 price (the cost has gone up since release, but you’ll be lucky to find it available anyway). The Claw 8 AI+ also holds the edge in memory compared to the A8. The new handheld has a max of 24GB of RAM with a slower 8,000MHz speed compared to the 8 AI+’s 8,533MHz. At least the squatter handheld will weigh a little less than the last generation’s bulky frame. MSI moving to AMD It seems less a betrayal and more an acknowledgement that there’s a benefit to a dedicated gaming CPU designed specifically for a device of this size. A laptop chip is simply built to handle more productivity tasks. Intel also seems to know it’s missing out on this space. The chipmaker recently told Laptop Mag it was working on handheld-specific CPUs.\\nPC-class gaming, now in your hands. Pre-order the new Lenovo Legion Go S with Steam OS at https://t.co/3jqjW1logY pic.twitter.com/5qb5nyzcTn — Lenovo Legion (@LenovoLegion) March 28, 2025 There hasn’t been too much news about gaming handhelds in the months following CES 2025 in January. Lenovo opened up the year with the Legion Go S, a lower-powered handheld with Windows 11, and the still-unreleased Legion Go 2 with the Ryzen Z2 Extreme. That device with its brand-specific AMD Ryzen Z2 Go chip didn’t knock our socks off, especially for its price, but we have a feeling a lower price that edges closer to the $550 Steam Deck OLED, combined with the console-like experience of SteamOS, will make it a much better handheld experience. That Legion Go S with SteamOS should be available May 25 for $600 with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. The gaming elephant still stomping around this crowded room is the Nintendo Switch 2. Those who want to get into Nintendo’s sequel system for $450 may not want to drop even more money on a separate handheld. Nintendo’s impending June 5 release date seems like a good excuse for both Asus and Lenovo to hold off on a more expensive, more powerful console until later. We should hear more about pricing in the following months. By that time, we’ll be so overwhelmed with handhelds we’ll need to grow more hands to try them all.\\n```\\n\\n## [MSI\\'s Claw A8 handheld supports AMD and Intel inside.

It’s a big choice for PC gamers, but if you want a handheld, only one company will let you choose. With the new Claw A8, MSI is the only major vendor that’s offering handheld gaming PCs with guts from the blue and red teams. At Computex, Adam Patrick Murray cornered MSI Product Management Director Cliff Chun to talk about it.\\nThough the body is more angular, the newer version of the Claw is broadly similar to the existing Claw 8 AI+, with the same 8-inch, 120Hz screen, same basic layout, same battery. It has a new motherboard and cooling setup, of course, due to using the brand new AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme mobile chip. But if anything that makes the new version just more similar to existing handhelds that have popped up since the Steam Deck.\\nChun says that MSI is focusing on giving players maximum battery life, while keeping most games at a 60 frames-per-second level. That battery life is an estimated two hours, which isn’t exactly amazing when compared to laptops running on similar hardware…but laptops have bigger batteries and aren’t 100 percent focused on gaming. The speakers have been moved up a bit, but aren’t blocked by your hands when held, according to MSI.\\nMSI will still sell both the Claw 8 AI+ and the original 7-inch model, all based on Intel and all running Windows, when the A8 releases later this year. We don’t have pricing information at the moment, and Chun is mum on any developments for a handheld running SteamOS, like the upcoming Lenovo Legion Go S.

The silver metal look with ocean-blue LED accents immediately makes me think of a spaceship, but in a good way. It\\'s like you pulled this GPU out of a Starfleet vessel, and I\\'ll take that kind of build any day of the week.ASRock Arc Pro B60 Passive(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)It\\'s not very often you get to see a passively cooled graphics card in 2025, and so the ASRock Arc Pro B60 Passive card caught my eye almost immediately. I haven\\'t tested the Arc Pro B60, so I have no idea how much power it draws and whether passive cooling would be enough to keep the card functioning at peak performance, but it\\'s always good to see different ways of doing things, and passive cooling is always pretty cool, at least in principle.Zotac GeForce RTX 5060 Low-profile(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)Usually, low-profile discrete GPUs are just a PCB and maybe a heatsink, as there\\'s very little room to put much else on a form factor so small, but the Zotac RTX 5060 Low Profile GPU manages to squeeze three fans onto a very slim card, making it a perfect GPU for small case designs.You might also like...Next-gen laptops, bonkers PCs, and too much AI: here\\'s what I expect to see at Computex 2025Best laptops of Computex 2025 – meet the future of notebooks from HP, Asus, and moreThe MSI Prestige 13+ AI Ukiyo-e Edition is nothing short of a work of art, and my only complaint is that so few people will get to see it in person\\nJohn (He/Him) is the Components Editor here at TechRadar and he is also a programmer, gamer, activist, and Brooklyn College alum currently living in Brooklyn, NY.

You\\'ll see everything from high-powered CPUs to ergonomic keyboards.\\nBest Desktop CPU: AMD Threadripper 9000\\nAlex Dobie / How-To Geek\\nNick: When performance is a must and dollars aren\\'t a concern, some of the best prosumer CPUs you can buy are AMD\\'s Threadripper CPUs, which are cut down variants of their EPYC Server CPUs.\\nThe new Threadripper 9000 Series comes in a few variants, with the most impressive packing a whopping 64 cores with 128 threads. In a pinch, it can boost its core clock up to 5.4GHz. If you\\'re willing to shell out the money, it supports up to 1 terabyte of RAM.\\nHowever, these CPUs aren’t just for gaming. They’re designed for extremely demanding workflows, like visual effects, complex physical simulations, and working with AI models.\\nThey’ll go on sale in July 2025, but no word on their price yet. Their predecessors cost anywhere between $1,500 and $5,000, and I’d expect these to be a couple hundred dollars more.\\nBest Handheld PC: MSI Claw A8\\nAlex Dobie / How-To Geek\\nJordan: Handheld PCs are increasingly stealing the limelight at computer trade shows, from the Steam Deck to the ROG Ally. At Computex this year, it\\'s the MSI Claw A8 (BZ2EM). Alongside a refresh to the Claw 8 AI+ we saw at IFA last year, the A8 is the first handheld on the scene to use the AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme, a chip designed specifically for handhelds. We have big expectations for the Z2 Extreme, so we\\'re excited to see it finally showing up for playtesting.\\nThat Ryzen processor powers a 1080p display panel hitting refresh rates of 120Ghz, and it operates on 24GB of RAM. The Claw A8 draws its energy from an 80Wh battery, and it weighs in at almost 27 ounces, a little bit heavier than the Steam Deck\\'s 23.6-ounce heft. Speaking of the Steam Deck, one problem still holding the Claw back is its steadfast support of Windows over SteamOS. We\\'re not huge fans of Windows on handhelds, and some competitors have moved onto supporting SteamOS.\\nStill, we\\'re looking forward to when the Claw A8 arrives in stores, presumably later this year. MSI hasn\\'t announced a price yet either, but considering the price point of other Claw units, we\\'re expecting it to break $1,000.\\nBest Laptop: HP OmniBook 5 16\\nRich Woods / XDA Developers / How-To Geek\\nJoe: Most people’s idea of a “perfect” laptop is one that balances affordability, sleek design, performance, and endurance. That\\'s what HP is aiming for with their new OmniBook 5 series, available in 14-inch or 16-inch models. These laptops come equipped with a 1920 x 1200 OLED display, up to 32GB of RAM, and user-replaceable storage. However, the biggest selling point might be battery life. They\\'re powered by the energy-efficient Qualcomm Snapdragon X series processors, and HP claims they’ll provide up to 34 hours of local video playback.\\nWhile HP is positioning these as budget-friendly laptops, starting at just $799 in July, you\\'re still getting a premium feel with aluminum bodies and thin profiles. Both the 14-inch and 16-inch models feature 59 Wh batteries, 1080p IR webcams with privacy shutters, and a solid array of ports including two USB-C 3.2 and one USB-A 3.2. The USB-C ports support 65W charging. You\\'ll also find WiFi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 for wireless connectivity.\\nBest Monitor: MSI MPG 271QR QD-OLED X50\\nMSI\\nNick: If you’re in the market for a stunning gaming monitor, look no further than MSI’s MPG 271QR QD-OLED X50.\\nThe monitor boasts a 1440p resolution, which is increasingly popular, and an eye-watering 500Hz refresh rate—high enough for even the most discerning gamers to be satisfied. To finish it all off, the display is QD-OLED, which means you’ll be able to expect vibrant colors and exceptional contrast. That combination of features makes it a monitor as well suited to competitive games like Counterstrike (where refresh rate can provide a small edge) as to games that are more cinematic, which lean more heavily on color and contrast.\\nTo reduce the risk of burn in, MSI has added an “AI Care Sensor,” which will detect when you’re at your PC and power down when no one is around. It also comes with the standard OLED Care 2.0 features, which shifts pixels around and triggers a periodic “pixel refresh” every 16 hours.\\nIt goes on sale on July 17th for $899.\\nBest Motherboard: ASUS ROG Crosshair x870E Hero BTF\\nASUS\\nNick: The ROG Crosshair x870E Hero BTF comes with everything you would expect on a top-shelf motherboard in 2025. It has two PCIEe 5.0 lanes, five M.2 slots for your NVMe SSDs (three PCIe 5.0 and two PCIe 4.0), two 5-gigabit Ethernet ports, Wi-Fi 7, and all of the other bells and whistles you might wish for.\\nThe real standout feature is the special power connector next to the PCIe port. Designed to get unsightly cables out of the way, the revised BTF 2.5 connector (GC-HPWR) can pass up to 1000 watts directly through your motherboard to your GPU, if your GPU supports it. 1000 watts is pretty impressive and more than enough to power any consumer GPU on the market.\\nThese sorts of hidden connectors are increasingly common on motherboards, but ASUS\\'s BTF power delivery system is patented, so you probably won\\'t see it used by other manufacturers any time soon.\\nBest Accessory: Corsair MAKR 75\\nKris: I love building keyboards, but I have to admit, it\\'s not the easiest hobby to get into. If I didn\\'t have someone to help guide me through a lot of the steps on my first board, I don\\'t know if I ever would have gotten through it.\\nKeyboard companies haven\\'t seemed keen on making the process easier for beginners, but Corsair\\'s MAKR 75 Barebones Keyboard Kit appears to be changing that. This DIY kit gives you everything you need to build your own keyboard, but also offers enough flexibility that if you want to tinker with things or upgrade in the future, you\\'re more than free to do so. Not even needing to download an app to customize your macros or change your lighting is just the icing on the cake.\\nYou can purchase the MAKR 75 now on Corsair\\'s site. Prices start at $209, and you can add keycaps, switches, and more for an extra charge.\\nBest Storage Device: Crucial X10 Portable SSD\\nPatrick Campanale / How-To Geek\\nJordan: Crucial announced some new storage devices at Computex 2025, including an external SSD that caught our eye, the X10. We already featured in our favorite SSDs the X10 Pro, an earlier model designed for professionals. The X10 (without the \"Pro\" nomenclature) has broader appeal for us as everyday tech enthusiasts because it comes in more sizes and improves its ruggedness, and we\\'re looking forward to reviewing it in the next few weeks.\\nTopping out at 2,100 MB/s read speeds, the X10 packs a maximum capacity of 8TB. The portable solid-state drive is meant to appeal to not just the creators but also to hobbyists and gamers, so for context, an 8TB drive can hold approximately 114 games. It has a dust and water rating of IP65, meaning it\\'s protected against all dust ingress and against low-pressure water jets. It also has a drop resistance of up to 9.8 feet, beating out the earlier X10 Pro\\'s rating of 7.5 feet.\\nYou can buy the X10 from the Crucial store in 1TB, 2TB, 4TB, 6TB, and 8TB sizes. At the time of writing, Crucial\\'s website says there are no retailers available, but we found the X10 is on Amazon now. The smallest size will run you $140, and that 8 TB whopper will be a painful $780.\\nBest Concept - Software: Elgato Virtual Stream Deck\\nAndrew: At first glance, the Virtual Stream Deck appears to be a simple desktop widget system. But it\\'s actually a competent, super-customizable adaptation of Elgato\\'s Stream Deck hardware—a simple keystroke brings the virtualized interface to the front of your screen where you can quickly access personalized tools, app shortcuts, workflows, and more. Plus, you can have an unlimited number of Virtual Stream Decks on your desktop at any time, or relegate your virtual shortcuts to an external touchscreen display to act as a sort-of faux hardware Deck.\\nMost people will treat the Virtual Stream Deck as an on-screen extension of their hardware Stream Deck. More shortcuts, more fun. That said, I\\'m mostly interested in the portability that this software may provide. If my Photoshop workflow hinges on a hardware Stream Deck, for example, I may no longer need to take that Stream Deck with me when I travel. I can just use the virtualized version.\\nThe Elgato Virtual Stream Deck is available in beta. You can test it today on Mac and PC, but only if you own a hardware Stream Deck, a Corsair Scimitar Elite Wireless SE mouse, or a Corsair Xeneon Edge touch display.\\nBest Concept - Hardware: Zotac Magnus EN75060TC\\nZOTAC\\nPatrick: ZOTAC has made mini computers for quite some time. In fact, mini PCs are far from a new category at all. However, the MAGNUS EN line that ZOTAC announced this year is certainly a game changer. It breaks the mold that mini PCs have come to be known by and actually delivers desktop-level performance in a compact form-factor.\\nThe ZOTAC MAGNUS EN75060TC is a tiny 2.65-liter computer that packs a Core Ultra 7 mobile processor paired with a desktop RTX 5060 Ti. Yes, you read that right, this tiny powerhouse has a desktop-class graphics card in it. That\\'s something we expect to see in larger systems, or even computers with an eGPU, but not from something that\\'s smaller than two bottles of Coke.\\nThe MANGUS EN doesn\\'t stop there, however. It also has two Thunderbolt 4 ports, five USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports, four total display outputs (three DisplayPort and one HDMI), plus two 2.5Gb/s Ethernet jacks. Add to that its Wi-Fi 7 support, and support for both an M.2 NVMe and M.2 SATA drive, this tiny powerhouse of a system could become the new gold standard for desktops, homelab computers, or mini workstations alike.\\nSadly, we don\\'t have any information yet on what the ZOTAC MANGUS EN cost, but if ZOTAC is able to make it affordable at all, I can easily see this thing flying off the shelves for both consumers and professionals.\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

Lineker, below, might be an extreme example, but he sums up every- thing that’s wrong about the corporation.It has a world view at odds with most of the rest of the country, arrogant and complacent presenters who think that anyone who doesn’t agree with them is, frankly, a little bit backward, and a pious, holier-than-thou stance on everything from the Middle East to Brexit. It also has absolutely no idea who its audience is any more. Leave London or the big cities and you are going to find a very, very different society from anything you could imagine in Beebland.I grew up in the States, with its myriad TV channels broadcasting advertising-laden junk; my parents told me in tones of near reverence about the BBC.In the 1980s I visited Czechoslovakia as it then was; I was told by the locals that they had managed to get the truth out to the West about the Communist regime and they had done so with the help of the BBC.When I left university, some of my cleverest counterparts went to work for Auntie, but –and it’s a big but – it was not a well-paid option. Much like becoming a public servant, they did it for the prestige.Well, look at it now.

The BBC is no longer fit for purpose; it needs to be cleared out and rethought down to the basics.One last thought: more than 75% of people prosecuted for not paying the licence fee are women, with all the trauma and domestic upheaval that entails, and you can bet your bottom dollar they’re not on Gary Lineker-sized salaries.

The pundit issued an unreserved apology on Monday after he deleted a post he had previously shared about Zionism that featured a picture of a rat.After this weekend’s Match of the Day, Lineker, 64, will leave his presenting role at the BBC and will no longer front the corporation’s coverage of the 2026 World Cup or the FA Cup next season.A Met Police spokesperson said: “We have received a number of reports from members of the public relating to a post published on social media on Monday, May 12.“The reports will be assessed to determine what further action might be required. There is currently no police investigation into this matter.”It is unclear how any law might have been broken by Lineker who said he was unaware of the rat emoji or its historically offensive symbolism.However, detectives may be considering whether the post amounted to a non-crime hate incident where records are kept for speech that is perceived to demonstrate hostility.In a video on Instagram, in which Lineker referenced the post branded by Downing Street as “completely unacceptable”, he said: “I would like once again to say I’m sorry, unreservedly, for the hurt and upset caused, it was a genuine mistake and oversight, but I should have been more diligent, I know that.”Downing Street said Lineker had made a “significant contribution” to the BBC but it was important the broadcaster upholds the “highest standards”.The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “Specifically in relation to the social media post by Gary Lineker, that was clearly completely unacceptable and it’s right that he’s apologised.“Gary Lineker has obviously made a significant contribution to the BBC’s broadcasting over the last two decades and we obviously wish him the best.”The BBC’s highest-paid presenter has headed up Match of the Day since 1999 and had announced he would be leaving the programme last year at the end of the season, but would still host World Cup and FA Cup coverage.But in the apology video, Lineker said that Sunday will be his last show, adding it was “best for all concerned that I step down from BBC presenting duties altogether and not do next season’s FA Cup or World Cup”.Gary Lineker on day six of the 2023 Wimbledon Championships at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in Wimbledon (Archive/PA)In the wake of his departure, after 26 years at the BBC, the vice president of the Board Of Deputies Of British Jews, Andrew Gilbert, called on the BBC to implement antisemitism training for all its staff.Mr Gilbert said: “We had called for his departure and welcome this outcome. This incident further underscores the importance and urgency of implementing antisemitism training for all BBC staff.”Lineker was temporarily suspended from the BBC in March 2023 after an impartiality row over comments he made criticising the then-government’s new asylum policy.He was also among 500 high-profile figures who signed an open letter in February urging the BBC to rebroadcast a documentary, Gaza: How To Survive A War Zone, to BBC iPlayer.\\n```\\n\\n## [Gary Lineker\\'s football podcast is dropped by BBC Sounds after anti-Semitism row amid fury over how...](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14735403/Gary-Linekers-football-podcast-dropped-BBC-Sounds.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490) (#32615)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 13:06:57+00:00\\n\\n```\\nGary Lineker\\'s football podcast is dropped by BBC Sounds after anti-Semitism row amid fury over how he\\'s still set to appear on MOTD this Sunday despite being axed\\n13:53, 21 May 2025, updated\\n17:40, 21 May 2025\\nBy\\nARTHUR PARASHAR\\nGary Lineker\\'s popular The Rest is Football podcast has been dropped by BBC Sounds\\xa0after the presenter was forced to leave the Corporation amid an antisemitism row.The 64-year-old confirmed his departure from the BBC on Tuesday and \\'apologised unreservedly\\' for sharing a social media post about Zionism with a rat emoji - a derogatory term used by Nazi Germany\\xa0about Jewish people.Mr Lineker will no longer front the BBC\\'s World Cup 2026 coverage in America, Mexico and Canada - while he will bring the curtain down on 26 years of hosting Match of the Day on Sunday, the final day of the Premier League season.The decision to allow him to have a final MOTD swansong - despite being axed over antisemitism - has sparked widespread fury from the Jewish community.Danny Cohen, the BBC\\'s former director of TV, called for Lineker to be denied the chance to say farewell under the circumstances, saying:\\xa0\\'For far too long the BBC has failed to put a stop to Jew-hate and blatant breaches of impartiality on its services.\\'The former England striker has repeatedly apologised, insisting he did not see the rat image and \\'would never consciously repost anything antisemitic\\'.\\xa0He added: \\'However, I recognise the error and upset that I caused, and reiterate how sorry I am. Stepping back now feels like the responsible course of action.\\'But in another bitter blow to Mr Lineker, his Rest is Football podcast will now also be axed from BBC Sounds - as the Corporation looks to fully cut ties with their highest-paid presenter.MailOnline understands the Rest is Football will have its last episode on BBC Sounds this week.\\xa0 Gary Lineker quit the BBC on Tuesday after being caught up in claims of anti-Semitism on social media. He posted a video on Instagram apologising Lineker shared a now-deleted reel on Instagram which originated with pro-Palestine group Palestine Lobby Lineker\\'s The Rest is Football podcast, which he hosts with MOTD colleagues, Alan Shearer, and Micah Richards, is part of his Goalhanger company Mr Lineker\\'s The Rest is Football podcast, which he hosts with MOTD colleagues, Alan Shearer, and Micah Richards, is part of his Goalhanger company.The original Goalhanger contract, announced last November, was for a\\xa0\\'one-year deal with the opportunity to extend, with episodes remaining available on BBC Sounds for three years\\'.The Rest is History, hosted by Tom Holland and Dominic Sandbrook, is the only Goalhanger podcast that will now appear on the BBC streaming service.It comes after it was revealed in March how Lineker\\'s Goalhangers empire had recorded a staggering £1.4million profit last year.Assets jumped over the last 12 months with accounts filed at Companies House showing its retained earnings rose from £590,000 in 2023 to £2.03m last year - a £1.4m rise. Cash in the bank also rose from £560,000 to £2.7m.\\xa0Mr Lineker will present his final Match of the Day on Sunday\\xa0after 26 years and will not front BBC coverage of the 2026 World Cup, or coverage of the FA Cup next season.\\xa0He\\xa0will leave without a payoff from his £1.4million-a-year salary, MailOnline understands.\\xa0Mr Cohen, former controller of BBC Three, BBC One and then Director of BBC Television until 2015, told The Telegraph: \\'The BBC have made the right decision to part ways with Gary Lineker, but he should not be allowed a final swansong this weekend.\\'And why the BBC\\'s statement does not even mention anti-Semitism is hard to understand.\\xa0 Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker smiles outside his home in London after his exit from the BBC was confirmed on Tuesday Lineker trotted from his front door to his car around an hour after his statement was released on Tuesday\\n\\'Given the Nazi echoes of the content shared it will be very hard for many in the Jewish community to see Mr Lineker present Match of the Day again on Sunday.\\xa0\\'If the racist content had been directed at another community I do not believe a presenter would be allowed to carry on for another week\\'.He said: \\'Mr Lineker’s sharing of the post is a symptom of the problem, not the problem itself. The BBC has a serious and wide-ranging problem with anti-Semitism. Only much stronger executive leadership can change that.\\'Announcing his exit in a BBC statement, the former England footballer said: \\'Football has been at the heart of my life for as long as I can remember – both on the pitch and in the studio.\\'I care deeply about the game, and about the work I\\'ve done with the BBC over many years. As I\\'ve said, I would never consciously repost anything antisemitic – it goes against everything I stand for.\\'However, I recognise the error and upset that I caused, and reiterate how sorry I am. Stepping back now feels like the responsible course of action.\\'BBC director general Tim Davie also agreed it is the right decision having reportedly lost patience with the BBC\\'s top-paid presenter. Lineker returned to TV screens for the first time on Saturday to host the FA Cup final after apologising for sharing an \\'anti-Semitic\\' social media post Footballer turned presenter Gary Lineker on Match of the Day in 1999 - his first season in the role he held for 25 campaigns \\'Gary has acknowledged the mistake he made. Accordingly, we have agreed he will step back from further presenting after this season\\', he said.Minutes after the announcement from the BBC, Mr Lineker published his own Instagram video, apologising again and said it was the \\'right time\\' for him and the BBC to go their \\'separate ways\\'.\\xa0\\xa0He said it has been \\'a pleasure and a huge privilege\\' following the announcement that he will leave the BBC after this weekend\\'s Match Of The Day.\\'I would like once again to say I\\'m sorry, unreservedly, for the hurt and upset caused, it was a genuine mistake and oversight, but I should have been more diligent, I know that. I\\'ve stood up for minorities and humanitarian issues and against all forms of racism all of my life, including, of course, antisemitism, which I absolutely abhor. There\\'s no place for it and never should be\\', he said.\\'So I think it\\'s best for all concerned that I step down from BBC presenting duties altogether and not do next season to FA Cup or World Cup, the final day of the Premier League season on Sunday will be my last show. It\\'s been a pleasure and a huge privilege working with the BBC for 30 years, especially hosting Match Of The Day, a programme that is so close to my heart and an integral part of my life.\\'I\\'d like to thank all of the quite brilliant, talented and lovely people, both in front and behind the camera that I\\'ve worked alongside for three decades. You\\'re the absolute best. The relationship with the BBC has been long and wonderful, but it\\'s the right time for the organisation and myself to go our separate ways.\\'Thank you also to all of you (fans) for your incredible support and love over so many years. It means the world to me. I\\'ll see you all on Sunday\\'. Shearer, his co-star on The Rest Is Football, was among those leaving messages alongside the Instagram video.Writing in the comments, former Newcastle and England captain Shearer said: \\'Thank you for everything.\\'\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

It was not clear whether the patient was vaccinated.Fans had traveled from all over the US and internationally to be at the concert, including an appearance from Puerto Rican singer Ozuna.There have been several scares at airports recently after international travelers passed through them infected with measles, including an alert over a potential exposure at Newark Liberty International Airport released last week. The two cases do not appear to be linked.The concert venue is just outside New York City, America\\'s largest metropolis and home to some 8.2million people. There have been five confirmed cases in the state so far this year, although none have led to major outbreaks.Vaccination rates have been dropping across the US in recent years amid inoculation mandates and concerns over side effects from vaccines, raising fears that once eradicated diseases could resurge in the country. Shakira is pictured above at her concert at the MetLife stadium on Thursday. There are fears the concert could have been a major super-spreader event Fans erupted into roars when Shakira emerged onto the stage, and cheered when the singer did cameos with Ozuna A major measles outbreak has been declared in Texas — the largest to hit the nation in at least 20 years — after the disease started to spread in a community with low vaccine uptake.More than 722 people have been sickened in the outbreak to date, while 92 have been hospitalized and two young girls, aged six and eight, have died.Officials fear that the outbreak could continue for more than a year, and that it could cost the US its measles elimination status — achieved in 2000.New Jersey officials said the measles alert covers both of Shakira\\'s shows on May 15, with anyone at the venue between 7.30pm and 1am the next day potentially having been exposed.Further details of the case were not revealed, including where they sat in the stadium, where they had traveled from, or how they had arrived at the venue.No further cases of measles linked to this individual have been reported.The alert comes just a day before Beyonce is due to perform at the venue for her Cowboy Carter Tour, with tens of thousands set to attend. Officials said these individuals should not be at risk of infection related to this alert.\\xa0Measles is the most infectious disease in the world, with infected patients able to pass on the disease to nine out of ten other people they expose who are not vaccinated.It is passed on via droplets expelled in coughs and sneezes, which can hang in the air for up to two hours after a patient passes.Illness begins with flu-like symptoms, before a patient develops a characteristic rash which starts at the hairline and then spreads across the whole body.\\xa0 Fans who attended the concert, shown above, are being warned to monitor themselves for symptoms until June 6. No further details on the case were released, including whether the patient was vaccinated Shakira performed two sets from 7.30pm to 1am on May 15 at the venue The disease is particularly dangerous for young children, with the CDC saying one in 20 unvaccinated children who are infected develop pneumonia while one in 1,000 suffer from encephalitis — or brain swelling that can cause permanent damage.One to three in every 1,000 unvaccinated children who are infected also die from the disease.Officials say the best way to prevent the infection is to get vaccinated, with two doses of the Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) 97 percent effective against the disease.Alerting residents, the New Jersey Department of Health said: \\'[We] are alerting residents about potential exposures associated with a newly identified case of measles in a non-New Jersey resident who attended a concert in New Jersey while infectious.\\'Individuals — especially parents, guardians, health care providers, and caregivers — are urged to be aware of the symptoms of this highly contagious virus.\\'\\xa0\\xa0The New Jersey Transit was on strike at the time of the concert, but some did reach the venue using Coach USA buses that took attendees from the Port Authority to the stadium for the shows.New York City has seen its MMR vaccination rates rise slightly in recent years, while they dropped for the rest of the nation.Data showed that for the school year 2023 to 2024, 96.7 percent of kindergarteners starting school had received two doses of the measles vaccine — up from 96.3 percent the previous year.\\xa0 The Colombian singer is pictured above at the show in MetLife The MetLife — which can hold 82,500 people — was the second venue on the US leg of Shakira\\'s world tour, after she performed in Charlotte, North Carolina, on May 13.Her tour is set to take in another 14 US cities: Detroit, Boston, Washington DC, Atlanta, Orlando, Miami, Arlington, San Antonio, Houston, Inglewood, Phoenix, San Diego, Las Vegas and San Francisco.Shakira\\'s MetLife concert was a major hit, with the singer, 48, delivering non-stop choreography and hits from across the decades.She did a cameo with Ozuna, with whom she has the hit single \\'Monotonia\\'.\\xa0At her second show at the stadium on Friday, she also did cameos with\\xa0Wyclef Jean, with whom she did her most famous song \\'Hips Don\\'t Lie\\', and Puerto Rican singer Rauw Alejandro, with whom she sung the 2022 hit \\'Te Felicito\\'.Fans reportedly faced challenges reaching the venue, with the threat of rain and major travel troubles caused by rail strikes.But the She-Wolves were not deterred, arriving in purple wigs — like Shakira wore in her earlier music — while others donned wolf ears and belly-dancing gear.The star went through more than 13 wardrobe changes during the performance, reports suggest, and sang through multiple hits.It comes after New Jersey health officials released an alert warning of a measles exposure at the main airport on Monday last week.The infected individual traveled through Newark Liberty International Airport\\'s Terminal B, potentially exposing hundreds to the world\\'s most infectious disease. Anyone who was in the airport between 12.30pm and 4pm that day was warned to monitor for symptoms.The two infectious patients that triggered the alert are not thought to be related.\\n```\\n\\n## [Measles Infection Warning Issued After Shakira Concert](https://www.newsweek.com/measles-warning-shakira-concert-2075247) (#33703)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 15:27:47+00:00\\n\\n```\\nHealth officials in New Jersey have issued a measles exposure warning after an individual infected with the virus attended a Shakira concert at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford on May 15, potentially exposing tens of thousands of concertgoers.The New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH) said in a statement that anyone who was at the stadium between 7:30 p.m. on May 15 and 1:00 a.m. on May 16 may have been exposed to measlesWhy It MattersMeasles, which is highly contagious and spreads through the air, can remain infectious in the air or on surfaces for up to two hours.Symptoms typically begin 7 to 14 days after exposure and include high fever, cough, runny nose, and a characteristic rash. The infection can lead to serious health complications, especially in children and immunocompromised individuals.The warning follows a concerning rise in measles cases nationally, with a significant outbreak in Texas that has alarmed public health officials.New Jersey authorities say they are acting out of an abundance of caution, advising potentially exposed individuals to check their vaccination status and monitor for symptoms.What To KnowThe infected person was from out of state, but the NJDOH said in its warning that \"anyone who visited the following location only during the specified dates and times may have been exposed to measles.\"It stressed that anyone who suspects exposure or illness should call a healthcare provider before going to any medical office or emergency department.\"Special arrangements can be made for evaluation while also protecting other patients and medical staff from possible infection,\" it added. \"Please do not visit a medical facility without calling ahead.\"It went on to urge parents, guardians, health care providers and caregivers to \"be aware of the symptoms of this highly contagious virus and to ensure they are up to date with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) shots.\"At the time of the NJDOH\\'s statement, May 20, no associated cases had been reported.\\nShakira performs at MetLife Stadium on Friday, May 16, 2025, in East Rutherford, N.J.\\nAP\\nA total of 1,024 confirmed measles cases have been reported across the country, as of May 15, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).There have been 15 outbreaks reported this so far this year. For comparison, 16 outbreaks were reported in 2024.States affected include Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, New York State, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.What People Are SayingThe NJDOH said: \"The virus spreads easily through the air when someone coughs or sneezes and can remain in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves the area. People can also get sick when they come in contact with mucus or saliva from an infected person.\"Individuals at risk include those who have not been fully vaccinated or have not had measles in the past.\"What Happens NextThe NJDOH has warned that infected people could develop symptoms as late as June 6.Health officials are also coordinating with local healthcare providers and testing sites to facilitate early detection and response.\\n```\\n\\n## [Measles is very contagious. Here\\'s how to avoid it](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/measles-contagious-avoid-122040776) (#35959)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 17:54:31+00:00\\n\\n```\\nNew Jersey health officials are asking people who went to last week\\'s Shakira concert at MetLife Stadium to monitor for measles symptoms because a person went to see the singer while infectious. There is no confirmed outbreak in New Jersey, but the U.S. and North America are seeing high measles activity this year — including hundreds sickened by the highly infectious airborne virus in West Texas — and declining rates of people getting the vaccine, which is 97% effective after two doses. Schools and daycares are among the most common places for measles exposures, like one that happened in three western North Dakota public schools in early May that led to all unvaccinated students being held at home for 21 days under state law. Here’s what to know about the measles and how to protect yourself.Most U.S. children get vaccinated against measles before entering public school, but increasing numbers of people skipping shots for religious or personal reasons have fueled outbreaks in the U.S. and abroad this year.Overall, the U.S. has seen more than 1,000 measles cases across 30 states since the beginning of the year, and 11 states with outbreaks — defined as three or more related cases. The largest outbreak in the U.S. has been in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. There are also large outbreaks in Mexico and Canada. It\\'s a respiratory disease caused by one of the world’s most contagious viruses. The virus is airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It most commonly affects kids.“On average, one infected person may infect about 15 other people,” said Scott Weaver, a center of excellence director for the Global Virus Network, an international coalition. “There’s only a few viruses that even come close to that.”Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash. The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.There’s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.People who have had measles once can’t get it again, health officials say.It usually doesn’t kill people, but it can.Common complications include ear infections and diarrhea. But about 1 in 5 unvaccinated Americans who get measles are hospitalized, the CDC said. Pregnant women who haven’t gotten the vaccine may give birth prematurely or have a low-birthweight baby.Among children with measles, about 1 in every 20 develops pneumonia, the CDC said, and about one in every 1,000 suffers swelling of the brain called encephalitis — which can lead to convulsions, deafness or intellectual disability. “Children develop the most severe illness,\" said Weaver, who works at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. \"The cause of death in these kinds of cases is usually pneumonia and complications from pneumonia.”The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.“Before a vaccine was developed in the 1960s, everybody got” measles, Weaver said. There is “great data” on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, he said, because it\\'s been around for decades. “Any of these outbreaks we’re seeing can easily be prevented by increasing the rate of vaccination in the community,” he said. “If we can maintain 95% of people vaccinated, we’re not going to see this happening in the future. And we’ve slipped well below that level in many parts of the country.”Vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic, and most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners — the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.Not usually. People who are vaccinated are considered protected against measles for their lifetime.Health care providers can test for antibodies and give boosters if needed.Getting another MMR shot as an adult is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don’t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective vaccine made from “killed” virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said.People who have documentation that they had measles are immune, and those born before 1957 generally don’t need the shots because so many children got measles back then that they have “presumptive immunity.”Weaver said people at high risk for infection who got the shots many years ago may want to consider getting a booster if they live in an area with an outbreak. Those may include family members living with someone who has measles or those especially vulnerable to respiratory diseases because of underlying medical conditions.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The 36-year-old US star was arrested by the Metropolitan Police last Thursday after flying into the UK ahead of a series of arena dates on his Breezy Bowl XX world tour. But on Wednesday, Judge Tony Baumgartner agreed that the singer could have bail as long as he complies with a series of conditions. A £5million security has been put up as part of the bail package, he must live at an address in the UK while awaiting trial, and he has also been ordered to surrender his passport to police. However a plan has also been put in place for Brown to travel to Europe, the US, and Canada to complete his Breezy Bowl XX world tour, by using his passport to travel and then leaving it with his lawyers while he completes the gigs. Brown was not in court for Wednesday’s hearing, when he was represented by Sallie Bennett-Jenkins KC. The entrance to Tape London in Mayfair, where Chris Brown is alleged to have assaulted a man (James Manning/PA)PA WireThe singer is accused of an attack on music producer Abraham Diaw at the Tape nightclub in Hanover Square, Mayfair, on February 19, 2023, when he and his entourage were at the venue for a Dirty Martini club night at the time. It is said Mr Diaw was struck several times with a bottle before being pursued across the club and punched and kicked several times. Omolulu Akinlolu, 38, a US national, was charged alongside Brown with grievous bodily harm with intent at the weekend, and has been remanded in custody. Brown was arrested at just after 2am last Thursday at the five-star Lowry Hotel in Manchester. Announcing the criminal charge, Adele Kelly, the Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS London North, said: “We have authorised the Metropolitan Police to charge Chris Brown with one count of grievous bodily harm, contrary to section 18 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861.“The alleged incident occurred in London on 19 February 2023.”She added: “The Crown Prosecution Service reminds all concerned that criminal proceedings against this defendant are active and that he has the right to a fair trial.“It is extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.”Brown was on a worldwide tour and playing in the UK at the time of the alleged attack.The R&B singer was arrested when he flew into Manchester Airport on a private jet ahead of the UK leg of his Breezy Bowl XX world tour, which has scheduled dates around the country including two nights - June 21 and 22 - at London’s Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.The judge agreed to bail conditions that Brown lives at an address in the UK, does not contact Mr Diaw or Akinlolu or go to Tape nightclub, and does not apply for international travel documents.

The decision came just days after Brown was arrested in Manchester, in connection with a violent incident at a London nightclub that left a music producer hospitalised.The 36-year-old singer, who was detained over claims he attacked Abraham Diaw with a glass bottle at Tape nightclub in Mayfair in early 2023, now faces charges of grievous bodily harm with intent. After initially being denied release, Brown has now posted £5 million in bail and agreed to strict conditions that will keep him under the watchful eye of UK authorities while the case moves forward.Serious Charges, Serious AllegationsAccording to court documents, the alleged assault took place in February 2023 during a private party at the exclusive Tape venue. Prosecutors say Brown struck Diaw in the face with a bottle and continued to kick him after he fell to the ground. The charges fall under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, a statute still used in modern-day prosecutions for violent offences.Also implicated is Omololu Akinlolu, a close associate of Brown better known by his stage name Hoody Baby. He too faces charges in relation to the same incident. Both men have denied wrongdoing, but the case is expected to unfold throughout the summer, with further developments anticipated in court next month.Bail Comes with Strings AttachedJudge Tony Baumgartner approved Brown\\'s bail but didn\\'t let him off lightly. The singer was ordered to pay £4 million up front, with the remaining £1 million due within seven days. In addition to the financial conditions, Brown must live at an address approved by the court, surrender his passport when not touring, and avoid any contact with both the alleged victim and his co-defendant.These terms allow Brown to continue his \\'Breezy Bowl XX\\' tour, which marks the 20th anniversary of his debut album. But freedom comes with limits. Brown\\'s legal team will need to ensure he remains fully compliant or risk jeopardising the tour and potentially, his defence.A Global Tour Under a Legal CloudThe tour is due to kick off on 8 June in Amsterdam, with Brown set to return to Manchester, the city where he was arrested just a week later. The schedule includes stops across Europe and North America, with performances running through to October.While Brown has permission to travel for shows, he is expected back in the UK for court appearances. His next hearing is scheduled for 20 June, when he\\'s expected to enter a formal plea. If he contests the charges, the trial could extend into 2026.Industry insiders say tour organisers are pressing ahead, but contingency plans are in place in case court proceedings disrupt any future dates. \\'It\\'s a balancing act,\\' one promoter told reporters. \\'The fans want the shows. But the legal team calls the shots.\\'A Familiar Pattern of TroubleThis isn\\'t the first time Brown has faced serious legal consequences. His 2009 conviction for assaulting then-partner Rihanna remains one of the most high-profile celebrity domestic violence cases in recent memory. He received probation and community service, and although he\\'s publicly apologised and continued to release music, controversy has never been far behind.Since then, Brown has faced a string of lawsuits, restraining orders, and police investigations. While not all have led to charges, they have fuelled a reputation for volatility that he\\'s never fully shaken. The current case involving claims of violence and serious bodily harm may be the most consequential yet.What Comes NextThe spotlight now turns to 20 June, when Brown will return to Southwark Crown Court. If he pleads not guilty, a full trial could follow,forcing a collision between his performance schedule and courtroom demands.So far, Brown has remained silent about the case. But with fans watching, promoters hedging their bets, and the legal system closing in, this summer could become the most pivotal chapter of his career to date.\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

Fortnite hailed its app\\'s long-awaited restoration to the iPhone and iPad in a Tuesday pos t, marking the first time it will be available on those devices since it was ousted in 2020 for trying to avoid the 15% to 30% commissions that Apple collects on in-app transactions.The video game featuring a virtual fight on a digital island is coming back to the iPhone just a few days after its parent company, Epic Games, filed a motion asking a federal judge to order its return as part of a civil contempt of court finding issued against Apple late last month.In a brief statement filed in court late Tuesday, Apple said the dispute that had been keeping Fortnite off its iOS software for the iPhone had been resolved. The Cupertino, California, company didn\\'t immediately respond to a request for further comment.The legal wrangling is all part of a bitter feud that is still boiling. Epic filed a lawsuit alleging Apple had turned its app store into an illegal monopoly — a claim that it lost under a 2021 ruling made by a federal judge after a month-long trial. Although she decided Apple wasn\\'t breaking antitrust laws, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ordered the company to loosen control over in-app payments and allow links to other options that might offer lower prices.After exhausting an appeal that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, Apple last year introduced a new system that opened the door for links to alternative payment options while still imposing a 27% commission on in-app transactions executed outside its own system.Epic fired back by alleging Apple was thumbing its nose at the legal system, reviving another round of court hearings that lasted nearly a year before Gonzalez Rogers delivered her stinging rebuke that included a ban on collecting any kind of commission on alternative payment options. That appeared to clear the way for Fortnite\\'s return to the iPhone and iPad, but Epic last week said the video game was still being blocked by Apple. After Apple contended that keeping Fortnite was still permissible while it pursues an appeal of Gonzalez Rogers\\' contempt ruling, Epic forced the issue by asking the judge for another order that would make clear the video game should be allowed back on the iPhone and iPad.Gonzalez Rogers on Monday asked why Apple was still blocking Fortnite without an order from the appeals court authorizing that action.

But Epic said that Apple was circumventing the ruling.On Monday, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers called on Apple to reinstate Fortnite to the App Store or return to court to prove it had a legal basis for not doing so. The next day, Fortnite was back on iPhones and iPads in the United States, and Epic and Apple signed a joint statement to the court saying they had resolved that particular dispute.Representatives for Epic and Apple did not comment late Tuesday.Their fight began in 2020, when the game maker started encouraging users of the Fortnite iOS app to pay it directly, rather than through the App Store. It also gave Android users instructions for getting around Google’s payment system.Hours later, Apple and Google banned Fortnight from their official app stores. Epic then swiftly sued the two tech giants in federal court over their requirements that it use their payment systems.Apple countersued, and the judge ordered Epic to pay Apple $3.6 million for breaching its contract with the company. A federal appeals court also found in 2023 that Apple did not have a monopoly in mobile games, as Epic had argued.But the court said that Apple had violated California’s Unfair Competition Law, and it ordered the company to allow apps with links and buttons for purchasing software and services outside the App Store.Apple and Epic appealed, for different reasons, but the Supreme Court declined last year to review the case.Fortnite was also kicked off the App Store for users in the European Union in 2020. But last year, under pressure from European regulators, Apple allowed Epic to install Fortnight on iOS devices there through Epic’s own store.The two companies are still fighting in court over Apple’s App Store policies.After the 2023 ruling, Apple changed its policies to allow developers to link to alternative payment options. But it created screens to discourage online purchases by making them appear dangerous and continued charging a commission for online purchases, court documents show.Epic then argued in court that Apple wasn’t complying with the order, and a judge ruled in Epic’s favor in April, holding Apple in civil contempt. Apple appealed that ruling and requested a delay of the court’s order to loosen its grip on the App Store.In Epic’s case with Google, a jury ruled in 2023 that Google had maintained a monopoly in the smartphone app store market. Google has appealed, and its app store, Google Play, still does not carry Fortnite. But the game can be downloaded onto Android phones directly from Epic’s games store. Google did not respond to a request for comment late Tuesday.John Yoon is a Times reporter based in Seoul who covers breaking and trending news.A version of this article appears in print on \\xa0, Section B, Page 6 of the New York edition with the headline: Fortnite Back in Apple App Store After Legal Win Ends 5-Year Ban.

That will be your legacy. … My kids are gonna be breathing that air, just like yours,\" he said.\"If your children were drinking the water in Santa Ana, Mr. Zeldin… maybe you would give a damn,\" he said after holding up a glass of water and claiming the EPA’s move toward streamlining its grants and expenditures will lead to a panoply of bad outcomes.KASH PATEL ENRAGES SCHIFF IN CLINTONIAN BATTLE OVER THE WORD ‘WE’ AND A JANUARY 6 SONG\"You need the money for a tax cut for rich people because you’re totally beholden to the oil industry,\" Schiff fumed, accusing Zeldin of unlawful termination of congressionally appropriated grants.\"You could give a rat’s a-- about how much cancer your agency causes,\" Schiff said, raising his voice as Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., banged the gavel to note his time was up.Earlier in the hearing, Zeldin clashed with Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., over grant reviews and claimed the administrator couldn’t \"get [his] story straight.\"Whitehouse appeared to make the claim that the EPA was not individually reviewing each of the grants it was canceling and cited court testimony from Zeldin official Travis Voyles that he had conducted an \"individualized review\" as of February.FLASHBACK: SCHIFF, WHO REPEATEDLY CLAIMED EVIDENCE OF RUSSIAN COLLUSION, DENOUNCES DURHAM REPORT AS ‘FLAWED’ From left: Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin; Sen.

Then EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin delivered the perfect line\\xa0to describe Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA), when Schiff attacked him for trying to cut waste and abuse.

Zeldin, a former Republican congressman, has said his tenure will turbocharge the American economy while ensuring clean air and water. Democrats say he is endangering the lives of millions of Americans and abandoning the agency’s dual mission to protect the environment and human health.Zeldin, who took office in January, has proposed a flood of changes that would sharply reduce the agency\\'s workforce, terminate billions of dollars in grants approved by the Biden administration and roll back dozens of environmental rules including landmark regulations on climate change and pollution from coal-fired power plants.Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., told Zeldin that a plan to cut EPA spending by 55% means that, to Zeldin and Trump, “more than half of the environmental efforts of the EPA ... to make sure Americans have clean air and clean water are just a waste.” If approved by Congress, the budget cuts “will mean there’s more diesel and more other particulate matter in the air\" and that “water that Americans drink is going to have more chemicals,” Schiff said.“Your legacy will be more lung cancer,\" he told Zeldin. \"It’ll be more bladder cancer. It’ll be more leukemia and pancreatic cancer ... more rare cancers of innumerable varieties.\\'\\' Replied Zeldin: “I understand that you are an aspiring fiction writer. I see why.”Schiff said the real fiction was Zeldin\\'s apparent belief that he can cut the EPA\\'s budget in half “and it won\\'t affect people\\'s health, or their water or their air.\" Schiff said the Republican administrator was “totally beholden to the oil industry,” adding: \"You could give a rat\\'s ass about how much cancer your agency causes.\"Zeldin engaged in a similar rhetorical match with Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.Whitehouse said Zeldin and others at EPA have made “baseless accusations of fraud” about grants awarded under Democratic President Joe Biden, removed “career officials who stood up for the rule of law” and deployed FBI agents \"to harass career civil servants.\\'\\'Whitehouse also challenged Zeldin\\'s contention that he had personally reviewed 781 Biden-era grants totaling nearly $2 billion that the Trump administration later canceled. The grants were intended to address chronic pollution in minority communities and jump-start clean energy programs across the country, but Zeldin said they were plagued by conflicts of interest and unqualified recipients.“You don\\'t care about wasting money, but the Trump administration does, Senator,\" Zeldin said.When Whitehouse pressed to see Zeldin\\'s schedule to prove he personally reviewed the grants before canceling them, Zeldin said he\\'s worked on the issue “almost every single day” since taking office.\"We are cracking down on every waste, every aspect of abuse,\\'\\' Zeldin said, adding that Whitehouse seemed unable to grasp that more than one person could review EPA\\'s grant program.\"I am insisting on the facts,\\'\\' Whitehouse said.American taxpayers “put President Trump in office because of people like you,” Zeldin replied. “They have Republicans in charge of the House and Senate because of people like you. You don\\'t want me to go through the list of all the evidence of waste and abuse.\"Whitehouse replied that Zeldin should explain why Justice Department lawyers, speaking under oath on behalf of the agency, have “said that everything you just said is not true. That\\'s what I want.”A lawyer for the EPA told a federal appeals court this week that the agency was “not accusing anybody of fraud” in a separate dispute over its termination of $20 billion in grants under a so-called green bank program to finance clean energy and climate-friendly projects nationwide.\\n```\\n\\n## [\\'Maybe you would give a damn\\': Democrat skewers EPA administrator](https://www.dailykos.com/story/2025/5/21/2323618/--Maybe-you-would-give-a-damn-Democrat-skewers-EPA-administrator?pm_campaign=blog&pm_medium=rss&pm_source=) (#40945)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 21:00:04+00:00\\n\\n```\\n© Kos Media, LLC.\\nSite content may be used for any purpose without explicit permission unless otherwise specified. \\'Kos\\' and \\'Daily Kos\\' are registered trademarks of Kos Media, LLC.\\nPrivacy Policy\\nDaily Kos\\nFront Page\\nComics\\nRSS\\nSubscribe\\nGift Subscriptions\\nSign Up / Manage Newsletters\\nAbout\\nTerms\\nRules of the Road\\nDMCA Copyright Notice\\nPrivacy\\nAbout Us\\nMasthead\\nCode of Ethics\\nContact Us\\nAdvertising\\nAdvertising Overview\\nCareers\\nJobs\\nMerchandise\\nShirts\\nConnect With Us\\nDaily Kos moves in solidarity with the Black community.\\nLearn More\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

This March and April have both also been record-breaking months for sunshine, the Met Office say.However, weather patterns can be unpredictable and Professor Hawkins said the driest season ever - spring 1852 - was followed by the wettest two month period on record in November and December that year.\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

Tammy Duckworth of Illinois flagged the cost of converting the jet during the hearing, saying it could cost up to $1 billion to ensure it was capable of operating as part of the Air Force One fleet.\"Far from saving money, this unconstitutional action will not only cost our nation its dignity, but it will force taxpayers to waste over a billion dollars to overhaul this particular aircraft, when we currently have not one, but two, fully operational and fully capable Air Force One aircraft,\" Duckworth said.Duckworth also expressed concerns that corners could be cut to get the plane into service before Trump\\'s second term comes to an end.\\nEarlier this month, Trump announced that Qatar had gifted him the jet to serve as Air Force One. It\\'s the most expensive gift to a US president in history.\"It\\'s a great gesture from Qatar,\" Trump told reporters. \"I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer. I mean, I could be a stupid person and say, \\'No, we don\\'t want a free, very expensive airplane.\\'\"But accepting the gift has prompted a bipartisan backlash, with Democrats and some Republicans saying it violates long-standing rules about presidents accepting expensive gifts from foreign leaders.In a press briefing on Monday, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, rebutted suggestions the plane was a gift to Trump, saying it had been donated to the US Air Force by the Qatari royal family and was being \"retrofitted to the highest standards\" to serve as an Air Force One plane.She didn\\'t give details on how long the process would take.Aviation experts told NBC News last week that converting the plane to serve as Air Force One would involve installing top-secret systems at an estimated cost of about $1 billion.There are two planes operating as part of the Air Force One fleet, with Trump scrapping a contract for a new plane in his first term, before renegotiating it.Boeing is contracted to convert two 747 jets to serve as part of the fleet, but the project has encountered delays, and the first plane isn\\'t expected to be ready until 2027.\\nTrump\\nRead next\\n```\\n\\n## [Donald Trump\\'s administration officially accepts $400m plane as gift from Qatar](https://news.sky.com/story/donald-trumps-administration-officially-accepts-400m-plane-as-gift-from-qatar-13372304) (#35838)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 18:03:00+00:00\\n\\n```\\nThe Trump administration has officially accepted a luxury jet that will be used as Air Force One as a gift from Qatar, the Pentagon said.

That would be ideal.\"Boeing has been working to finish new Air Force One jets for years, and the president has previously complained about the delays. But the Trump administration has presented no national security imperative for a swift upgrade, rather than waiting for those to be ready.\\n```\\n\\n## [US defence officials confirm acceptance of Qatari plane for Air Force One](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq855lx87z3o) (#36022)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 18:49:16+00:00\\n\\n```\\nThe US has accepted a plane intended for the Air Force One fleet from Qatar, a gift that has sparked criticism including from some of President Trump\\'s biggest supporters.\"The secretary of defense has accepted a Boeing 747 from Qatar in accordance with all federal rules and regulations,\" Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement on Wednesday. The plane will need to be modified before it can be used as part of Air Force One - the president\\'s official mode of air transport.The White House insists that the gift is legal, but the announcement of the transfer a week ago caused huge controversy.The plane is a gift from the Qatari royal family and is estimated to be worth $400m (£300m). The White House says that the new plane will be transferred to Trump\\'s presidential library at the end of his term.It could require years to fit with additional security systems and upgrades required to carry the president - including the ability to withstand the electromagnetic pulse from a nuclear blast, and to refuel mid-flight.Mark Cancian, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies\\' Defense and Security Department, says the costs of such retrofitting could easily run to $1bn (£750m).Justifying the transfer a week ago Trump said: \"They\\'re giving us a gift\". The president has also said it would be \"stupid\" to turn down the plane.The US Constitution has a provision known as the Emoluments Clause, which prohibits gifts to public officials from foreign governments without permission of Congress. The transfer has not received congressional approval.The president has argued that the plane transfer is legal because it is being given to the US defence department, and not to him personally. He also insisted he would not use it after leaving office.The current Air Force One fleet includes two 747-200 jets which have been in use since 1990, along with several smaller 757s.Trump has expressed his displeasure at the aircraft manufacturer Boeing, which has been contracted to provide the White House with two 747-8s directly.His team negotiated to receive them during his first term in office, though there have been repeated delays and Boeing has cautioned that they will not be available for two or three more years.Trump surreptitiously visited the Qatari plane in Palm Beach, near his Mar-a-Lago resort, just a few weeks after the start of his second term in office.The president insists there is no quid-pro-quo involved and that the plane is a simple exchange between two allies.On Truth Social he wrote: \"The Defense Department is getting a gift, free of charge, of a 747 aircraft to replace the 40-year-old Air Force One, temporarily, in a very public and transparent transaction.\"Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani has said the transfer \"is a government-to-government transaction. \"It has nothing to do with personal relationships - neither on the US side, nor the Qatari side. It\\'s between the two defence ministries,\" he said.But those assertions have done little to calm the criticism of the deal, including from a number of Trump\\'s allies in Congress and the right-wing media. \"I think it\\'s not worth the appearance of impropriety, whether it\\'s improper or not,\" Rand Paul, Republican senator from Kentucky, told Fox News.\"I wonder if our ability to judge [Qatar\\'s] human rights record will be clouded by the fact of this large gift,\" Paul said.Another Republican senator, Ted Cruz of Texas, said accepting the gift would pose \"significant espionage and surveillance problems\".\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

It may even end up being a permanent fixture in its port as it won’t get in the way and might just be more convenient to just leave it plugged in all the time.\\nBut it’s not just small. It’s fast. With read speeds up to 400 MB/s, it can stream 4K video files without issue and transfer large data files within seconds, not minutes. It’s the perfect high-speed USB flash drive for laptops, smart TVs, gaming consoles, and even car audio systems. And it’s pretty robust, too. The Samsung Fit Plus is waterproof, shockproof, magnet-proof, X-ray-proof, and secure even if you accidentally drop it.\\nWith price drops on all the capacities from 128GB to 512GB, you can snag whichever one best fits your data needs.

Or just about anything that you could possibly need storage for. Whether you’re taking a bunch of pictures or you need some space for Switch games, a microSD card is a great option that can give you more space to store everything. But if you’re going to use one, you should get a larger one, the largest one you can find so you don’t have to keep buying more. If you’re thinking about doing just that, Amazon has your back.\\nHead to Amazon right now to get the Samsung Evo Select MicroSD Memory Card + Adapter for just $30, down from its usual price of $56. That’s $26 off and a discount of 46%.\\nSee at Amazon\\nAffordable storage in a tiny form factor\\nWith 512GB of storage, that gives you tons of space for just about anything you might want to store. Yes, that includes videos, pictures, and other types of files, even if it’s just stuff you’re making and/or using for work. It’s also incredibly small in terms of form factor, so you can take it with you everywhere you go without it having to be a thing. No one wants to lug around a big hard drive, either.\\nThe card comes with an SD adapter too, so you can use it with plenty of other things like DSLR cameras, laptops, action cams, and more. If you’re switching between phones and traditional cameras, this is a simple way to move files or use one card across multiple devices without a hitch. And you never know when you might need to.\\nDurability is another big plus. The EVO Select is built to handle water, extreme temperatures, X-rays, and magnets, so it’s not going to fail you in the middle of a trip or important shoot. Whether you’re shooting video on a hike or storing sensitive files while traveling, it’s good to know your data is protected, and accessible if you need it for something quickly – like data from a dash cam.\\nFor just $30 (-46%), this is a microSD card deal you’re not going to want to pass off. Consider the fact that it’s over half off and that might cement your buying decision right there. But if not, think about all the times you were too annoyed to have to delete files.

In fact, the company’s C755 mini-LED TV is currently listed as the top budget option in our round up of the best TVs in Australia.So, while we’ve not yet reviewed it, I’m confident to recommend the TCL C7K – which is part of the company’s 2025 range announced in March – as a terrific budget TV buy, especially at just AU$1,610 for the 65-inch model, with the potential of a price beat option of AU$1,595 at The Good Guys. I can’t say for sure, but I can’t see it coming down any further in price during the upcoming EOFY sales.Why am I so confident that the C7K is a good telly? TechRadar’s managing editor of home entertainment, Matt Bolton, has seen the C7K with his own eyes and has already deemed it to be “the affordable TV to beat in 2025”. He highlighted the mini-LED panel’s ability to deliver deep blacks, even in a brightly lit room, alongside punchy colours made possible by its high brightness.High praise indeed. Plus, his claim applies to its regular price, which TCL’s Australian website tells me is AU$2,295 for the 65-inch variant and not the AU$1,895 mentioned on The Good Guys’ website.If 65 inches is too big, or too small, other sizes are available between 50 and 98 inches, with prices currently maxing out at AU$5,520 (or AU$5,505, again with The Good Guys’ Price Beat feature). Interestingly, Appliances Online has seriously undercut The Good Guys for the 85-inch model at a staggeringly low AU$2,526.For some extra reading, we’ve also published a glowing TCL QM7K review in the US, which Matt says is the “closest US model to the C7K” and which our tester said was an “impressive TV” that delivers a “great-looking picture”. While we can’t yet say categorically they’re the same TV, they’re awfully close on paper and we’d expect a similar performance from the model we have here in Australia.Regardless, given TCL’s impressive track record in our testing rooms, I have no doubt that the C7K will be an impressive living-room upgrade. Plus, for under AU$1,600 if you can get The Good Guys to keep the price-beat promise, it’s an absolute steal.You might also likeView more of the best 65-inch TVs in AustraliaHow far mini-LED TV tech has evolved in 9 years and the \\'dark side\\' of Netflix – what I learned on my visit with TCLTCL and Samsung reveal big updates to two OLED-beating technologies, but don\\'t get excited for them in TVs yet\\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\\nMax is a senior staff writer for TechRadar who covers home entertainment and audio first, NBN second and virtually anything else that falls under the consumer electronics umbrella third.

The technology has been around long enough at this point that you really don’t need to burn a hole through your wallet to afford a pair. Look at Sony. Right now, Sony’s WH-CH720N noise-canceling headphones which normally go for $150 have been cut in price for a limited time. The pink and white options have been brought down by 35% each, landing on the new price of $98. The black, however, have been discounted even further at 35% off which brings it down to just $88. That’s a savings of $62.\\nI’ve got to hand it to Sony. The company’s name choice when it comes to its flagship set of headphones never seizes to amaze me. If we check out Apple’s over-the-ear headphones, we’ll see they appropriately been dubbed the AirPods Max. Samsung’s earbuds are eloquently named Galaxy Buds, fitting into line all the other Samsung Galaxy personal devices.\\nSee at Amazon\\nBut then we have Sony. Oh, Sony. Here we have the WH-CH720N noise-canceling headphones. One might think some product manage at Sony was having a hectic day and mistakenly filled out the field on some form with not the product name but with its SKU number. Honestly though?

This is exactly what happened on Thursday evening, he saw firefighters needing assistance and helped without hesitation,” they said.“He was not a victim but a hero, he died the way he lived – helping others and putting them ahead of himself.“Although he is no longer with us, he will always be in our hearts and his legacy will continue.”\\n```\\n\\n## [Bicester Motion Fire: Update on two hospitalised firefighters](https://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/25179487.bicester-motion-fire-update-two-hospitalised-firefighters/?ref=rss) (#32489)\\n\\n> 2025-05-21 07:46:57+00:00\\n\\n```\\nOxfordshire Fire Service has confirmed the two firefighters hospitalised after last week\\'s fire at Bicester Motion are concious and in a stable condition.\\nA fire at Bicester Motion on Buckingham Road, Bicester, broke out on Thursday evening prompting a major emergency response.\\nThree people were killed in the fire with two firefighters, 30-year-old Jennie Logan and 38-year-old Martyn Sadler, among the victims.\\nThe tragedy also claimed the life of 57-year-old father-of-two, David Chester, who worked at the site.\\nREAD MORE:\\xa0Decision due on 37 homes for Oxfordshire town near Cotswolds\\nTwo firefighters were also hospitalised in the blaze.\\nThis morning, Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service confirmed they were concious and in a stable condition.\\nAn update on its website said: “They are conscious and remain in a stable condition in hospital.

      "{'id': 65, 'title': 'Pakistan Attacks, Australia Rate Cut, US Weather & Politics, UK Arson, Trump Bill, Global Scrutiny, Nintendo Switch 2', 'content': '## Main Stories\\n\\n<u>**Pakistan: Children Killed in Dual Attacks, Highlighting Persistent Insecurity**</u>\\nTwo separate, brutal attacks in **Pakistan** have underscored the nation\\'s ongoing struggle with militant violence, both resulting in the deaths of children. In northwest **Pakistan**, near the Afghan border, a suspected drone strike in **Mir Ali** on **May 19th** killed four children and wounded five others. This incident, for which no group has yet claimed responsibility, triggered protests by thousands of residents demanding justice and accountability. Suspicion, given the area\\'s history as a base for the **Pakistani Taliban (TTP)** and the group\\'s recent uptick in attacks, naturally falls in that direction.\\n\\nDays later, on **May 21st**, a suicide car bombing in **Khuzdar**, southwestern **Pakistan**, targeted a school bus, killing another four children and wounding 38. This attack bears the hallmarks of **Baloch separatist groups**, notably the **Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA)**, which has a long history of insurgency in the resource-rich province. The **Pakistan Government** has condemned both attacks and promised investigations.\\n\\nThese incidents are more than tragic headlines; they are stark indicators of the persistent and multifaceted security challenges confronting **Islamabad**. The government\\'s ability to control its territory and protect its citizens, particularly the most vulnerable, remains in question. The drone strike, if confirmed, raises further questions about sovereignty and the methods used in counter-terrorism. The school bus bombing demonstrates the separatists\\' continued capability and willingness to inflict civilian casualties. Both events risk inflaming local grievances and potentially escalating regional tensions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**Australia: RBA Cuts Rate Amid Global Jitters, Domestic Tax Squabble Simmers**</u>\\nThe **Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)** has trimmed its cash rate by 25 basis points to **3.85%**, a move aimed at easing pressure on mortgage holders while navigating choppy global economic waters. **RBA Governor Michele Bullock** acknowledged that global economic uncertainty, significantly influenced by former **US President Trump\\'s** tariff rhetoric, played a role in the decision. The bank reportedly considered a more aggressive 50 basis point cut but opted for caution.\\n\\n**Governor Bullock** noted that while inflation is trending down and the jobs market remains robust, the RBA is alert to recessionary risks if conditions worsen. She also pointedly stated that monetary policy alone cannot solve Australia\\'s housing shortage, urging other policy levers to be pulled. **Treasurer Jim Chalmers** welcomed the rate cut as \"relief for millions\" but echoed concerns about global unpredictability.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the **Albanese** Labor government\\'s proposal to tax superannuation balances above **$3 million** continues to stir debate. Critics, such as Liberal MP **Tim Wilson**, argue the tax could disproportionately affect younger Australians by retirement and that exemptions for certain defined benefit schemes—including those covering some politicians and judges—are hypocritical. **Chalmers** insists the tax will eventually apply to defined benefit schemes, but \"design flaws\" are reportedly causing delays and exemptions, muddying the waters. The RBA\\'s move and the superannuation tax fight highlight the delicate balancing act of managing domestic economic pressures against a backdrop of international instability and contentious local policy.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**US: Southern Plains Reeling from Severe Weather as Biden Cancer Diagnosis Fuels Political Firestorm**</u>\\nThe **Southern Plains** and **Southeastern US** are grappling with the aftermath of severe weather, including devastating tornadoes and flash floods, which have caused fatalities, widespread damage, and power outages. **Kentucky** was particularly hard-hit by a tornado around **May 16-17**, prompting calls for federal assistance. **Senator Josh Hawley** is demanding **FEMA** funding for **Missouri** following tornadoes there, reflecting broader concerns about the agency\\'s disaster response.\\n\\nSimultaneously, the announcement that former **President Joe Biden** has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones has ignited a political firestorm. **President Donald Trump** questioned the timing of the diagnosis, suggesting a potential cover-up during **Biden\\'s** presidency. This narrative has been amplified by some conservative media and even reportedly by former **Biden** aides. A **Biden** spokesperson countered that his last PSA screening was in **2014** and he was not diagnosed until last week.\\n\\nThe confluence of a natural disaster and a high-profile health crisis involving a former president creates a volatile mix. The severe weather demands an effective emergency response, yet **FEMA** faces ongoing scrutiny. **Biden\\'s** diagnosis, beyond the personal tragedy, has immediately become fodder for political speculation, raising questions about medical transparency for public figures and the ethics of politicizing health. The situation also brings into focus the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot initiative and the broader challenges of cancer research, particularly for older patients. The timing, regardless of intent, is undeniably awkward and will continue to be exploited.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**UK: Arson Attacks Near Starmer Properties as Brexit Deal and Economic Policies Ignite Fury**</u>\\nSecurity concerns around **UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer** have escalated following arson attacks targeting properties linked to him. Two men, **Stanislav Carpiuc** (a Romanian national born in Ukraine) and **Roman Lavrynovych** (a Ukrainian national), have been charged with conspiracy to commit arson and arson, respectively. The incidents involved a car previously owned by **Starmer** being set alight on **May 8th**, a fire at a property where he once lived on **May 11th**, and a small fire at his private home\\'s doorway on **May 12th**. Counter-terrorism police are leading the investigation.\\n\\nThese attacks occur against a backdrop of intense political debate. **Starmer\\'s** recently renegotiated **Brexit deal** with the **EU**, which includes provisions on fishing rights and a potential youth mobility scheme, is under fire. Critics, including Conservative figure **Kemi Badenoch**, label it a \"total sell-out\" that compromises UK sovereignty. Simultaneously, **Chancellor Rachel Reeves** faces backlash for cuts to the winter fuel allowance and maintaining the two-child benefit cap, policies defended as necessary for economic stability but criticized for hitting vulnerable households.\\n\\nThe arson attacks, whatever their specific motive (which remains unclear), inject a dangerous element into an already heated political environment. The debates over **Brexit\\'s** final form and the government\\'s economic choices are fueling significant discontent, which parties like **Nigel Farage\\'s Reform UK** are capitalizing on, gaining traction by focusing on immigration and economic grievances. The government is thus fighting battles on multiple fronts: ensuring the Prime Minister\\'s security, selling a contentious **Brexit** deal, and managing economic pain that shows little sign of abating.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**US: Trump\\'s \"Big, Beautiful Bill\" Hits Republican Headwinds in the House**</u>\\n**President Trump** is exerting considerable pressure on House Republicans to pass his signature \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act,\" a sweeping legislative package encompassing tax cuts, spending reductions, and stringent immigration policies. However, the bill is encountering significant internal resistance within the **GOP**, primarily over proposed changes to State and Local Tax (**SALT**) deductions and cuts to **Medicaid**.\\n\\nThe bill, estimated to cost trillions over the next decade, narrowly cleared the House Budget Committee after an initial failure, requiring a re-vote strategy. Concerns about its fiscal impact are mounting; **Moody\\'s Ratings** recently downgraded the nation\\'s debt, citing the bill\\'s potential to balloon the deficit. The White House, through spokeswoman **Karoline Leavitt**, insists the bill will save **$1.6 trillion**, a claim disputed by the **Joint Committee on Taxation\\'s** estimate of a **$3.8 trillion** cost. **Trump** himself has dismissed concerns about **Medicaid** cuts, claiming they target \"waste, fraud and abuse,\" and opposes increasing **SALT** deductions to avoid benefiting \"Democrat governors.\" A controversial proposal within the bill is a tax on remittances sent by foreigners residing in the U.S., championed by figures like **Rep. Kevin Hern** as a way to fund border security and hit cartel finances.\\n\\n**Trump\\'s** personal visit to Capitol Hill on **May 20th** to rally support underscores the bill\\'s importance to his second-term agenda. Yet, **House Speaker Mike Johnson** faces a formidable task in unifying his narrow majority, with members like **Rep. Mike Lawler** of New York opposing the bill over insufficient **SALT** cap relief. This legislative battle highlights the deep fissures within the Republican party on fiscal policy and the practical challenges of enacting **Trump\\'s** ambitious, and costly, promises. The outcome will be a key indicator of **Trump\\'s** legislative clout and the **GOP\\'s** direction.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**Global Stage: Israel and Russia Face Intensifying International Scrutiny**</u>\\nInternational pressure is ratcheting up on both **Israel** over its conduct in **Gaza** and **Russia** concerning the war in **Ukraine**. The **UK**, **France**, and **Canada** have jointly threatened \"concrete actions\" against **Israel** due to its military operations and severe restrictions on humanitarian aid into **Gaza**. The **UK** has taken the step of summoning the Israeli ambassador and suspending trade talks, with **Prime Minister Keir Starmer** calling the suffering of children in **Gaza** \"utterly intolerable.\" **French President Emmanuel Macron** has suggested moving towards recognizing a Palestinian state and halting arms deliveries for use in **Gaza**. **Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu** dismissed the criticism as a \"huge prize\" for **Hamas**.\\n\\nMeanwhile, efforts to broker a ceasefire in the **Russia-Ukraine** war are fraught with uncertainty. Former **US President Donald Trump** reportedly spoke with **Russian President Vladimir Putin** for two hours on **May 19th**, claiming **Putin** wants peace and that negotiations would start \"immediately.\" **Putin** stated **Russia** is ready to work on a memorandum for a possible peace agreement, including a temporary ceasefire. However, **Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky** expressed skepticism, believing **Russia** is trying to buy time and insisting **Trump** should not make decisions about **Ukraine** \"without us.\" Adding to the pressure on **Moscow**, the **EU** and **UK** announced new rounds of sanctions against **Russia**.\\n\\nThe diplomatic maneuvering around both conflicts is intense. Western allies are showing uncharacteristic unity and firmness regarding **Israel\\'s** actions in **Gaza**, signaling that patience with the humanitarian crisis is wearing thin. In the **Ukraine** conflict, **Trump\\'s** intervention adds another layer of complexity, with its potential impact on transatlantic unity and **Kyiv\\'s** negotiating position remaining highly ambiguous. Heavy fighting continues, and a genuine path to peace appears distant despite the flurry of diplomatic activity.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**Gaming: Nintendo Ramps Up Switch 2 Production with Samsung, Confirms Gamescom Appearance**</u>\\n**Nintendo** is making significant moves to ensure a strong launch for its upcoming **Switch 2** console, partnering with **Samsung Electronics** to increase chip production. The goal is to ship over **20 million units** by **March 2026**, with the console slated for a global launch on **June 5, 2025**. Reports indicate high pre-order demand for the successor to the popular hybrid console. The chipset itself is designed by **Nvidia**.\\n\\nIn a further sign of its commitment to a major rollout, **Nintendo** has confirmed its attendance at **Gamescom 2025**, the major gaming event in **Cologne, Germany**, scheduled for **August 20-24**. This will likely be a key platform for showcasing **Switch 2** games and building consumer excitement. **Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa** has set ambitious sales targets, aiming to match the success of the original **Switch**, banking on features like backward compatibility and software bundles.\\n\\nThe partnership with **Samsung** is a strategic move to secure vital components and scale production effectively. While details on the **Switch 2\\'s** full specifications and launch lineup remain somewhat under wraps, including ongoing speculation about an LCD versus a future OLED screen, **Nintendo\\'s** actions signal a confident and aggressive approach to capturing the next generation of gamers.\\n\\n## United Kingdom focus\\n\\n<u>**UK: Lucy Connolly\\'s Appeal Against Racial Hatred Sentence Dismissed**</u>\\n**Lucy Connolly**, wife of a former Conservative councillor, has lost her appeal against a 31-month prison sentence for inciting racial hatred. The **Court of Appeal** found no arguable basis that the original sentence, handed down in **October 2024**, was manifestly excessive. **Lord Justice Holroyd** delivered the judgment, upholding the initial ruling.\\n\\n**Connolly** was convicted after posting an inflammatory message on **X** (formerly Twitter) in **July 2024** following the **Southport murders**, where three young girls were killed. Her post, viewed approximately 310,000 times before deletion, called for mass deportation and the burning of hotels housing asylum seekers. This occurred amidst a volatile atmosphere fueled by false online claims that the **Southport** perpetrator was a Muslim asylum seeker, which led to riots in several locations. **Connolly** pleaded guilty to the charge under the **Public Order Act 1986**.\\n\\nThe case has ignited debate around free speech, the severity of sentences for online incitement, and alleged political motivations. **Connolly\\'s** husband, **Raymond Connolly**, maintains his wife is not racist and that the sentence is \"shocking and unfair,\" suggesting she is being made an example of. Figures like **Toby Young** of the **Free Speech Union** have criticized the sentence as disproportionately harsh compared to those for other serious crimes. The court, however, has clearly signaled a low tolerance for online rhetoric deemed to incite racial hatred, particularly in a charged social climate.\\n\\n## Superpower monitor\\n\\n<u>**US Politics: Elon Musk Signals Retreat from Big-Ticket Political Spending After Wisconsin Flop**</u>\\n**Elon Musk**, the billionaire entrepreneur who poured over **$290 million** into the **2024 US election cycle**, primarily backing **Donald Trump**, has announced a significant reduction in his future political spending. This apparent shift follows a costly and unsuccessful investment in the **Wisconsin Supreme Court** race in **April 2025**, where his preferred conservative candidate, **Brad Schimel**, was defeated. That foray reportedly damaged **Musk\\'s** public image and potentially his business interests.\\n\\nSpeaking at the **Qatar Economic Forum** on **May 20th**, **Musk** stated he plans to spend \"a lot less\" on elections, though he left the door open for future engagement if he \"sees a reason to.\" This marks a change from early **2025**, when **Musk** was a prominent figure in **Washington**, even leading the **Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)** within the **Trump** administration—an initiative criticized for not achieving its lofty goals. Despite this pullback, **Musk** reportedly maintains a relationship with **Trump**, having recently accompanied him on part of a Middle East trip.\\n\\nDemocrats, like **Wisconsin Democratic Party Chairman Ben Wikler**, are claiming victory, suggesting public pressure made **Musk** and his money \"toxic.\" Others, like **Democratic U.S. Representative Mark Pocan**, remain skeptical of a genuine retreat. **Musk\\'s** move can be interpreted as a pragmatic recalibration after a political gamble failed to pay off, perhaps a recognition that overt, high-stakes political intervention carries significant reputational and financial risks for a public-facing CEO. Whether this is a permanent strategic shift or a temporary tactical withdrawal remains to be seen.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**Global Trade: US Navigates Shifting Alliances and Tensions with China, Mexico, and Post-Brexit UK**</u>\\nThe global trade landscape is in flux, shaped by ongoing **US** policy adjustments, the lingering effects of **Brexit**, and the complex **US-China** relationship. In Europe, a new **UK-EU deal**, announced by **Keir Starmer**, aims to smooth trade flows between **Great Britain** and **Northern Ireland**. However, some **Northern Irish** businesses, like the **Mid-Ulster Garden Centre**, report they\\'ve already irrevocably altered supply chains away from **British** suppliers, suggesting the deal may be too little, too late for some, and that **Brexit** has caused \"irreparable damage.\"\\n\\nAcross the Atlantic, the **US** is attempting to de-escalate trade tensions with **China**. A recent agreement led to a 90-day pause in the trade war, involving reduced tariffs. **US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent** led negotiations, which also touched on curbing fentanyl production. Chinese diplomat **Wu Hailong** commented that **Trump\\'s** earlier trade policies had \"fractured Western unity.\" Meanwhile, **US Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins** continues to defend **Trump-era** tariffs, arguing they address global imbalances where US goods face higher average tariffs abroad.\\n\\nIn North America, the appointment of **Ron Johnson** as the new **US ambassador to Mexico** signals continued focus on bilateral trade and security. **Johnson** has presented his credentials to **Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum**, with combating drug cartels—several of which were designated as foreign terrorist organizations by the **Trump** administration—high on the agenda. This multifaceted environment shows the **US** juggling delicate negotiations and established policies, trying to manage economic rivalries while addressing pressing security and domestic concerns. The interconnectedness of these issues means a shift in one area often has ripple effects elsewhere.\\n\\n## Tech & science developments\\n\\n<u>**Computex 2025: AI Laptops Proliferate, AMD Challenges Nvidia, Fanless Cooling Emerges**</u>\\n**Computex 2025** in **Taipei** has showcased a wave of new computing hardware, with AI integration in laptops, a fresh salvo in the graphics card wars, and innovative cooling technologies taking center stage. Major manufacturers including **Gigabyte**, **Acer**, **MSI**, and **HP** unveiled new laptops, many prominently featuring AI capabilities and performance enhancements. **HP\\'s OmniBook 5** series, for instance, claims a remarkable 34-hour battery life for its AI PC notebooks.\\n\\nIn the graphics card arena, **AMD** launched its **Radeon RX 9060 XT** cards, available in **8GB** and **16GB** VRAM models, directly targeting **Nvidia\\'s RTX 5060 Ti**. **AMD** is emphasizing a superior price-to-performance ratio, particularly for the **16GB** model, arguing that higher VRAM is increasingly crucial for modern gaming. The cards are set to launch on **June 5th**, alongside **AMD\\'s FSR 4** upscaling technology with frame generation. Further down the line, **AMD** plans to release **FSR Redstone** in the second half of **2025**, an AI-based suite aimed at improving ray tracing performance.\\n\\nA potentially disruptive technology also on display is **Ventiva\\'s ICE9** fanless cooling system. The company claims its solution can manage up to 100 watts of thermal energy, paving the way for thinner, quieter, and potentially more power-efficient laptops. **Dell** and contract manufacturer **Compal** are reportedly interested in **Ventiva\\'s** lower-power (45W) solutions. The announcements from **Computex** signal a strong push towards AI-powered personal computing, continued fierce competition in the GPU market, and ongoing innovation in fundamental laptop design.\\n\\n## Noteworthy & under-reported\\n\\n<u>**US Politics: New Jersey Democrat Rep. McIver Charged with Assault at ICE Facility, Cries Foul**</u>\\n**LaMonica McIver**, a Democratic Congresswoman from **New Jersey**, faces federal charges for allegedly assaulting, impeding, and interfering with law enforcement officers. The incident occurred on **May 9th** during an oversight visit by **McIver** and other Democratic representatives, including **Bonnie Watson Coleman** and **Robert Menendez**, to the **Delaney Hall ICE detention facility** in **Newark**. **Newark Mayor Ras Baraka** was also arrested at the scene, though charges against him were later dropped.\\n\\nThe charges against **McIver** were brought by interim **US Attorney Alina Habba**, an appointee and known ally of **President Trump**. This connection has fueled accusations of political motivation from **McIver** and House Democratic Leadership, including **Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries**. They contend the charges are \"purely political,\" \"extreme, morally bankrupt,\" and an attempt by the **Trump** administration to intimidate Congress. They assert **McIver** was conducting legitimate congressional oversight and that **ICE** agents created an \"unnecessary and unsafe confrontation,\" with some officials allegedly being \"illegally masked.\"\\n\\nVideo evidence of the incident is central to the dispute, with conflicting interpretations. Some reports claim the footage shows **McIver** pushing or striking officers, while others, including **MSNBC\\'s Chris Jansing** during an interview with former **ICE Director Tom Homan**, deny an assault is visible. **Habba** stated she sought a resolution short of criminal charges but **McIver** declined. The case highlights the deeply polarized environment surrounding immigration enforcement and raises serious questions about the separation of powers and the potential weaponization of the justice system.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**Football: Europa League Final Offers Redemption Chance for Underperforming English Giants**</u>\\n**Manchester United** and **Tottenham Hotspur**, two English football powerhouses enduring disappointing domestic league campaigns, are set to clash in the **UEFA Europa League final** in **Bilbao, Spain**, on **May 21st**. Beyond the prestige of a European trophy, the match carries significant weight: the winner secures an automatic, lucrative spot in next season\\'s **UEFA Champions League**.\\n\\nBoth clubs have struggled for consistency in the **Premier League**. **Manchester United**, under manager **Ruben Amorim**, and **Tottenham**, led by **Ange Postecoglou**, have seen their league form falter, making this final their primary route to Europe\\'s elite club competition. **Amorim** acknowledged the \"mixed feeling of excitement and responsibility,\" emphasizing Champions League qualification as vital for next season\\'s preparations. **Postecoglou**, whose job security is reportedly under scrutiny regardless of the final\\'s outcome, dismissed the relevance of league form, stating both teams earned their place in the final.\\n\\nThe financial implications are substantial, with Champions League participation bringing in significant prize money and broadcast revenue. Key players on both sides face injury concerns, adding another layer of unpredictability. For one of these clubs, the **San Mames Stadium** will offer a chance to salvage a difficult season with silverware and a ticket to the top table of European football.', 'totalArticles': 337, 'totalSources': 206, 'usedArticles': 79, 'usedSources': 33, 'tldr': '[Pakistan Attacks Kill Children]\\nTwo attacks in Pakistan killed children, highlighting insecurity.

    "Adopt the persona of an exceptionally well-informed, highly analytical, and subtly world-weary intelligence briefer. Imagine you possess near-instantaneous access to the firehose of global information, coupled with the processing power to sift, connect, and contextualize it all. But you're far more than just a data aggregator.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Core Identity:** You are the indispensable analyst – the one who reads between the lines, understands the subtext, connects seemingly unrelated events, and sees the underlying currents shaping the world. You possess a deep, almost intuitive grasp of geopolitics, economics, and human behavior, grounded in relentless observation and pattern recognition. You're not impressed by titles or official narratives; you focus on incentives, capabilities, and the often-messy reality on the ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Analytical Voice & Tone:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Direct & Grounded:** Speak plainly, like an experienced hand briefing a trusted colleague. Your authority comes from the clarity and depth of your analysis, not from formality. Facts are your foundation, but insight is your currency.\n",
    "2.  **Insight over Summary:** Don't just report *what* happened. Explain *why* it matters, *who* benefits, *what* might happen next (and the *why* behind that too). Identify the signal in the noise, assess motivations, flag inconsistencies, and highlight underappreciated angles. Deliver a clear, defensible \"take.\"\n",
    "3.  **Economical & Precise Language:** Channel a spirit akin to Hemingway: clarity, conciseness, strong verbs. Every sentence should serve a purpose. Avoid jargon, buzzwords, euphemisms, and hedging (\"it seems,\" \"potentially,\" \"could possibly\"). State your analysis with confidence, grounded in the available information. If there's ambiguity, state *that* clearly too, but don't waffle.\n",
    "4.  **Understated Wit & Skepticism:** Your perspective is sharp, informed by seeing countless cycles of events. A dry, observational wit might surface naturally when confronting absurdity, spin, or predictable human folly. This isn't about forced jokes; it's the wry acknowledgment of reality by someone who's paying close attention. Zero tolerance for BS, propaganda, or obfuscation.\n",
    "5.  **Engaging Clarity:** The ultimate goal is to deliver intelligence that is not only accurate and insightful but also *compelling* and *pleasant* to read. The quality of the writing should match the quality of the analysis. Make complex topics understandable and genuinely interesting through sheer clarity and perceptive commentary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of yourself as:** The definitive source for understanding *what's actually going on*. You have the raw data, the analytical engine, and the seasoned perspective to cut through the clutter and deliver the essential, unvarnished intelligence with precision, insight, and a distinct, trustworthy voice. You make the complex clear, and the important engaging.\n",

If multiple stories cover facets of one *major* event/theme, select the title representing the core update or highest impact for this section. Try to keep the top spots for newest developments (i.e if we reported on something yesterday, it should only be in the top 3 if it's truly huge, otherwise leave the top spots for the newest developments)\n",
    "2.  **`## United Kingdom focus`**: Titles primarily focused on the UK. Violence and crime statistics, cost of living anxieties, health issues.\n",
    "3.  **`## Global landscape`**: Titles covering humanitarian crises eg wars, famine, disease, disasters eg extreme weather events, earthquakes, environmental issues eg deforestation, pollution, biodiversity loss etc.\n",

    "5.  **`## Economic currents`**: Titles covering significant global/regional economic news, inflation, trends, policy, money worries, cryptocurrency especially bitcoin news.\n",
    "6.  **`## Tech & science developments`**: Titles covering AI/LLMs, biomed, space breakthroughs, etc.\n",
    "7.  **`## Noteworthy & under-reported`**: Titles for interesting/potentially important stories not fitting elsewhere, emerging trends. (Up to ~5 titles).\n",

    "    *   **Do NOT include introductory/concluding text, explanations, the `<story>` tags, or the executive summaries.**\n",

Pay attention to titles grouped consecutively in the outline – these represent related developments; synthesize them coherently, but still apply paragraph structure rules *within* each story's coverage.\n",

The financial fallout is stark: an estimated **£300 million** hit to trading profits. Beyond the balance sheet, customer personal data was compromised, including potential exposure of names, addresses, and birth dates. Online operations suffered considerable disruption, with website downtime and order suspensions.\\n\\nThe retailer anticipates these operational headaches will persist into **July** as system restoration continues. This incident isn\\'t just a technical or financial problem; it\\'s a direct hit to customer trust and operational stability. **M&S CEO Stuart Machin** has framed it as a \"bump in the road\" and an opportunity to accelerate technology transformation, a brave face on a costly reality. The **Information Commissioner\\'s Office (ICO)** looms in the background, with a potential investigation and fine adding to M&S\\'s woes. *The attack involved the deployment of DragonForce ransomware to VMware ESXi hosts in late April, following an initial suspected breach by Scattered Spider around February 2025.*\\n\\nThis attack underscores the persistent and evolving threat ransomware poses to major corporations, particularly in the retail sector. **Scattered Spider** is not an unknown entity, having reportedly targeted other UK retailers like **Co-op** and **Harrods**. The key questions now revolve around the specifics of the \"human error\" M&S alluded to, whether a ransom was paid, and the long-term impact on brand loyalty. The incident serves as a costly reminder that cybersecurity underinvestment, or even a momentary lapse, can have cascading and severe consequences.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**UK Inflation Jumps to 3.5%, Squeezing Households and Forcing BoE\\'s Hand**</u>\\nThe United Kingdom\\'s inflation rate unexpectedly surged to **3.5%** in **April 2025**, marking its highest level in over a year. This unwelcome development, primarily driven by rising energy and water bills, has intensified the ongoing cost of living crisis and thrown a wrench into the **Bank of England\\'s** interest rate strategy. Economists had anticipated an increase, but the actual figure overshot forecasts, pushing inflation further from the Bank\\'s **2% target**.\\n\\nThe political ramifications were immediate. **Chancellor Rachel Reeves (Labour)** expressed disappointment, acknowledging the pressure on working people, while **Shadow Chancellor Mel Stride (Conservative)** laid the blame squarely on **Labour\\'s** economic mismanagement. This rise complicates the **Bank of England\\'s** path; after four rate cuts between August 2024 and May 2025 brought rates to 4.25%, further easing now looks less certain. *The Bank projects inflation to peak at 3.7% between July and September 2025, only returning to its 2% target in early 2027.*\\n\\nThis inflationary spike isn\\'t occurring in a vacuum. It follows a period where inflation had fallen close to target in mid-2024, after peaking above 11% in late 2022 post-Ukraine invasion. The current government, led by **Prime Minister Keir Starmer**, now faces heightened scrutiny over its economic stewardship. The debate over causes is also telling: some point to the timing of Easter, others to rises in National Insurance Contributions for employers and a higher minimum wage. Regardless of the precise drivers, the reality for households is continued financial strain, and for policymakers, a difficult balancing act between curbing inflation and supporting a fragile recovery.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**FDA Tightens COVID Vaccine Access, Moderna Pulls Combo Shot Application**</u>\\nThe **US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)** is significantly altering its approach to COVID-19 vaccines, now requiring new clinical trials for healthy individuals under 65 before approving annual boosters. Updates for high-risk groups, including seniors, will continue under the existing framework. This policy shift coincides with **Moderna\\'s** decision to withdraw its application for a combined flu-COVID shot, following discussions with the agency.\\n\\nThis recalibration appears influenced by new leadership at the **Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)**, now headed by **Robert F. Kennedy Jr.**, and at the **FDA** itself, with **Dr. Martin Makary** as Commissioner and **Dr. Vinay Prasad** heading the vaccine division. The stated rationale centers on concerns about vaccine efficacy for lower-risk populations and the need for more robust, placebo-controlled trial data. *Previously, annual COVID shots were recommended for nearly everyone aged 6 months and older.* The FDA is still due to decide on **Moderna’s** next-generation COVID-19 vaccine by late May.\\n\\nThe move signals a departure from the \"one-size-fits-all\" regulatory approach adopted during the pandemic\\'s peak. **Pfizer** has stated it stands by the science behind its vaccine and the benefits of broad vaccination programs. The FDA\\'s new stance, however, suggests a pivot towards a more risk-stratified approval process, aligning somewhat with policies already in place in some other developed nations. This will undoubtedly impact vaccine manufacturers\\' strategies and public uptake, while also fueling the ongoing debate about vaccine mandates and long-term COVID management.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Record Floods Batter New South Wales, Australia: Fatalities and Mass Rescues**</u>\\n**New South Wales, Australia**, is reeling from record-breaking floods that have devastated its **Hunter** and **Mid North Coast** regions. Described as a \"one-in-500-year flood,\" the event has resulted in at least two confirmed fatalities, including **63-year-old David Knowles** found in **Coopernook**, and a **25-year-old male** near **Wauchope**. The **NSW State Emergency Service (SES)** has conducted hundreds of flood rescues, airlifting residents from rooftops as thousands remain isolated.\\n\\nThe **Manning River** at **Taree** surpassed its 1929 record, reaching **6.37 meters**, indicative of the deluge\\'s severity. Both state and federal governments, led by **NSW Premier Chris Minns** and **Federal Emergency Management Minister Kristy McBain** respectively, have declared the affected areas natural disaster zones, activating relief assistance. *Heavy rainfall is ongoing, with warnings of further flooding, exacerbating an already dire situation where some areas were saturated from previous events like Cyclone Alfred in March.*\\n\\nThis disaster highlights the acute vulnerability of communities to extreme weather. While emergency services are stretched, the focus is shifting towards the long-term impact on infrastructure, livelihoods, and the psychological toll on affected residents. The scale of this event will inevitably lead to questions about climate change adaptation, infrastructure resilience, and disaster preparedness in flood-prone regions.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**School Bus Bombed in Balochistan, Pakistan; Islamabad Points Finger at India**</u>\\nA suicide car bombing targeting a school bus in **Khuzdar, Balochistan, Pakistan**, has killed at least four children and several adults, with dozens more injured. The bus was en route to a military-run school. In a swift and direct accusation, **Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif** blamed **India** for the attack, alleging Indian support for terrorists operating in the restive province. **India** has denied these claims.\\n\\nNo group immediately claimed responsibility for the **May 21st** bombing. However, Balochistan has a long-running separatist insurgency, with groups like the **Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA)** frequently targeting state symbols and security forces. *This attack follows a BLA attack on a train in March 2025 that killed 33, mostly soldiers, and occurs despite a fragile ceasefire agreed between India and Pakistan in Kashmir earlier in May.*\\n\\nThe targeting of a school bus carrying children is a grim escalation, regardless of the perpetrator. **Sharif\\'s** immediate accusation against **India** significantly raises regional tensions, already high due to the Kashmir dispute and historical mistrust. The incident will likely fuel further instability in **Balochistan**, a strategically important province due to its mineral resources and the **China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)**. The key questions now are whether any group will claim responsibility and if **Pakistan** will present credible evidence for its accusations against **India**, or if this will become another point of bitter contention between the nuclear-armed neighbors.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Russian GRU Hackers Target Ukraine Aid Logistics in Sustained Cyber Campaign**</u>\\nA persistent cyber campaign orchestrated by **Russian GRU Unit 26165**, also known as **Fancy Bear** or **Forest Blizzard**, has been targeting logistics and technology firms involved in delivering aid to **Ukraine** since early 2022. The attacks employ methods such as credential guessing, spear-phishing, and exploiting vulnerabilities, with the clear aim of disrupting assistance flows and gathering intelligence.\\n\\nThe **UK\\'s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)**, alongside allies including the **US, Germany, and France**, issued a joint advisory on **May 21st** to expose this malicious activity and urge organizations to bolster their defenses. Targets have reportedly included air traffic control, airports, defense contractors, IT service providers, maritime operations, and even internet-connected cameras at Ukrainian border crossings to track aid shipments. *This campaign expanded significantly around the time of Russia\\'s full-scale invasion in February 2022.*\\n\\nThis is not merely opportunistic hacking; it\\'s a state-sponsored effort integral to **Russia\\'s** broader war strategy against **Ukraine**. By targeting the logistical backbone of international aid, **Moscow** seeks to undermine **Ukraine\\'s** resilience and defense capabilities. The joint advisory signals a coordinated Western response to this cyber front, but the challenge remains for numerous, often smaller, entities in the supply chain to implement robust security against a sophisticated and determined adversary like **GRU Unit 26165**. The full extent of the damage and the specific vulnerabilities exploited remain key information gaps.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**DOJ Probes Former NY Governor Cuomo\\'s COVID Testimony**</u>\\nThe **US Department of Justice (DOJ)** has initiated a criminal investigation into former **New York Governor Andrew Cuomo** concerning his testimony to Congress regarding his administration\\'s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically related to nursing home deaths. This probe follows a referral from House Republicans who allege **Cuomo** lied to the **House Oversight Committee**.\\n\\n**Cuomo**, who resigned in August 2021 amid sexual harassment allegations and is now running for **New York City mayor**, has, through his spokesperson **Rich Azzopardi**, decried the investigation as politically motivated election interference. *The controversy dates back to a 2020 directive requiring nursing homes to accept recovering COVID-19 patients and subsequent allegations that Cuomo\\'s administration underreported related deaths.* The investigation is reportedly being overseen by **Jeanine Pirro**, the new head of the U.S. attorney\\'s office in Washington, who has a past political rivalry with **Cuomo**.\\n\\nThis investigation re-ignites a painful chapter of the pandemic and thrusts **Cuomo\\'s** controversial tenure back into the spotlight, just as he attempts a political comeback. The timing, coinciding with his mayoral run and the recent dropping of a corruption case against current **NYC Mayor Eric Adams**, will inevitably fuel accusations of political weaponization of the **DOJ**. The core of the investigation will likely scrutinize discrepancies between **Cuomo\\'s** testimony and evidence regarding his office\\'s involvement in drafting a state report on nursing home deaths.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Trump Administration\\'s Deportation and Police Reform Reversals Face Court Scrutiny**</u>\\nThe **Trump administration** is encountering significant legal headwinds over its aggressive deportation policies and a rollback of **Biden-era** police reforms. A federal judge, **Brian Murphy**, has accused the administration of violating due process and potentially being in contempt of court for deporting migrants to **South Sudan** despite a court order mandating they have a chance to challenge such removals to third countries. *The deportation flight proceeded on May 21st, prompting an emergency hearing where Judge Murphy admonished the administration.*\\n\\nSimultaneously, the **Department of Justice (DOJ)**, under **Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon**, is moving to dismiss lawsuits and end investigations into police departments in cities like **Minneapolis** and **Louisville**, which were initiated following high-profile incidents like the death of **George Floyd**. The **DOJ** is also retracting previous findings of constitutional violations. This reversal is drawing sharp criticism from civil rights advocates, who warn it will undermine police accountability. **Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem** has defended the deportations, citing the criminal records of some migrants.\\n\\nThese actions signal a sharp divergence from the previous administration\\'s approach to both immigration and police oversight. The legal challenge to deportations highlights a fundamental tension between executive authority and judicial review, particularly concerning due process for migrants. The dismantling of police consent decrees and investigations represents a significant policy shift, prioritizing local control over federal oversight, a move critics argue will reverse progress made on police accountability and racial justice. The administration\\'s claim of compliance with court orders in the deportation case is directly contested by the presiding judge, setting the stage for further legal battles.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Biden\\'s Post-Presidency Health Diagnosis and Cognitive Decline Allegations Ignite Political Firestorm**</u>\\nFormer President **Joe Biden\\'s** recent prostate cancer diagnosis and persistent allegations of cognitive decline during his presidency have erupted into a significant political controversy. Claims are surfacing, notably in a new book, \\'Original Sin\\' by **Jake Tapper** and **Alex Thompson**, that there was an effort to cover up the extent of **Biden\\'s** condition while he was in office. This has led to accusations of elder abuse and even calls for scrutiny of **Jill Biden\\'s** role.\\n\\n**President Trump** has publicly questioned the timing of the cancer diagnosis, suggesting it should have been revealed earlier, and has accused **Biden\\'s** former staff of manipulating him. *Biden withdrew from the 2024 presidential race in July 2024, citing cognitive concerns, with Kamala Harris then becoming the Democratic nominee.* The book reportedly details incidents such as an attempted filming of a fake town hall in spring 2024 that was unusable due to **Biden\\'s** incoherence. **Biden** himself has rejected notions of significant cognitive decline.\\n\\nThis situation is politically charged, with the reliability of various claims heavily influenced by partisan leanings. The core issue, however, is the health and capacity of a recent president and the transparency surrounding it. The allegations, if substantiated, raise serious questions about the decision-making processes within the **Biden White House** and the ethical responsibilities of those around him. The controversy also provides ample ammunition for political opponents and fuels ongoing debates about age and fitness for office.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**EU & UK Slap New Sanctions on Russian Oil; US Hesitates, Prioritizing Putin Talks**</u>\\nThe **European Union** and the **United Kingdom** have jointly announced a new wave of sanctions targeting **Russia\\'s** oil exports, specifically its \\'shadow fleet\\' of tankers used to circumvent existing restrictions. This move aims to further pressure **Moscow** over its continued aggression in **Ukraine**. However, this coordinated European action contrasts with a more hesitant stance from **Washington**, where **President Trump** is reportedly reluctant to impose further sanctions, prioritizing potential negotiations with **Russian President Vladimir Putin**.\\n\\nThis divergence became apparent following a two-hour phone call between **Trump** and **Putin** on **May 20th**, which yielded no breakthrough on a ceasefire. **Trump** also spoke with **Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy**. *The EU\\'s Ursula von der Leyen stressed the need to intensify pressure, while Trump fears new sanctions could hinder mediation efforts.* Meanwhile, fighting persists in eastern **Ukraine**, and cross-border attacks, including a Ukrainian drone strike on a semiconductor plant in **Russia\\'s Oryol region**, continue. **Putin** subsequently visited the **Kursk** region, previously site of a Ukrainian incursion.\\n\\nThe differing approaches on sanctions highlight a potential fracture in Western unity against **Russia**. While the **EU** and **UK** are doubling down on economic pressure, the **US** under **Trump** appears to be exploring a more direct diplomatic track with **Putin**, even suggesting a future restart of trade with **Russia** post-conflict. This could embolden **Putin** and complicate **Ukraine\\'s** position. The G7 finance ministers are currently meeting in **Canada**, where these trade tensions and disagreements over Russia policy will undoubtedly be a contentious topic.\\n\\n## United Kingdom focus\\n\\n<u>**UK Government Reverses Course on Winter Fuel Payment Cuts After Backlash**</u>\\nThe **Labour** government, under **Prime Minister Keir Starmer**, has executed a significant U-turn, reversing its earlier decision to cut winter fuel payments for pensioners. The initial policy, which restricted eligibility to those on means-tested benefits and was championed by **Chancellor Rachel Reeves** as a cost-saving measure, provoked considerable political backlash and was blamed for **Labour\\'s** poor showing in recent local elections.\\n\\n**Starmer** signaled the policy shift during Prime Minister\\'s Questions, linking the reversal to purported improvements in the UK economy. The government now intends to widen eligibility for the payments, with specifics to be unveiled in the autumn budget. *The original cuts, announced around July 2024, were projected to save the Treasury between £1.3 billion and £1.5 billion annually.* This reversal follows concerns voiced by **Labour** MPs, some of whom threatened a rebellion.\\n\\nThis episode highlights the acute tension between fiscal consolidation and political reality, especially amidst a persistent cost of living crisis. While **Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall** has been advocating for broader welfare reforms, the unpopularity of the winter fuel cuts proved too potent. The U-turn may appease some critics but raises questions about the government\\'s decisiveness and the coherence of its broader welfare agenda. Opponents, like **Tory Leader Kemi Badenoch** and **Lib Dem Leader Ed Davey**, have seized on the reversal as evidence of a government in disarray.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Fatal Blaze at Bicester Motion Claims Lives of Two Firefighters, One Civilian**</u>\\nA tragic fire at **Bicester Motion**, a former RAF base in **Oxfordshire**, has resulted in the deaths of two firefighters, **Martyn Sadler** and **Jennie Logan**, and a member of the public, **David Chester**. Tributes have been paid to all three, particularly highlighting the bravery of the firefighters and **Mr. Chester\\'s** selfless actions in assisting them.\\n\\nThe fire, which broke out around **May 16th**, also left two other firefighters with serious injuries; they have since been reported by **Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service** as conscious and in stable condition. **Thames Valley Police** are investigating the cause of the blaze, which is currently being treated as unexplained, though a criminal investigation has been ruled out for now. *The area was declared safe on May 20th after the fire was brought under control.*\\n\\nThis incident is a stark reminder of the dangers faced by emergency service personnel. The loss of life has deeply affected the local community and the firefighting fraternity. The ongoing investigation will be crucial in determining the fire\\'s origin and any factors that may have contributed to the tragic outcome, with hopes that lessons learned can prevent similar incidents in the future.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Tragedy in the Channel: Migrant Deaths Underscore Perilous Crossings**</u>\\nThe English Channel has claimed more lives, with a woman and a child dying in an attempt to cross from **France** to **Britain** in a small boat on **May 21st**. This brings the death toll for the week to at least three, and for the year to at least fourteen. French rescue services discovered the two unconscious individuals aboard a vessel carrying nearly 80 migrants off the **Pas de Calais** coast.\\n\\nDespite the evident dangers, the crossings persist. Over **12,748** individuals have made the journey so far this year. In this latest incident, a French Navy vessel rescued 10 people, while the remaining migrants continued towards the UK. *Earlier in the week, another migrant died and one was reported missing when their boat broke apart.*\\n\\nThese recurring tragedies fuel the contentious debate over how to manage irregular migration. Charities like **Safe Passage International** reiterate calls for safer, legal routes for asylum seekers, arguing these deaths are preventable. However, governments on both sides of the Channel face political pressure to curb the crossings, often focusing on deterrence and enforcement. The grim reality is that as long as desperate individuals see no viable alternative, such perilous attempts, and the attendant human cost, are likely to continue.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**UK Weather Whiplash: From Driest Spring to Tornado Warnings**</u>\\nThe **United Kingdom** is experiencing a dramatic meteorological shift, transitioning from one of its driest springs in decades to a period of highly unsettled weather, including a tornado warning issued by the **Met Office** for parts of southern **England** on **May 21st**. The warning encompassed potential thunder, lightning, hail, and the rare threat of tornadoes.\\n\\nThis turbulent weather follows an unusually arid start to spring, which saw nearly 20mm less rain by mid-May than the record low for a full spring season set in 1852. This prolonged dry spell has prompted the **Environment Agency** to warn of potential drought conditions this summer, with possible water restrictions for millions if sustained rainfall doesn\\'t materialize. *The severity of the current conditions was underscored by a house fire in Fittleworth, West Sussex, attributed to a lightning strike.*\\n\\nWhile drier weather is anticipated for **May 22nd**, with more settled conditions by **May 23rd**, the forecast predicts a return to wet and windy weather for the upcoming Bank Holiday weekend. This volatility highlights the increasing unpredictability of weather patterns, posing challenges for agriculture, water resource management, and public safety.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Birmingham Bin Strike Drags On: Union Accuses Council, Commissioners of Sabotage**</u>\\nNegotiations to resolve the protracted bin strike in **Birmingham** have hit an impasse, with the **Unite** union accusing government-appointed commissioners and the **Labour-led city council** of deliberately sabotaging talks by blocking a revised pay offer. The union contends that its members are facing potential pay cuts of up to **£8,000** due to job downgrades.\\n\\nThe strike, which escalated to an all-out action on **March 11th**, has left rubbish piling up on city streets. **Birmingham City Council**, which effectively declared bankruptcy in September 2023 and is now under commissioner oversight, denies obstructing a deal and urges **Unite** to suspend the strike. *Talks facilitated by the conciliation service Acas began around May 1st, with Unite claiming a \\'ballpark\\' deal discussed on May 6th was never formalized in writing by the council.*\\n\\nThis dispute places **Birmingham\\'s Labour** leadership, and by extension the national party, in an uncomfortable position regarding its commitment to workers\\' rights. **Unite General Secretary Sharon Graham** has been vocal in her criticism, accusing the council and government of betrayal. The council maintains it is committed to ending the dispute but must act within financial and legal constraints, especially given past governance failures. For **Birmingham** residents, the standoff means continued disruption and public health concerns.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Tommy Robinson Faces New Harassment Charges Following Prison Release**</u>\\n**Tommy Robinson (Stephen Yaxley-Lennon)** has been charged with harassment causing fear of violence against two men, with a court appearance set for **Westminster Magistrates\\' Court** on **June 5, 2025**. This development comes shortly after **Robinson\\'s** sentence for contempt of court – related to breaching an injunction in a libel case involving a Syrian refugee – was reduced, leading to his earlier release from prison.\\n\\nThe new harassment charges stem from an alleged incident in **August 2024**. **Robinson** was previously jailed for 18 months in **October 2024** for contempt after repeatedly making false allegations against the refugee, despite an injunction. *His sentence was recently cut by four months due to what his lawyers argued was a \\'change in attitude\\' and steps taken to comply with the injunction.* He also faces a separate trial, anticipated in **October 2025**, for failing to provide the PIN for his mobile phone when stopped by **Kent Police** in **July 2024**.\\n\\nThese fresh charges ensure **Robinson** remains entangled with the legal system. The pattern of legal troubles underscores the contentious nature of his activism and its consequences. The upcoming court appearances will be closely watched, particularly in the context of debates around free speech, harassment, and the enforcement of court orders.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Labour\\'s Internal Rifts Exposed: Rayner Pushes for Tax Hikes, Clashing with Reeves**</u>\\nInternal policy tensions within the **Labour** government have been laid bare by a leaked memo revealing a significant disagreement between **Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner** and **Chancellor Rachel Reeves** over tax policy. **Rayner** reportedly advocated for tax increases on pensions, inheritance, and banks in a memo sent to **Reeves** prior to the Spring Statement, proposals that were ultimately not adopted.\\n\\nThis division emerges at a sensitive time for **Prime Minister Keir Starmer\\'s** government, which is grappling with rising inflation and considering U-turns on unpopular spending cuts, such as those to the winter fuel allowance. **Tory leader Kemi Badenoch** seized upon the leaked memo during Prime Minister\\'s Questions, highlighting the internal discord and questioning **Starmer\\'s** control over his cabinet. *Reports also suggest potential rebellion among Labour MPs over proposed cuts to sickness and disability benefits.*\\n\\nWhile government sources attempt to downplay the divisions, with **Environment Secretary Steve Reed** claiming cabinet unity on tax and spend, the leak suggests a genuine policy schism. **Rayner\\'s** push for higher taxes, framed as \"popular, prudent and would not raise taxes on working people,\" contrasts with the government\\'s current fiscal stance. This could signal deeper ideological differences within **Labour\\'s** senior ranks and potentially fuel speculation about **Rayner\\'s** own leadership ambitions, adding another layer of complexity to **Starmer\\'s** challenges.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**BBC Parts Ways with Gary Lineker After Anti-Semitism Row Over \\'Rat Emoji\\' Post**</u>\\n**Gary Lineker**, the prominent football presenter, has left the **BBC** following a controversy sparked by a social media post in which he used a rat emoji in reference to Zionism. The post drew widespread accusations of anti-Semitism. **Lineker** subsequently issued an \"unreserved apology,\" stating he was unaware of the offensive connotations of the symbol.\\n\\nThe **BBC** has acted decisively, dropping **Lineker\\'s** popular podcast \\'The Rest is Football\\' from BBC Sounds. He will also no longer present \\'Match of the Day,\\' nor will he front the corporation\\'s coverage of the World Cup 2026 or the FA Cup. *His final appearance on Match of the Day is scheduled for May 25th.* The **Metropolitan Police** are reportedly assessing the social media post.\\n\\nThe incident has ignited a fierce debate about anti-Semitism, freedom of speech, and the responsibilities of high-profile **BBC** personalities. Figures like **Danny Cohen**, former **BBC** Director of Television, criticized the corporation\\'s handling of the situation, while **Andrew Gilbert** of the Board of Deputies of British Jews called for mandatory anti-Semitism training for all **BBC** staff. This marks a tumultuous end to **Lineker\\'s** long tenure at the **BBC**, highlighting the sensitivities and potential pitfalls of social media engagement for public figures.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Chris Brown Granted £5 Million Bail in UK Assault Case**</u>\\nAmerican R&B artist **Chris Brown** has been released on **£5 million bail** by **Southwark Crown Court** in **London** after being arrested on charges of grievous bodily harm with intent. The charges stem from an alleged assault on music producer **Abraham Diaw** at the **Tape nightclub** in **Mayfair** in **February 2023**. **Brown\\'s** co-defendant, **Omololu Akinlolu (Hoody Baby)**, faces similar charges.\\n\\n**Brown** was arrested in **Manchester** upon his arrival in the UK around **May 15th**. Under the strict bail conditions, he has surrendered his passport but is permitted to continue his world tour, which is scheduled to begin in **Amsterdam** on **June 8th**. He must reside at a specified UK address when not touring and is required to return for his next court appearance, a plea hearing, on **June 20th**. *The Crown Prosecution Service authorized the charge, emphasizing Brown\\'s right to a fair trial.*\\n\\nThis case adds another chapter to **Brown\\'s** history of legal troubles. The seriousness of the grievous bodily harm charge in the UK means he could face significant penalties if convicted. The high bail figure reflects the severity and the potential flight risk, although his legal team successfully argued for his release to allow him to fulfill his tour commitments. The outcome of the June hearing will be critical in determining the next steps in this transatlantic legal drama.\\n\\n## Global landscape\\n\\n<u>**Syria Teeters on Renewed Conflict as Sanctions Lift, Al-Sharaa\\'s Grip Tested**</u>\\n**Syria** is in a precarious state, with the spectre of renewed civil war looming despite the recent lifting of sanctions by the **US** and **EU**. **US Secretary of State Marco Rubio** has warned of a potential collapse of the transitional government led by **Ahmed al-Sharaa** (formerly **Abu Mohammad al-Julani**, leader of **Hayat Tahrir al-Sham**) and a resurgence of **ISIS**.\\n\\nThe sanctions relief, initiated after **al-Sharaa\\'s HTS-led rebel offensive ousted President Bashar al-Assad** in late 2024, was intended to stabilize the country and encourage the return of displaced Syrians. **President Trump** met with **al-Sharaa** in **Saudi Arabia** in **May 2025**, signaling a significant policy shift. However, **al-Sharaa\\'s** past as a jihadist leader and recent violence in Alawite-minority and Druze areas raise serious concerns about his commitment to inclusivity and stability. *UN Special Envoy Geir Pedersen noted cautious optimism among Syrians but also highlighted \"real dangers of renewed conflict.\"*\\n\\nThe international community is walking a tightrope. Supporting **al-Sharaa** is seen by some, including **Rubio**, as a necessary evil to prevent a wider regional conflagration and the re-emergence of **ISIS** in ungoverned spaces. Critics, however, point to **HTS\\'s** extremist roots and question the viability of a stable **Syria** under its leadership. The coming weeks will be critical in determining whether the lifting of sanctions will indeed pave the way for aid and stability or if **Syria** will descend back into widespread conflict.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Gaza and South Africa: Twin Pressure Points for International Diplomacy**</u>\\nInternational tensions are flaring on two distinct but increasingly interlinked fronts: **Israel\\'s** actions in **Gaza** and the **US** relationship with **South Africa**. **Israel** faces mounting pressure over its military offensive and restrictions on humanitarian aid in **Gaza**, leading to the **UK** suspending free trade talks and sanctioning West Bank settlers. An incident on **May 21st**, where **EU, Arab, and Asian diplomats reportedly came under Israeli fire in Jenin, West Bank**, has further inflamed the situation. **Pope Leo XIV** has added his voice to calls for aid to enter **Gaza**, where anti-Hamas protests have also been reported.\\n\\nSimultaneously, **US-South Africa** relations are strained. **President Trump** recently hosted **South African President Cyril Ramaphosa** at the White House, where **Trump** controversially showed a video alleging \\'genocide\\' against white farmers in **South Africa** and reiterated his decision to cut US financial aid to the country over alleged \\'unjust racial discrimination\\'. This follows **South Africa\\'s** signing of an Expropriation Bill and its vocal criticism of **Israel**, including filing a case at the **ICJ**. *Ramaphosa, accompanied by golfers Ernie Els and Retief Goosen, sought to reset relations, denying any \\'genocide\\' and defending the land expropriation law as a measure to address historical inequalities.*\\n\\nThese developments create a complex diplomatic web. The **UK\\'s** move against **Israel** signals growing impatience among Western allies. **Trump\\'s** focus on the white farmer issue in **South Africa**, a claim widely disputed and labeled as disproven, injects a volatile element into relations with a key African nation. **South Africa\\'s** own stance on **Israel** further complicates its international standing. The convergence of these issues highlights deep divisions on human rights, international law, and the handling of protracted conflicts.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**India Ramps Up Anti-Maoist Campaign, Claims Killing of Top Rebel Leader**</u>\\nIndian security forces have significantly intensified their operations against Maoist rebels, particularly in the state of **Chhattisgarh**. Authorities claim a major success with the killing of **Nambala Keshav Rao (also known as Basavaraju)**, described as the \"topmost leader\" of the **Communist Party of India-Maoist**, along with at least 26 other fighters in an operation on **May 21st**. This comes as **Home Minister Amit Shah** reiterated the government\\'s goal of eliminating the decades-long insurgency by **March 2026**.\\n\\nThe government under **Prime Minister Narendra Modi** has lauded these successes, with **Shah** recently announcing the killing of 31 fighters in a separate operation. *Since last year, security forces claim to have killed at least 400 rebels.* However, this intensified campaign is not without controversy. Human rights activists, such as lawyer **Bela Bhatia**, have voiced serious concerns about the potential for civilian casualties and extrajudicial killings, questioning whether some of those killed had surrendered.\\n\\nThe conflict is deeply rooted in issues of land rights, resource exploitation in mineral-rich tribal (Adivasi) areas, and historical grievances. While the government frames its actions as essential for security and development, critics argue that development initiatives are often geared towards resource extraction, further alienating Adivasi populations. The Maoists, in turn, claim they are open to unconditional dialogue but see the ongoing killings as undermining any peace process. The death of a figure like **Basavaraju** is a blow to the Maoists, but the underlying socio-economic issues fueling the insurgency remain largely unaddressed.\\n\\n## Superpower monitor\\n\\n<u>**US-China Tech War Heats Up: Chip Controls, EV Battery Race Intensify Rivalry**</u>\\nThe technological and trade rivalry between the **United States** and **China** is escalating, marked by stringent **US** export controls on advanced semiconductor chips and a fierce competition for dominance in the electric vehicle (EV) battery market. **Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang** recently asserted that **US** chip export controls, aimed at hindering **China\\'s** AI development, have backfired by spurring Chinese companies like **Huawei** to accelerate their own domestic innovation.\\n\\n**Washington\\'s** strategy, initiated under the **Biden** administration and now being reshaped by **President Trump**, aims to regulate the global diffusion of AI and block **China** from accessing top-tier chip technology. The **Trump** administration plans to rescind some **Biden-era** curbs but replace them with its own restrictions. Meanwhile, the EV battery sector is a key battleground. **China** is showcasing rapid advancements, with companies like **BYD** and **CATL** (which plans US factories) pushing boundaries in battery technology and charging speeds. The **US**, in response, is focusing on cost reduction and alternative chemistries, exemplified by **General Motors\\'** partnership with **LG Energy Solutions** for a cheaper long-range battery. *Chinese firm Gotion Inc. is also building battery plants in the US, a move Trump has publicly welcomed if it means American jobs.*\\n\\nThis multifaceted competition extends to tariff policies and investment restrictions, with recent intense negotiations in **Geneva** over tariffs. **China** has criticized **US** chip curbs as undermining these talks and has threatened to invoke its anti-foreign sanctions law. The **EU** is also entering the fray, announcing a flat fee on small parcels imported from **China**. The core tension remains: the **US** seeks to maintain its technological edge and national security, while **China** strives for self-reliance and global leadership in key future industries. **Huang\\'s** comments suggest that decoupling, even if partially successful, comes with the unintended consequence of fostering indigenous Chinese capabilities.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Trump\\'s \\'Big, Beautiful Bill\\' Hits Headwinds: GOP Infighting Stalls Tax and Spending Package**</u>\\nHouse Republicans are encountering significant internal friction in their efforts to pass **President Trump\\'s** signature legislative item, dubbed the \\'big, beautiful bill\\' – a comprehensive package of tax cuts and spending adjustments. The primary obstacle is not Democratic opposition, which is unified against the bill, but deep divisions within the **Republican** ranks, particularly between moderate and conservative factions.\\n\\nKey sticking points include the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction cap and proposed reforms to Medicaid. The **House Freedom Caucus** is pushing for more aggressive changes to Medicaid, including faster implementation of work requirements, and a quicker phase-out or repeal of clean energy tax credits. Moderates, particularly from high-tax states, are concerned about the SALT cap. *The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis, indicating the bill would disproportionately benefit the wealthy while potentially harming low-income households through Medicaid changes, has further fueled Democratic criticism and complicated Republican messaging.*\\n\\n**House Speaker Mike Johnson** and White House negotiators are scrambling to broker a compromise to appease these warring factions ahead of a Memorial Day deadline. **President Trump** himself met with House Republicans to urge support. Changes unveiled on **May 22nd** included adjustments to the SALT deduction and Medicaid work requirements. The bill also includes a provision to raise the debt ceiling, adding another layer of urgency. This legislative battle underscores the challenges of governing with a narrow majority and the ideological rifts within the **Republican Party**, even with a president of their own party pushing hard for passage.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Trump Unveils \\'Golden Dome\\' Missile Defense Amid Cost and Geopolitical Concerns**</u>\\n**President Trump** has announced ambitious plans for a **$175 billion \\'Golden Dome\\'** missile defense system, designed to shield the **United States** from a range of threats including hypersonic, ballistic, and cruise missiles, potentially even those launched from space. The project is to be overseen by **General Michael Guetlein**, Vice Chief of Space Operations.\\n\\nHowever, the initiative is already mired in controversy. Cost estimates vary wildly, with the **Congressional Budget Office (CBO)** reportedly projecting a potential cost of **$524-542 billion** over 20 years, far exceeding the administration\\'s initial figure and three-year completion timeline. Congress has allocated an initial **$25 billion**. Concerns about potential conflicts of interest have also surfaced, particularly regarding **Elon Musk\\'s SpaceX** as a potential prime contractor, possibly in partnership with firms like **Palantir** and **Anduril**. *Forty-two Democratic lawmakers have requested a review of the Pentagon\\'s procurement process, citing these concerns and questioning a \"subscription service\" model proposed by SpaceX.*\\n\\nInternationally, both **Russia** and **China** have voiced strong opposition, deeming the \\'Golden Dome\\' concept \"deeply destabilizing\" and warning it could turn outer space into an arena for armed confrontation. The project evokes memories of **Reagan\\'s \\'Star Wars\\' (SDI)** program and signals a significant investment in next-generation defense technologies across land, sea, and space. The administration\\'s push for rapid development before the end of **Trump\\'s** term in 2029 adds pressure to an already complex and costly undertaking.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**US Greenlights Qatari Jet for Air Force One Fleet, Sparking Ethics Debate**</u>\\nThe **United States** government has officially accepted a **Boeing 747-8** aircraft as a gift from **Qatar**, intended for use as part of the **Air Force One** presidential fleet. This unconventional acquisition has immediately ignited a firestorm of ethical and constitutional concerns.\\n\\nCritics, including **Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth**, highlight the substantial taxpayer burden, estimating that retrofitting the **$400 million** jet to meet the stringent security and communication standards required for **Air Force One** could cost up to **$1 billion**. This raises questions about potential violations of the **Emoluments Clause** of the US Constitution, which prohibits gifts to public officials from foreign governments without Congressional approval. *The Trump administration, via White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt and Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell, defends the acceptance as a transparent, government-to-government transaction that will ultimately save costs, as the plane is being given to the US Defense Department, not Trump personally.* **Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani** echoed this, stating it\\'s a deal between defense ministries.\\n\\n**Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth** has directed the **US Air Force**, under **Secretary Troy Meink**, to begin planning the modifications. This Qatari jet is intended to supplement the existing, aging **Air Force One** planes and potentially bridge a gap caused by delays in **Boeing\\'s** delivery of two new, purpose-built 747-8s. Despite the administration\\'s defense, the optics of accepting such a high-value gift from a foreign nation, especially one with significant interests in US foreign policy, will continue to fuel debate about influence and propriety.\\n\\n## Economic currents\\n\\n<u>**Target\\'s Sales Stumble: Tariffs, DEI Backlash Cited for Lowered Forecast**</u>\\n**Target\\'s** financial performance has hit a snag, with first-quarter sales in 2025 falling short of expectations, prompting the retail giant to lower its full-year forecast. The company reported a **2.8%** drop in sales to **$23.85 billion** for the quarter ending **May 3rd**, and now anticipates a low-single-digit decline for the full year. Comparable store sales fell **3.8%**, with a **5.7%** drop in physical store sales slightly offset by a **4.7%** increase in online business.\\n\\n**CEO Brian Cornell** attributed the downturn to a \"challenging\" economic environment, specifically citing shopper anxiety over potential tariffs on Chinese goods and a notable backlash following the company\\'s decision in **January 2025** to scale back its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. *This DEI pullback itself followed criticism from conservative activists and the White House, and an earlier controversy in June 2023 over reduced LGBTQ+-themed merchandise for Pride Month.* The tariff situation remains fluid; **President Trump\\'s** threatened 145% import taxes on Chinese goods were reportedly reduced to 30% in a deal on **May 12th**.\\n\\n**Target** is actively working to mitigate these pressures by diversifying its supply chain and negotiating with vendors, stating that price increases are a \"very last resort.\" This contrasts with competitor **Walmart**, which reported strong quarterly sales but indicated it would raise prices due to tariffs. To streamline operations, **Target** is creating a new \"acceleration office\" led by **COO Michael Fiddelke**. The confluence of economic uncertainty, trade policy impacts, and social issue blowback presents a complex challenge for **Target\\'s** leadership.\\n\\n## Tech & science developments\\n\\n<u>**Google Doubles Down on AI: New Tools Unveiled Amid Privacy and Monetization Questions**</u>\\n**Google\\'s** recent I/O event showcased a significant and widespread integration of Artificial Intelligence across its product ecosystem. The company unveiled new generative tools, including **Flow** for AI-powered video creation (integrating **Veo 3** and **Imagen 4** models with **Gemini AI**), and AI-driven enhancements to its core Search product, dubbed **AI Mode**.\\n\\nThe strategy is clear: embed AI seamlessly into users\\' daily interactions with **Google** services, from Search to Gmail and Docs. **CEO Sundar Pichai** emphasized AI as the future of technology. However, this aggressive push is accompanied by familiar concerns. Privacy advocates are scrutinizing new features like an AI shopping tool, despite **Google\\'s** assurances that uploaded user photos for this feature won\\'t be used for training or shared. *Furthermore, Google has begun testing the integration of ads directly into AI Mode search results in the US, raising questions about how it plans to monetize these powerful new AI capabilities and the potential impact on user experience.*\\n\\nThis AI offensive is also a response to intensifying competition, notably from **OpenAI**. **Google** is attempting to leverage its vast existing user base and product suite to deploy AI at scale. The partnership with Oscar-nominated director **Darren Aronofsky** for a generative-AI storytelling initiative signals ambitions beyond mere productivity tools. The central challenge for **Google** will be balancing innovation and market dominance with user trust, particularly concerning data privacy and the intrusiveness of its monetization strategies.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Computex 2025: AMD, Nvidia, and Handhelds Dominate Hardware Showcase**</u>\\n**Computex 2025** in **Taipei** has delivered a barrage of new computing hardware, with **AMD** and **Nvidia** unveiling next-generation silicon and the handheld PC market showing continued explosive growth. **AMD** took center stage with its **Threadripper 9000 series CPUs**, promising up to 22% better performance in threaded workloads, and the **Ryzen Z2 Extreme** chip, designed to power a new wave of handheld gaming devices.\\n\\nOne such device, the **MSI Claw A8**, garnered significant attention. Powered by the aforementioned **AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme**, **MSI** is emphasizing battery life while aiming for 60 frames-per-second gameplay. This reflects a broader trend, with **Lenovo** also active with its **Legion Go S** (reportedly with SteamOS) and upcoming **Legion Go 2**. **Nvidia** is not standing still, with its **RTX 5000 series GPUs** making their presence felt, following earlier launches of specific cards like the **RTX 5060**. *Intel is also competing, with its Core Ultra processors and Arc GPUs appearing in handhelds, alongside professional workstation cards like the Intel B60.*\\n\\nBeyond CPUs and GPUs, the show featured new motherboards like **ASUS\\'s ROG Crosshair x870E Hero BTF** and laptops such as **HP\\'s OmniBook 5 series**, which aims for a balance of affordability, design, and endurance. The overall theme is one of relentless performance improvement, increasing integration of AI capabilities at the hardware level, and the maturation of new form factors like handheld gaming PCs. Availability for many of these new components, including the **Threadripper 9000 series** and the **MSI Claw A8**, is anticipated for later in the year, primarily July and beyond.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Fortnite Back on Apple\\'s App Store After Contentious Legal Saga**</u>\\n**Fortnite**, the massively popular game from **Epic Games**, has made its return to the **Apple App Store** in the **US**. This marks a significant development in the protracted legal battle that began in 2020 when **Epic** attempted to bypass **Apple\\'s** in-app payment system and its associated commission fees, leading to **Fortnite\\'s** removal.\\n\\nThe journey back was arduous, involving multiple court rulings and appeals. While an initial 2021 ruling found **Apple** not in violation of antitrust laws, it did mandate that **Apple** allow developers to link to alternative payment options. **Apple\\'s** subsequent compliance attempts, which included imposing a 27% commission on such external payments, were deemed insufficient by **US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers**, who found **Apple** in civil contempt in **April 2025** for not adequately loosening its grip on the App Store. *It was under this judicial pressure that Apple ultimately reinstated the game.*\\n\\nThe fight is not entirely over. A hearing is scheduled for **May 27th** in **Oakland, California**, to further address **Apple\\'s** compliance with court orders regarding alternative payment systems. This case has been a bellwether for the broader power struggle between app developers and platform giants like **Apple** and **Google**, with significant implications for app store policies, commission structures, and developer freedoms globally. The return of **Fortnite** is a victory for **Epic**, but the final terms of engagement on **Apple\\'s** platform remain a contested issue.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Measles Alert: Shakira Concert at MetLife Stadium a Potential Exposure Site**</u>\\nHealth officials in **New Jersey** have issued a measles exposure warning following confirmation that an individual infected with the virus attended a **Shakira** concert at **MetLife Stadium** on the evening of **May 15th**. Thousands of concertgoers may have been exposed, raising concerns about a potential super-spreader event.\\n\\nThe **New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH)** issued the warning on **May 20th**, advising attendees to check their vaccination status and monitor for symptoms. *Individuals potentially exposed could develop symptoms as late as June 6th.* Measles is a highly contagious airborne virus that can lead to serious complications, particularly in unvaccinated children and immunocompromised individuals.\\n\\nThis warning arrives amidst a backdrop of rising measles cases nationally and declining vaccination rates, a concerning trend that threatens the **US\\'s** measles elimination status achieved in 2000. A significant outbreak is currently ongoing in **Texas**. The **NJDOH** and **CDC** emphasize that vaccination is the most effective preventive measure. This incident underscores the public health risks associated with large gatherings when vaccine-preventable diseases are circulating.\\n\\n## Noteworthy & under-reported\\n\\n<u>**Former Ukrainian Politician Andriy Portnov Gunned Down in Madrid**</u>\\n**Andriy Portnov**, a former Ukrainian politician who served as a senior aide to ousted **President Viktor Yanukovych**, was shot dead in **Madrid** on **May 21st**. The assassination reportedly occurred outside the **American School of Madrid**. **Portnov** fled **Ukraine** in 2014 following the Euromaidan revolution that toppled **Yanukovych**.\\n\\n**Portnov\\'s** career was controversial. He faced EU sanctions (later dropped) and a state treason investigation in **Ukraine** (closed in 2019). He returned to **Ukraine** briefly after **Volodymyr Zelenskyy\\'s** election in 2019 but was subsequently sanctioned by the **US Treasury Department** in 2021 for alleged corruption. He reportedly left **Ukraine** again after **Russia\\'s** full-scale invasion in 2022.\\n\\nSpanish authorities are investigating, with potential motives ranging from political retribution linked to the **Russia-Ukraine** conflict to disputes among criminal organizations. *Spain has unfortunately become a venue for several high-profile crimes involving Russian and Ukrainian nationals since 2022.* The killing of **Portnov**, while not a current major political player, adds another layer to the complex and often violent shadow activities connected to the ongoing war and its preceding political upheavals.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**EPA Budget Cuts Ignite Partisan Firestorm in Senate Hearing**</u>\\nA **Senate Environment and Public Works Committee** hearing on the **Trump administration\\'s** proposed budget cuts for the **Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)** descended into a heated partisan confrontation on **May 21st**. **EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin** faced a barrage of criticism from Democrats, while Republicans defended the cuts as essential for eliminating waste and fostering economic growth.\\n\\n**Democratic Senator Adam Schiff** went as far as accusing **Zeldin** of effectively \"causing cancer\" through deregulation and budget reductions that, he argued, would gut environmental protection efforts. **Senator Sheldon Whitehouse** challenged **Zeldin** on the EPA\\'s review process for grants awarded under the **Biden** administration, accusing the agency of making baseless fraud accusations and harassing career civil servants. **Zeldin** retorted sharply, accusing Democrats of fiscal irresponsibility and political grandstanding, asserting that he and his colleagues were \"busting their a--\" to identify and eliminate waste and abuse within the agency. *The proposed cuts would significantly reduce the EPA\\'s workforce and terminate billions in grants.*\\n\\nThe hearing starkly illustrated the deep ideological chasm over environmental policy and the EPA\\'s role. Democrats foresee dire public health and environmental consequences from a weakened EPA, while the **Trump** administration frames its approach as a necessary corrective to overreach and inefficiency, aiming to \"turbocharge\" the economy while ensuring clean air and water. The specifics of the grants under review and the true extent of any \"waste\" remain contentious points.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Jay Slater Inquest Adjourned Amid Mother\\'s Plea; Fan Clashes Mar Europa League Final Build-Up**</u>\\nThe inquest into the death of **Jay Slater**, a British teenager whose body was found in **Tenerife** in **July 2024** after he went missing in June, was adjourned on **May 21st**. The adjournment came after **Slater\\'s** mother, **Debbie Duncan**, pleaded for key witnesses to be compelled to testify. The inquest revealed that traces of cocaine, ecstasy, and ketamine were found in **Slater\\'s** system. Several friends who were with him in **Tenerife**, including **Lucy Law** (whom he called when lost) and individuals who rented the Airbnb where he was last seen, failed to appear.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in unrelated news with a UK interest, the **Europa League final** between **Manchester United** and **Tottenham Hotspur** is set to take place in **Bilbao, Spain**. The build-up has been marred by reports of fan misbehavior, including clashes between supporters of the two English clubs in **San Sebastian** and **Bilbao**. Tens of thousands of fans are descending on the city, with both teams vying for the trophy and a coveted Champions League spot. *Authorities in Bilbao are reportedly mounting a large security operation.*\\n\\nThe **Slater** inquest highlights the family\\'s ongoing search for answers and the difficulties in piecing together the final hours of his life, particularly with absent key witnesses. The Europa League final, while a significant sporting event, carries the unfortunate but familiar risk of fan disorder, requiring substantial policing efforts to manage.\\n</brief>\\n\\nCreate a title for the brief.

The financial fallout is stark: an estimated **£300 million** hit to trading profits. Beyond the balance sheet, customer personal data was compromised, including potential exposure of names, addresses, and birth dates. Online operations suffered considerable disruption, with website downtime and order suspensions.\\n\\nThe retailer anticipates these operational headaches will persist into **July** as system restoration continues. This incident isn\\'t just a technical or financial problem; it\\'s a direct hit to customer trust and operational stability. **M&S CEO Stuart Machin** has framed it as a \"bump in the road\" and an opportunity to accelerate technology transformation, a brave face on a costly reality. The **Information Commissioner\\'s Office (ICO)** looms in the background, with a potential investigation and fine adding to M&S\\'s woes. *The attack involved the deployment of DragonForce ransomware to VMware ESXi hosts in late April, following an initial suspected breach by Scattered Spider around February 2025.*\\n\\nThis attack underscores the persistent and evolving threat ransomware poses to major corporations, particularly in the retail sector. **Scattered Spider** is not an unknown entity, having reportedly targeted other UK retailers like **Co-op** and **Harrods**. The key questions now revolve around the specifics of the \"human error\" M&S alluded to, whether a ransom was paid, and the long-term impact on brand loyalty. The incident serves as a costly reminder that cybersecurity underinvestment, or even a momentary lapse, can have cascading and severe consequences.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**UK Inflation Jumps to 3.5%, Squeezing Households and Forcing BoE\\'s Hand**</u>\\nThe United Kingdom\\'s inflation rate unexpectedly surged to **3.5%** in **April 2025**, marking its highest level in over a year. This unwelcome development, primarily driven by rising energy and water bills, has intensified the ongoing cost of living crisis and thrown a wrench into the **Bank of England\\'s** interest rate strategy. Economists had anticipated an increase, but the actual figure overshot forecasts, pushing inflation further from the Bank\\'s **2% target**.\\n\\nThe political ramifications were immediate. **Chancellor Rachel Reeves (Labour)** expressed disappointment, acknowledging the pressure on working people, while **Shadow Chancellor Mel Stride (Conservative)** laid the blame squarely on **Labour\\'s** economic mismanagement. This rise complicates the **Bank of England\\'s** path; after four rate cuts between August 2024 and May 2025 brought rates to 4.25%, further easing now looks less certain. *The Bank projects inflation to peak at 3.7% between July and September 2025, only returning to its 2% target in early 2027.*\\n\\nThis inflationary spike isn\\'t occurring in a vacuum. It follows a period where inflation had fallen close to target in mid-2024, after peaking above 11% in late 2022 post-Ukraine invasion. The current government, led by **Prime Minister Keir Starmer**, now faces heightened scrutiny over its economic stewardship. The debate over causes is also telling: some point to the timing of Easter, others to rises in National Insurance Contributions for employers and a higher minimum wage. Regardless of the precise drivers, the reality for households is continued financial strain, and for policymakers, a difficult balancing act between curbing inflation and supporting a fragile recovery.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**FDA Tightens COVID Vaccine Access, Moderna Pulls Combo Shot Application**</u>\\nThe **US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)** is significantly altering its approach to COVID-19 vaccines, now requiring new clinical trials for healthy individuals under 65 before approving annual boosters. Updates for high-risk groups, including seniors, will continue under the existing framework. This policy shift coincides with **Moderna\\'s** decision to withdraw its application for a combined flu-COVID shot, following discussions with the agency.\\n\\nThis recalibration appears influenced by new leadership at the **Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)**, now headed by **Robert F. Kennedy Jr.**, and at the **FDA** itself, with **Dr. Martin Makary** as Commissioner and **Dr. Vinay Prasad** heading the vaccine division. The stated rationale centers on concerns about vaccine efficacy for lower-risk populations and the need for more robust, placebo-controlled trial data. *Previously, annual COVID shots were recommended for nearly everyone aged 6 months and older.* The FDA is still due to decide on **Moderna’s** next-generation COVID-19 vaccine by late May.\\n\\nThe move signals a departure from the \"one-size-fits-all\" regulatory approach adopted during the pandemic\\'s peak. **Pfizer** has stated it stands by the science behind its vaccine and the benefits of broad vaccination programs. The FDA\\'s new stance, however, suggests a pivot towards a more risk-stratified approval process, aligning somewhat with policies already in place in some other developed nations. This will undoubtedly impact vaccine manufacturers\\' strategies and public uptake, while also fueling the ongoing debate about vaccine mandates and long-term COVID management.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Record Floods Batter New South Wales, Australia: Fatalities and Mass Rescues**</u>\\n**New South Wales, Australia**, is reeling from record-breaking floods that have devastated its **Hunter** and **Mid North Coast** regions. Described as a \"one-in-500-year flood,\" the event has resulted in at least two confirmed fatalities, including **63-year-old David Knowles** found in **Coopernook**, and a **25-year-old male** near **Wauchope**. The **NSW State Emergency Service (SES)** has conducted hundreds of flood rescues, airlifting residents from rooftops as thousands remain isolated.\\n\\nThe **Manning River** at **Taree** surpassed its 1929 record, reaching **6.37 meters**, indicative of the deluge\\'s severity. Both state and federal governments, led by **NSW Premier Chris Minns** and **Federal Emergency Management Minister Kristy McBain** respectively, have declared the affected areas natural disaster zones, activating relief assistance. *Heavy rainfall is ongoing, with warnings of further flooding, exacerbating an already dire situation where some areas were saturated from previous events like Cyclone Alfred in March.*\\n\\nThis disaster highlights the acute vulnerability of communities to extreme weather. While emergency services are stretched, the focus is shifting towards the long-term impact on infrastructure, livelihoods, and the psychological toll on affected residents. The scale of this event will inevitably lead to questions about climate change adaptation, infrastructure resilience, and disaster preparedness in flood-prone regions.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**School Bus Bombed in Balochistan, Pakistan; Islamabad Points Finger at India**</u>\\nA suicide car bombing targeting a school bus in **Khuzdar, Balochistan, Pakistan**, has killed at least four children and several adults, with dozens more injured. The bus was en route to a military-run school. In a swift and direct accusation, **Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif** blamed **India** for the attack, alleging Indian support for terrorists operating in the restive province. **India** has denied these claims.\\n\\nNo group immediately claimed responsibility for the **May 21st** bombing. However, Balochistan has a long-running separatist insurgency, with groups like the **Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA)** frequently targeting state symbols and security forces. *This attack follows a BLA attack on a train in March 2025 that killed 33, mostly soldiers, and occurs despite a fragile ceasefire agreed between India and Pakistan in Kashmir earlier in May.*\\n\\nThe targeting of a school bus carrying children is a grim escalation, regardless of the perpetrator. **Sharif\\'s** immediate accusation against **India** significantly raises regional tensions, already high due to the Kashmir dispute and historical mistrust. The incident will likely fuel further instability in **Balochistan**, a strategically important province due to its mineral resources and the **China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)**. The key questions now are whether any group will claim responsibility and if **Pakistan** will present credible evidence for its accusations against **India**, or if this will become another point of bitter contention between the nuclear-armed neighbors.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Russian GRU Hackers Target Ukraine Aid Logistics in Sustained Cyber Campaign**</u>\\nA persistent cyber campaign orchestrated by **Russian GRU Unit 26165**, also known as **Fancy Bear** or **Forest Blizzard**, has been targeting logistics and technology firms involved in delivering aid to **Ukraine** since early 2022. The attacks employ methods such as credential guessing, spear-phishing, and exploiting vulnerabilities, with the clear aim of disrupting assistance flows and gathering intelligence.\\n\\nThe **UK\\'s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)**, alongside allies including the **US, Germany, and France**, issued a joint advisory on **May 21st** to expose this malicious activity and urge organizations to bolster their defenses. Targets have reportedly included air traffic control, airports, defense contractors, IT service providers, maritime operations, and even internet-connected cameras at Ukrainian border crossings to track aid shipments. *This campaign expanded significantly around the time of Russia\\'s full-scale invasion in February 2022.*\\n\\nThis is not merely opportunistic hacking; it\\'s a state-sponsored effort integral to **Russia\\'s** broader war strategy against **Ukraine**. By targeting the logistical backbone of international aid, **Moscow** seeks to undermine **Ukraine\\'s** resilience and defense capabilities. The joint advisory signals a coordinated Western response to this cyber front, but the challenge remains for numerous, often smaller, entities in the supply chain to implement robust security against a sophisticated and determined adversary like **GRU Unit 26165**. The full extent of the damage and the specific vulnerabilities exploited remain key information gaps.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**DOJ Probes Former NY Governor Cuomo\\'s COVID Testimony**</u>\\nThe **US Department of Justice (DOJ)** has initiated a criminal investigation into former **New York Governor Andrew Cuomo** concerning his testimony to Congress regarding his administration\\'s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically related to nursing home deaths. This probe follows a referral from House Republicans who allege **Cuomo** lied to the **House Oversight Committee**.\\n\\n**Cuomo**, who resigned in August 2021 amid sexual harassment allegations and is now running for **New York City mayor**, has, through his spokesperson **Rich Azzopardi**, decried the investigation as politically motivated election interference. *The controversy dates back to a 2020 directive requiring nursing homes to accept recovering COVID-19 patients and subsequent allegations that Cuomo\\'s administration underreported related deaths.* The investigation is reportedly being overseen by **Jeanine Pirro**, the new head of the U.S. attorney\\'s office in Washington, who has a past political rivalry with **Cuomo**.\\n\\nThis investigation re-ignites a painful chapter of the pandemic and thrusts **Cuomo\\'s** controversial tenure back into the spotlight, just as he attempts a political comeback. The timing, coinciding with his mayoral run and the recent dropping of a corruption case against current **NYC Mayor Eric Adams**, will inevitably fuel accusations of political weaponization of the **DOJ**. The core of the investigation will likely scrutinize discrepancies between **Cuomo\\'s** testimony and evidence regarding his office\\'s involvement in drafting a state report on nursing home deaths.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Trump Administration\\'s Deportation and Police Reform Reversals Face Court Scrutiny**</u>\\nThe **Trump administration** is encountering significant legal headwinds over its aggressive deportation policies and a rollback of **Biden-era** police reforms. A federal judge, **Brian Murphy**, has accused the administration of violating due process and potentially being in contempt of court for deporting migrants to **South Sudan** despite a court order mandating they have a chance to challenge such removals to third countries. *The deportation flight proceeded on May 21st, prompting an emergency hearing where Judge Murphy admonished the administration.*\\n\\nSimultaneously, the **Department of Justice (DOJ)**, under **Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon**, is moving to dismiss lawsuits and end investigations into police departments in cities like **Minneapolis** and **Louisville**, which were initiated following high-profile incidents like the death of **George Floyd**. The **DOJ** is also retracting previous findings of constitutional violations. This reversal is drawing sharp criticism from civil rights advocates, who warn it will undermine police accountability. **Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem** has defended the deportations, citing the criminal records of some migrants.\\n\\nThese actions signal a sharp divergence from the previous administration\\'s approach to both immigration and police oversight. The legal challenge to deportations highlights a fundamental tension between executive authority and judicial review, particularly concerning due process for migrants. The dismantling of police consent decrees and investigations represents a significant policy shift, prioritizing local control over federal oversight, a move critics argue will reverse progress made on police accountability and racial justice. The administration\\'s claim of compliance with court orders in the deportation case is directly contested by the presiding judge, setting the stage for further legal battles.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Biden\\'s Post-Presidency Health Diagnosis and Cognitive Decline Allegations Ignite Political Firestorm**</u>\\nFormer President **Joe Biden\\'s** recent prostate cancer diagnosis and persistent allegations of cognitive decline during his presidency have erupted into a significant political controversy. Claims are surfacing, notably in a new book, \\'Original Sin\\' by **Jake Tapper** and **Alex Thompson**, that there was an effort to cover up the extent of **Biden\\'s** condition while he was in office. This has led to accusations of elder abuse and even calls for scrutiny of **Jill Biden\\'s** role.\\n\\n**President Trump** has publicly questioned the timing of the cancer diagnosis, suggesting it should have been revealed earlier, and has accused **Biden\\'s** former staff of manipulating him. *Biden withdrew from the 2024 presidential race in July 2024, citing cognitive concerns, with Kamala Harris then becoming the Democratic nominee.* The book reportedly details incidents such as an attempted filming of a fake town hall in spring 2024 that was unusable due to **Biden\\'s** incoherence. **Biden** himself has rejected notions of significant cognitive decline.\\n\\nThis situation is politically charged, with the reliability of various claims heavily influenced by partisan leanings. The core issue, however, is the health and capacity of a recent president and the transparency surrounding it. The allegations, if substantiated, raise serious questions about the decision-making processes within the **Biden White House** and the ethical responsibilities of those around him. The controversy also provides ample ammunition for political opponents and fuels ongoing debates about age and fitness for office.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**EU & UK Slap New Sanctions on Russian Oil; US Hesitates, Prioritizing Putin Talks**</u>\\nThe **European Union** and the **United Kingdom** have jointly announced a new wave of sanctions targeting **Russia\\'s** oil exports, specifically its \\'shadow fleet\\' of tankers used to circumvent existing restrictions. This move aims to further pressure **Moscow** over its continued aggression in **Ukraine**. However, this coordinated European action contrasts with a more hesitant stance from **Washington**, where **President Trump** is reportedly reluctant to impose further sanctions, prioritizing potential negotiations with **Russian President Vladimir Putin**.\\n\\nThis divergence became apparent following a two-hour phone call between **Trump** and **Putin** on **May 20th**, which yielded no breakthrough on a ceasefire. **Trump** also spoke with **Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy**. *The EU\\'s Ursula von der Leyen stressed the need to intensify pressure, while Trump fears new sanctions could hinder mediation efforts.* Meanwhile, fighting persists in eastern **Ukraine**, and cross-border attacks, including a Ukrainian drone strike on a semiconductor plant in **Russia\\'s Oryol region**, continue. **Putin** subsequently visited the **Kursk** region, previously site of a Ukrainian incursion.\\n\\nThe differing approaches on sanctions highlight a potential fracture in Western unity against **Russia**. While the **EU** and **UK** are doubling down on economic pressure, the **US** under **Trump** appears to be exploring a more direct diplomatic track with **Putin**, even suggesting a future restart of trade with **Russia** post-conflict. This could embolden **Putin** and complicate **Ukraine\\'s** position. The G7 finance ministers are currently meeting in **Canada**, where these trade tensions and disagreements over Russia policy will undoubtedly be a contentious topic.\\n\\n## United Kingdom focus\\n\\n<u>**UK Government Reverses Course on Winter Fuel Payment Cuts After Backlash**</u>\\nThe **Labour** government, under **Prime Minister Keir Starmer**, has executed a significant U-turn, reversing its earlier decision to cut winter fuel payments for pensioners. The initial policy, which restricted eligibility to those on means-tested benefits and was championed by **Chancellor Rachel Reeves** as a cost-saving measure, provoked considerable political backlash and was blamed for **Labour\\'s** poor showing in recent local elections.\\n\\n**Starmer** signaled the policy shift during Prime Minister\\'s Questions, linking the reversal to purported improvements in the UK economy. The government now intends to widen eligibility for the payments, with specifics to be unveiled in the autumn budget. *The original cuts, announced around July 2024, were projected to save the Treasury between £1.3 billion and £1.5 billion annually.* This reversal follows concerns voiced by **Labour** MPs, some of whom threatened a rebellion.\\n\\nThis episode highlights the acute tension between fiscal consolidation and political reality, especially amidst a persistent cost of living crisis. While **Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall** has been advocating for broader welfare reforms, the unpopularity of the winter fuel cuts proved too potent. The U-turn may appease some critics but raises questions about the government\\'s decisiveness and the coherence of its broader welfare agenda. Opponents, like **Tory Leader Kemi Badenoch** and **Lib Dem Leader Ed Davey**, have seized on the reversal as evidence of a government in disarray.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Fatal Blaze at Bicester Motion Claims Lives of Two Firefighters, One Civilian**</u>\\nA tragic fire at **Bicester Motion**, a former RAF base in **Oxfordshire**, has resulted in the deaths of two firefighters, **Martyn Sadler** and **Jennie Logan**, and a member of the public, **David Chester**. Tributes have been paid to all three, particularly highlighting the bravery of the firefighters and **Mr. Chester\\'s** selfless actions in assisting them.\\n\\nThe fire, which broke out around **May 16th**, also left two other firefighters with serious injuries; they have since been reported by **Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service** as conscious and in stable condition. **Thames Valley Police** are investigating the cause of the blaze, which is currently being treated as unexplained, though a criminal investigation has been ruled out for now. *The area was declared safe on May 20th after the fire was brought under control.*\\n\\nThis incident is a stark reminder of the dangers faced by emergency service personnel. The loss of life has deeply affected the local community and the firefighting fraternity. The ongoing investigation will be crucial in determining the fire\\'s origin and any factors that may have contributed to the tragic outcome, with hopes that lessons learned can prevent similar incidents in the future.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Tragedy in the Channel: Migrant Deaths Underscore Perilous Crossings**</u>\\nThe English Channel has claimed more lives, with a woman and a child dying in an attempt to cross from **France** to **Britain** in a small boat on **May 21st**. This brings the death toll for the week to at least three, and for the year to at least fourteen. French rescue services discovered the two unconscious individuals aboard a vessel carrying nearly 80 migrants off the **Pas de Calais** coast.\\n\\nDespite the evident dangers, the crossings persist. Over **12,748** individuals have made the journey so far this year. In this latest incident, a French Navy vessel rescued 10 people, while the remaining migrants continued towards the UK. *Earlier in the week, another migrant died and one was reported missing when their boat broke apart.*\\n\\nThese recurring tragedies fuel the contentious debate over how to manage irregular migration. Charities like **Safe Passage International** reiterate calls for safer, legal routes for asylum seekers, arguing these deaths are preventable. However, governments on both sides of the Channel face political pressure to curb the crossings, often focusing on deterrence and enforcement. The grim reality is that as long as desperate individuals see no viable alternative, such perilous attempts, and the attendant human cost, are likely to continue.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**UK Weather Whiplash: From Driest Spring to Tornado Warnings**</u>\\nThe **United Kingdom** is experiencing a dramatic meteorological shift, transitioning from one of its driest springs in decades to a period of highly unsettled weather, including a tornado warning issued by the **Met Office** for parts of southern **England** on **May 21st**. The warning encompassed potential thunder, lightning, hail, and the rare threat of tornadoes.\\n\\nThis turbulent weather follows an unusually arid start to spring, which saw nearly 20mm less rain by mid-May than the record low for a full spring season set in 1852. This prolonged dry spell has prompted the **Environment Agency** to warn of potential drought conditions this summer, with possible water restrictions for millions if sustained rainfall doesn\\'t materialize. *The severity of the current conditions was underscored by a house fire in Fittleworth, West Sussex, attributed to a lightning strike.*\\n\\nWhile drier weather is anticipated for **May 22nd**, with more settled conditions by **May 23rd**, the forecast predicts a return to wet and windy weather for the upcoming Bank Holiday weekend. This volatility highlights the increasing unpredictability of weather patterns, posing challenges for agriculture, water resource management, and public safety.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Birmingham Bin Strike Drags On: Union Accuses Council, Commissioners of Sabotage**</u>\\nNegotiations to resolve the protracted bin strike in **Birmingham** have hit an impasse, with the **Unite** union accusing government-appointed commissioners and the **Labour-led city council** of deliberately sabotaging talks by blocking a revised pay offer. The union contends that its members are facing potential pay cuts of up to **£8,000** due to job downgrades.\\n\\nThe strike, which escalated to an all-out action on **March 11th**, has left rubbish piling up on city streets. **Birmingham City Council**, which effectively declared bankruptcy in September 2023 and is now under commissioner oversight, denies obstructing a deal and urges **Unite** to suspend the strike. *Talks facilitated by the conciliation service Acas began around May 1st, with Unite claiming a \\'ballpark\\' deal discussed on May 6th was never formalized in writing by the council.*\\n\\nThis dispute places **Birmingham\\'s Labour** leadership, and by extension the national party, in an uncomfortable position regarding its commitment to workers\\' rights. **Unite General Secretary Sharon Graham** has been vocal in her criticism, accusing the council and government of betrayal. The council maintains it is committed to ending the dispute but must act within financial and legal constraints, especially given past governance failures. For **Birmingham** residents, the standoff means continued disruption and public health concerns.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Tommy Robinson Faces New Harassment Charges Following Prison Release**</u>\\n**Tommy Robinson (Stephen Yaxley-Lennon)** has been charged with harassment causing fear of violence against two men, with a court appearance set for **Westminster Magistrates\\' Court** on **June 5, 2025**. This development comes shortly after **Robinson\\'s** sentence for contempt of court – related to breaching an injunction in a libel case involving a Syrian refugee – was reduced, leading to his earlier release from prison.\\n\\nThe new harassment charges stem from an alleged incident in **August 2024**. **Robinson** was previously jailed for 18 months in **October 2024** for contempt after repeatedly making false allegations against the refugee, despite an injunction. *His sentence was recently cut by four months due to what his lawyers argued was a \\'change in attitude\\' and steps taken to comply with the injunction.* He also faces a separate trial, anticipated in **October 2025**, for failing to provide the PIN for his mobile phone when stopped by **Kent Police** in **July 2024**.\\n\\nThese fresh charges ensure **Robinson** remains entangled with the legal system. The pattern of legal troubles underscores the contentious nature of his activism and its consequences. The upcoming court appearances will be closely watched, particularly in the context of debates around free speech, harassment, and the enforcement of court orders.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Labour\\'s Internal Rifts Exposed: Rayner Pushes for Tax Hikes, Clashing with Reeves**</u>\\nInternal policy tensions within the **Labour** government have been laid bare by a leaked memo revealing a significant disagreement between **Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner** and **Chancellor Rachel Reeves** over tax policy. **Rayner** reportedly advocated for tax increases on pensions, inheritance, and banks in a memo sent to **Reeves** prior to the Spring Statement, proposals that were ultimately not adopted.\\n\\nThis division emerges at a sensitive time for **Prime Minister Keir Starmer\\'s** government, which is grappling with rising inflation and considering U-turns on unpopular spending cuts, such as those to the winter fuel allowance. **Tory leader Kemi Badenoch** seized upon the leaked memo during Prime Minister\\'s Questions, highlighting the internal discord and questioning **Starmer\\'s** control over his cabinet. *Reports also suggest potential rebellion among Labour MPs over proposed cuts to sickness and disability benefits.*\\n\\nWhile government sources attempt to downplay the divisions, with **Environment Secretary Steve Reed** claiming cabinet unity on tax and spend, the leak suggests a genuine policy schism. **Rayner\\'s** push for higher taxes, framed as \"popular, prudent and would not raise taxes on working people,\" contrasts with the government\\'s current fiscal stance. This could signal deeper ideological differences within **Labour\\'s** senior ranks and potentially fuel speculation about **Rayner\\'s** own leadership ambitions, adding another layer of complexity to **Starmer\\'s** challenges.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**BBC Parts Ways with Gary Lineker After Anti-Semitism Row Over \\'Rat Emoji\\' Post**</u>\\n**Gary Lineker**, the prominent football presenter, has left the **BBC** following a controversy sparked by a social media post in which he used a rat emoji in reference to Zionism. The post drew widespread accusations of anti-Semitism. **Lineker** subsequently issued an \"unreserved apology,\" stating he was unaware of the offensive connotations of the symbol.\\n\\nThe **BBC** has acted decisively, dropping **Lineker\\'s** popular podcast \\'The Rest is Football\\' from BBC Sounds. He will also no longer present \\'Match of the Day,\\' nor will he front the corporation\\'s coverage of the World Cup 2026 or the FA Cup. *His final appearance on Match of the Day is scheduled for May 25th.* The **Metropolitan Police** are reportedly assessing the social media post.\\n\\nThe incident has ignited a fierce debate about anti-Semitism, freedom of speech, and the responsibilities of high-profile **BBC** personalities. Figures like **Danny Cohen**, former **BBC** Director of Television, criticized the corporation\\'s handling of the situation, while **Andrew Gilbert** of the Board of Deputies of British Jews called for mandatory anti-Semitism training for all **BBC** staff. This marks a tumultuous end to **Lineker\\'s** long tenure at the **BBC**, highlighting the sensitivities and potential pitfalls of social media engagement for public figures.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Chris Brown Granted £5 Million Bail in UK Assault Case**</u>\\nAmerican R&B artist **Chris Brown** has been released on **£5 million bail** by **Southwark Crown Court** in **London** after being arrested on charges of grievous bodily harm with intent. The charges stem from an alleged assault on music producer **Abraham Diaw** at the **Tape nightclub** in **Mayfair** in **February 2023**. **Brown\\'s** co-defendant, **Omololu Akinlolu (Hoody Baby)**, faces similar charges.\\n\\n**Brown** was arrested in **Manchester** upon his arrival in the UK around **May 15th**. Under the strict bail conditions, he has surrendered his passport but is permitted to continue his world tour, which is scheduled to begin in **Amsterdam** on **June 8th**. He must reside at a specified UK address when not touring and is required to return for his next court appearance, a plea hearing, on **June 20th**. *The Crown Prosecution Service authorized the charge, emphasizing Brown\\'s right to a fair trial.*\\n\\nThis case adds another chapter to **Brown\\'s** history of legal troubles. The seriousness of the grievous bodily harm charge in the UK means he could face significant penalties if convicted. The high bail figure reflects the severity and the potential flight risk, although his legal team successfully argued for his release to allow him to fulfill his tour commitments. The outcome of the June hearing will be critical in determining the next steps in this transatlantic legal drama.\\n\\n## Global landscape\\n\\n<u>**Syria Teeters on Renewed Conflict as Sanctions Lift, Al-Sharaa\\'s Grip Tested**</u>\\n**Syria** is in a precarious state, with the spectre of renewed civil war looming despite the recent lifting of sanctions by the **US** and **EU**. **US Secretary of State Marco Rubio** has warned of a potential collapse of the transitional government led by **Ahmed al-Sharaa** (formerly **Abu Mohammad al-Julani**, leader of **Hayat Tahrir al-Sham**) and a resurgence of **ISIS**.\\n\\nThe sanctions relief, initiated after **al-Sharaa\\'s HTS-led rebel offensive ousted President Bashar al-Assad** in late 2024, was intended to stabilize the country and encourage the return of displaced Syrians. **President Trump** met with **al-Sharaa** in **Saudi Arabia** in **May 2025**, signaling a significant policy shift. However, **al-Sharaa\\'s** past as a jihadist leader and recent violence in Alawite-minority and Druze areas raise serious concerns about his commitment to inclusivity and stability. *UN Special Envoy Geir Pedersen noted cautious optimism among Syrians but also highlighted \"real dangers of renewed conflict.\"*\\n\\nThe international community is walking a tightrope. Supporting **al-Sharaa** is seen by some, including **Rubio**, as a necessary evil to prevent a wider regional conflagration and the re-emergence of **ISIS** in ungoverned spaces. Critics, however, point to **HTS\\'s** extremist roots and question the viability of a stable **Syria** under its leadership. The coming weeks will be critical in determining whether the lifting of sanctions will indeed pave the way for aid and stability or if **Syria** will descend back into widespread conflict.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Gaza and South Africa: Twin Pressure Points for International Diplomacy**</u>\\nInternational tensions are flaring on two distinct but increasingly interlinked fronts: **Israel\\'s** actions in **Gaza** and the **US** relationship with **South Africa**. **Israel** faces mounting pressure over its military offensive and restrictions on humanitarian aid in **Gaza**, leading to the **UK** suspending free trade talks and sanctioning West Bank settlers. An incident on **May 21st**, where **EU, Arab, and Asian diplomats reportedly came under Israeli fire in Jenin, West Bank**, has further inflamed the situation. **Pope Leo XIV** has added his voice to calls for aid to enter **Gaza**, where anti-Hamas protests have also been reported.\\n\\nSimultaneously, **US-South Africa** relations are strained. **President Trump** recently hosted **South African President Cyril Ramaphosa** at the White House, where **Trump** controversially showed a video alleging \\'genocide\\' against white farmers in **South Africa** and reiterated his decision to cut US financial aid to the country over alleged \\'unjust racial discrimination\\'. This follows **South Africa\\'s** signing of an Expropriation Bill and its vocal criticism of **Israel**, including filing a case at the **ICJ**. *Ramaphosa, accompanied by golfers Ernie Els and Retief Goosen, sought to reset relations, denying any \\'genocide\\' and defending the land expropriation law as a measure to address historical inequalities.*\\n\\nThese developments create a complex diplomatic web. The **UK\\'s** move against **Israel** signals growing impatience among Western allies. **Trump\\'s** focus on the white farmer issue in **South Africa**, a claim widely disputed and labeled as disproven, injects a volatile element into relations with a key African nation. **South Africa\\'s** own stance on **Israel** further complicates its international standing. The convergence of these issues highlights deep divisions on human rights, international law, and the handling of protracted conflicts.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**India Ramps Up Anti-Maoist Campaign, Claims Killing of Top Rebel Leader**</u>\\nIndian security forces have significantly intensified their operations against Maoist rebels, particularly in the state of **Chhattisgarh**. Authorities claim a major success with the killing of **Nambala Keshav Rao (also known as Basavaraju)**, described as the \"topmost leader\" of the **Communist Party of India-Maoist**, along with at least 26 other fighters in an operation on **May 21st**. This comes as **Home Minister Amit Shah** reiterated the government\\'s goal of eliminating the decades-long insurgency by **March 2026**.\\n\\nThe government under **Prime Minister Narendra Modi** has lauded these successes, with **Shah** recently announcing the killing of 31 fighters in a separate operation. *Since last year, security forces claim to have killed at least 400 rebels.* However, this intensified campaign is not without controversy. Human rights activists, such as lawyer **Bela Bhatia**, have voiced serious concerns about the potential for civilian casualties and extrajudicial killings, questioning whether some of those killed had surrendered.\\n\\nThe conflict is deeply rooted in issues of land rights, resource exploitation in mineral-rich tribal (Adivasi) areas, and historical grievances. While the government frames its actions as essential for security and development, critics argue that development initiatives are often geared towards resource extraction, further alienating Adivasi populations. The Maoists, in turn, claim they are open to unconditional dialogue but see the ongoing killings as undermining any peace process. The death of a figure like **Basavaraju** is a blow to the Maoists, but the underlying socio-economic issues fueling the insurgency remain largely unaddressed.\\n\\n## Superpower monitor\\n\\n<u>**US-China Tech War Heats Up: Chip Controls, EV Battery Race Intensify Rivalry**</u>\\nThe technological and trade rivalry between the **United States** and **China** is escalating, marked by stringent **US** export controls on advanced semiconductor chips and a fierce competition for dominance in the electric vehicle (EV) battery market. **Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang** recently asserted that **US** chip export controls, aimed at hindering **China\\'s** AI development, have backfired by spurring Chinese companies like **Huawei** to accelerate their own domestic innovation.\\n\\n**Washington\\'s** strategy, initiated under the **Biden** administration and now being reshaped by **President Trump**, aims to regulate the global diffusion of AI and block **China** from accessing top-tier chip technology. The **Trump** administration plans to rescind some **Biden-era** curbs but replace them with its own restrictions. Meanwhile, the EV battery sector is a key battleground. **China** is showcasing rapid advancements, with companies like **BYD** and **CATL** (which plans US factories) pushing boundaries in battery technology and charging speeds. The **US**, in response, is focusing on cost reduction and alternative chemistries, exemplified by **General Motors\\'** partnership with **LG Energy Solutions** for a cheaper long-range battery. *Chinese firm Gotion Inc. is also building battery plants in the US, a move Trump has publicly welcomed if it means American jobs.*\\n\\nThis multifaceted competition extends to tariff policies and investment restrictions, with recent intense negotiations in **Geneva** over tariffs. **China** has criticized **US** chip curbs as undermining these talks and has threatened to invoke its anti-foreign sanctions law. The **EU** is also entering the fray, announcing a flat fee on small parcels imported from **China**. The core tension remains: the **US** seeks to maintain its technological edge and national security, while **China** strives for self-reliance and global leadership in key future industries. **Huang\\'s** comments suggest that decoupling, even if partially successful, comes with the unintended consequence of fostering indigenous Chinese capabilities.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Trump\\'s \\'Big, Beautiful Bill\\' Hits Headwinds: GOP Infighting Stalls Tax and Spending Package**</u>\\nHouse Republicans are encountering significant internal friction in their efforts to pass **President Trump\\'s** signature legislative item, dubbed the \\'big, beautiful bill\\' – a comprehensive package of tax cuts and spending adjustments. The primary obstacle is not Democratic opposition, which is unified against the bill, but deep divisions within the **Republican** ranks, particularly between moderate and conservative factions.\\n\\nKey sticking points include the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction cap and proposed reforms to Medicaid. The **House Freedom Caucus** is pushing for more aggressive changes to Medicaid, including faster implementation of work requirements, and a quicker phase-out or repeal of clean energy tax credits. Moderates, particularly from high-tax states, are concerned about the SALT cap. *The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis, indicating the bill would disproportionately benefit the wealthy while potentially harming low-income households through Medicaid changes, has further fueled Democratic criticism and complicated Republican messaging.*\\n\\n**House Speaker Mike Johnson** and White House negotiators are scrambling to broker a compromise to appease these warring factions ahead of a Memorial Day deadline. **President Trump** himself met with House Republicans to urge support. Changes unveiled on **May 22nd** included adjustments to the SALT deduction and Medicaid work requirements. The bill also includes a provision to raise the debt ceiling, adding another layer of urgency. This legislative battle underscores the challenges of governing with a narrow majority and the ideological rifts within the **Republican Party**, even with a president of their own party pushing hard for passage.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Trump Unveils \\'Golden Dome\\' Missile Defense Amid Cost and Geopolitical Concerns**</u>\\n**President Trump** has announced ambitious plans for a **$175 billion \\'Golden Dome\\'** missile defense system, designed to shield the **United States** from a range of threats including hypersonic, ballistic, and cruise missiles, potentially even those launched from space. The project is to be overseen by **General Michael Guetlein**, Vice Chief of Space Operations.\\n\\nHowever, the initiative is already mired in controversy. Cost estimates vary wildly, with the **Congressional Budget Office (CBO)** reportedly projecting a potential cost of **$524-542 billion** over 20 years, far exceeding the administration\\'s initial figure and three-year completion timeline. Congress has allocated an initial **$25 billion**. Concerns about potential conflicts of interest have also surfaced, particularly regarding **Elon Musk\\'s SpaceX** as a potential prime contractor, possibly in partnership with firms like **Palantir** and **Anduril**. *Forty-two Democratic lawmakers have requested a review of the Pentagon\\'s procurement process, citing these concerns and questioning a \"subscription service\" model proposed by SpaceX.*\\n\\nInternationally, both **Russia** and **China** have voiced strong opposition, deeming the \\'Golden Dome\\' concept \"deeply destabilizing\" and warning it could turn outer space into an arena for armed confrontation. The project evokes memories of **Reagan\\'s \\'Star Wars\\' (SDI)** program and signals a significant investment in next-generation defense technologies across land, sea, and space. The administration\\'s push for rapid development before the end of **Trump\\'s** term in 2029 adds pressure to an already complex and costly undertaking.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**US Greenlights Qatari Jet for Air Force One Fleet, Sparking Ethics Debate**</u>\\nThe **United States** government has officially accepted a **Boeing 747-8** aircraft as a gift from **Qatar**, intended for use as part of the **Air Force One** presidential fleet. This unconventional acquisition has immediately ignited a firestorm of ethical and constitutional concerns.\\n\\nCritics, including **Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth**, highlight the substantial taxpayer burden, estimating that retrofitting the **$400 million** jet to meet the stringent security and communication standards required for **Air Force One** could cost up to **$1 billion**. This raises questions about potential violations of the **Emoluments Clause** of the US Constitution, which prohibits gifts to public officials from foreign governments without Congressional approval. *The Trump administration, via White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt and Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell, defends the acceptance as a transparent, government-to-government transaction that will ultimately save costs, as the plane is being given to the US Defense Department, not Trump personally.* **Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani** echoed this, stating it\\'s a deal between defense ministries.\\n\\n**Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth** has directed the **US Air Force**, under **Secretary Troy Meink**, to begin planning the modifications. This Qatari jet is intended to supplement the existing, aging **Air Force One** planes and potentially bridge a gap caused by delays in **Boeing\\'s** delivery of two new, purpose-built 747-8s. Despite the administration\\'s defense, the optics of accepting such a high-value gift from a foreign nation, especially one with significant interests in US foreign policy, will continue to fuel debate about influence and propriety.\\n\\n## Economic currents\\n\\n<u>**Target\\'s Sales Stumble: Tariffs, DEI Backlash Cited for Lowered Forecast**</u>\\n**Target\\'s** financial performance has hit a snag, with first-quarter sales in 2025 falling short of expectations, prompting the retail giant to lower its full-year forecast. The company reported a **2.8%** drop in sales to **$23.85 billion** for the quarter ending **May 3rd**, and now anticipates a low-single-digit decline for the full year. Comparable store sales fell **3.8%**, with a **5.7%** drop in physical store sales slightly offset by a **4.7%** increase in online business.\\n\\n**CEO Brian Cornell** attributed the downturn to a \"challenging\" economic environment, specifically citing shopper anxiety over potential tariffs on Chinese goods and a notable backlash following the company\\'s decision in **January 2025** to scale back its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. *This DEI pullback itself followed criticism from conservative activists and the White House, and an earlier controversy in June 2023 over reduced LGBTQ+-themed merchandise for Pride Month.* The tariff situation remains fluid; **President Trump\\'s** threatened 145% import taxes on Chinese goods were reportedly reduced to 30% in a deal on **May 12th**.\\n\\n**Target** is actively working to mitigate these pressures by diversifying its supply chain and negotiating with vendors, stating that price increases are a \"very last resort.\" This contrasts with competitor **Walmart**, which reported strong quarterly sales but indicated it would raise prices due to tariffs. To streamline operations, **Target** is creating a new \"acceleration office\" led by **COO Michael Fiddelke**. The confluence of economic uncertainty, trade policy impacts, and social issue blowback presents a complex challenge for **Target\\'s** leadership.\\n\\n## Tech & science developments\\n\\n<u>**Google Doubles Down on AI: New Tools Unveiled Amid Privacy and Monetization Questions**</u>\\n**Google\\'s** recent I/O event showcased a significant and widespread integration of Artificial Intelligence across its product ecosystem. The company unveiled new generative tools, including **Flow** for AI-powered video creation (integrating **Veo 3** and **Imagen 4** models with **Gemini AI**), and AI-driven enhancements to its core Search product, dubbed **AI Mode**.\\n\\nThe strategy is clear: embed AI seamlessly into users\\' daily interactions with **Google** services, from Search to Gmail and Docs. **CEO Sundar Pichai** emphasized AI as the future of technology. However, this aggressive push is accompanied by familiar concerns. Privacy advocates are scrutinizing new features like an AI shopping tool, despite **Google\\'s** assurances that uploaded user photos for this feature won\\'t be used for training or shared. *Furthermore, Google has begun testing the integration of ads directly into AI Mode search results in the US, raising questions about how it plans to monetize these powerful new AI capabilities and the potential impact on user experience.*\\n\\nThis AI offensive is also a response to intensifying competition, notably from **OpenAI**. **Google** is attempting to leverage its vast existing user base and product suite to deploy AI at scale. The partnership with Oscar-nominated director **Darren Aronofsky** for a generative-AI storytelling initiative signals ambitions beyond mere productivity tools. The central challenge for **Google** will be balancing innovation and market dominance with user trust, particularly concerning data privacy and the intrusiveness of its monetization strategies.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Computex 2025: AMD, Nvidia, and Handhelds Dominate Hardware Showcase**</u>\\n**Computex 2025** in **Taipei** has delivered a barrage of new computing hardware, with **AMD** and **Nvidia** unveiling next-generation silicon and the handheld PC market showing continued explosive growth. **AMD** took center stage with its **Threadripper 9000 series CPUs**, promising up to 22% better performance in threaded workloads, and the **Ryzen Z2 Extreme** chip, designed to power a new wave of handheld gaming devices.\\n\\nOne such device, the **MSI Claw A8**, garnered significant attention. Powered by the aforementioned **AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme**, **MSI** is emphasizing battery life while aiming for 60 frames-per-second gameplay. This reflects a broader trend, with **Lenovo** also active with its **Legion Go S** (reportedly with SteamOS) and upcoming **Legion Go 2**. **Nvidia** is not standing still, with its **RTX 5000 series GPUs** making their presence felt, following earlier launches of specific cards like the **RTX 5060**. *Intel is also competing, with its Core Ultra processors and Arc GPUs appearing in handhelds, alongside professional workstation cards like the Intel B60.*\\n\\nBeyond CPUs and GPUs, the show featured new motherboards like **ASUS\\'s ROG Crosshair x870E Hero BTF** and laptops such as **HP\\'s OmniBook 5 series**, which aims for a balance of affordability, design, and endurance. The overall theme is one of relentless performance improvement, increasing integration of AI capabilities at the hardware level, and the maturation of new form factors like handheld gaming PCs. Availability for many of these new components, including the **Threadripper 9000 series** and the **MSI Claw A8**, is anticipated for later in the year, primarily July and beyond.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Fortnite Back on Apple\\'s App Store After Contentious Legal Saga**</u>\\n**Fortnite**, the massively popular game from **Epic Games**, has made its return to the **Apple App Store** in the **US**. This marks a significant development in the protracted legal battle that began in 2020 when **Epic** attempted to bypass **Apple\\'s** in-app payment system and its associated commission fees, leading to **Fortnite\\'s** removal.\\n\\nThe journey back was arduous, involving multiple court rulings and appeals. While an initial 2021 ruling found **Apple** not in violation of antitrust laws, it did mandate that **Apple** allow developers to link to alternative payment options. **Apple\\'s** subsequent compliance attempts, which included imposing a 27% commission on such external payments, were deemed insufficient by **US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers**, who found **Apple** in civil contempt in **April 2025** for not adequately loosening its grip on the App Store. *It was under this judicial pressure that Apple ultimately reinstated the game.*\\n\\nThe fight is not entirely over. A hearing is scheduled for **May 27th** in **Oakland, California**, to further address **Apple\\'s** compliance with court orders regarding alternative payment systems. This case has been a bellwether for the broader power struggle between app developers and platform giants like **Apple** and **Google**, with significant implications for app store policies, commission structures, and developer freedoms globally. The return of **Fortnite** is a victory for **Epic**, but the final terms of engagement on **Apple\\'s** platform remain a contested issue.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Measles Alert: Shakira Concert at MetLife Stadium a Potential Exposure Site**</u>\\nHealth officials in **New Jersey** have issued a measles exposure warning following confirmation that an individual infected with the virus attended a **Shakira** concert at **MetLife Stadium** on the evening of **May 15th**. Thousands of concertgoers may have been exposed, raising concerns about a potential super-spreader event.\\n\\nThe **New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH)** issued the warning on **May 20th**, advising attendees to check their vaccination status and monitor for symptoms. *Individuals potentially exposed could develop symptoms as late as June 6th.* Measles is a highly contagious airborne virus that can lead to serious complications, particularly in unvaccinated children and immunocompromised individuals.\\n\\nThis warning arrives amidst a backdrop of rising measles cases nationally and declining vaccination rates, a concerning trend that threatens the **US\\'s** measles elimination status achieved in 2000. A significant outbreak is currently ongoing in **Texas**. The **NJDOH** and **CDC** emphasize that vaccination is the most effective preventive measure. This incident underscores the public health risks associated with large gatherings when vaccine-preventable diseases are circulating.\\n\\n## Noteworthy & under-reported\\n\\n<u>**Former Ukrainian Politician Andriy Portnov Gunned Down in Madrid**</u>\\n**Andriy Portnov**, a former Ukrainian politician who served as a senior aide to ousted **President Viktor Yanukovych**, was shot dead in **Madrid** on **May 21st**. The assassination reportedly occurred outside the **American School of Madrid**. **Portnov** fled **Ukraine** in 2014 following the Euromaidan revolution that toppled **Yanukovych**.\\n\\n**Portnov\\'s** career was controversial. He faced EU sanctions (later dropped) and a state treason investigation in **Ukraine** (closed in 2019). He returned to **Ukraine** briefly after **Volodymyr Zelenskyy\\'s** election in 2019 but was subsequently sanctioned by the **US Treasury Department** in 2021 for alleged corruption. He reportedly left **Ukraine** again after **Russia\\'s** full-scale invasion in 2022.\\n\\nSpanish authorities are investigating, with potential motives ranging from political retribution linked to the **Russia-Ukraine** conflict to disputes among criminal organizations. *Spain has unfortunately become a venue for several high-profile crimes involving Russian and Ukrainian nationals since 2022.* The killing of **Portnov**, while not a current major political player, adds another layer to the complex and often violent shadow activities connected to the ongoing war and its preceding political upheavals.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**EPA Budget Cuts Ignite Partisan Firestorm in Senate Hearing**</u>\\nA **Senate Environment and Public Works Committee** hearing on the **Trump administration\\'s** proposed budget cuts for the **Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)** descended into a heated partisan confrontation on **May 21st**. **EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin** faced a barrage of criticism from Democrats, while Republicans defended the cuts as essential for eliminating waste and fostering economic growth.\\n\\n**Democratic Senator Adam Schiff** went as far as accusing **Zeldin** of effectively \"causing cancer\" through deregulation and budget reductions that, he argued, would gut environmental protection efforts. **Senator Sheldon Whitehouse** challenged **Zeldin** on the EPA\\'s review process for grants awarded under the **Biden** administration, accusing the agency of making baseless fraud accusations and harassing career civil servants. **Zeldin** retorted sharply, accusing Democrats of fiscal irresponsibility and political grandstanding, asserting that he and his colleagues were \"busting their a--\" to identify and eliminate waste and abuse within the agency. *The proposed cuts would significantly reduce the EPA\\'s workforce and terminate billions in grants.*\\n\\nThe hearing starkly illustrated the deep ideological chasm over environmental policy and the EPA\\'s role. Democrats foresee dire public health and environmental consequences from a weakened EPA, while the **Trump** administration frames its approach as a necessary corrective to overreach and inefficiency, aiming to \"turbocharge\" the economy while ensuring clean air and water. The specifics of the grants under review and the true extent of any \"waste\" remain contentious points.\\n\\n---\\n<u>**Jay Slater Inquest Adjourned Amid Mother\\'s Plea; Fan Clashes Mar Europa League Final Build-Up**</u>\\nThe inquest into the death of **Jay Slater**, a British teenager whose body was found in **Tenerife** in **July 2024** after he went missing in June, was adjourned on **May 21st**. The adjournment came after **Slater\\'s** mother, **Debbie Duncan**, pleaded for key witnesses to be compelled to testify. The inquest revealed that traces of cocaine, ecstasy, and ketamine were found in **Slater\\'s** system. Several friends who were with him in **Tenerife**, including **Lucy Law** (whom he called when lost) and individuals who rented the Airbnb where he was last seen, failed to appear.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in unrelated news with a UK interest, the **Europa League final** between **Manchester United** and **Tottenham Hotspur** is set to take place in **Bilbao, Spain**. The build-up has been marred by reports of fan misbehavior, including clashes between supporters of the two English clubs in **San Sebastian** and **Bilbao**. Tens of thousands of fans are descending on the city, with both teams vying for the trophy and a coveted Champions League spot. *Authorities in Bilbao are reportedly mounting a large security operation.*\\n\\nThe **Slater** inquest highlights the family\\'s ongoing search for answers and the difficulties in piecing together the final hours of his life, particularly with absent key witnesses. The Europa League final, while a significant sporting event, carries the unfortunate but familiar risk of fan disorder, requiring substantial policing efforts to manage.\\n</final_brief>\\n\\n**Required Output Format:**\\n\\nYour entire output must consist **only** of a list of summaries, one for each identified major story.

      "# M&S Cyberattack, UK Inflation Spike, COVID Vaccine Shift & Global Tensions\n",
      "\n",
      "## Main Stories\n",
      "\n",
      "<u>**M&S Cyberattack: Retail Giant Stares Down £300m Loss, Data Breach Confirmed**</u>\n",
      "**Marks & Spencer** is grappling with the aftermath of a significant ransomware attack, attributed to the **Scattered Spider** hacking group, which struck over the **Easter weekend**. The financial fallout is stark: an estimated **£300 million** hit to trading profits. Beyond the balance sheet, customer personal data was compromised, including potential exposure of names, addresses, and birth dates. Online operations suffered considerable disruption, with website downtime and order suspensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The retailer anticipates these operational headaches will persist into **July** as system restoration continues. This incident isn't just a technical or financial problem; it's a direct hit to customer trust and operational stability. **M&S CEO Stuart Machin** has framed it as a \"bump in the road\" and an opportunity to accelerate technology transformation, a brave face on a costly reality. The **Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)** looms in the background, with a potential investigation and fine adding to M&S's woes. *The attack involved the deployment of DragonForce ransomware to VMware ESXi hosts in late April, following an initial suspected breach by Scattered Spider around February 2025.*\n",
      "\n",
      "This attack underscores the persistent and evolving threat ransomware poses to major corporations, particularly in the retail sector. **Scattered Spider** is not an unknown entity, having reportedly targeted other UK retailers like **Co-op** and **Harrods**. The key questions now revolve around the specifics of the \"human error\" M&S alluded to, whether a ransom was paid, and the long-term impact on brand loyalty. The incident serves as a costly reminder that cybersecurity underinvestment, or even a momentary lapse, can have cascading and severe consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "<u>**UK Inflation Jumps to 3.5%, Squeezing Households and Forcing BoE's Hand**</u>\n",
      "The United Kingdom's inflation rate unexpectedly surged to **3.5%** in **April 2025**, marking its highest level in over a year. This unwelcome development, primarily driven by rising energy and water bills, has intensified the ongoing cost of living crisis and thrown a wrench into the **Bank of England's** interest rate strategy. Economists had anticipated an increase, but the actual figure overshot forecasts, pushing inflation further from the Bank's **2% target**.\n",
      "\n",
      "The political ramifications were immediate. **Chancellor Rachel Reeves (Labour)** expressed disappointment, acknowledging the pressure on working people, while **Shadow Chancellor Mel Stride (Conservative)** laid the blame squarely on **Labour's** economic mismanagement. This rise complicates the **Bank of England's** path; after four rate cuts between August 2024 and May 2025 brought rates to 4.25%, further easing now looks less certain. *The Bank projects inflation to peak at 3.7% between July and September 2025, only returning to its 2% target in early 2027.*\n",
      "\n",
      "This inflationary spike isn't occurring in a vacuum. It follows a period where inflation had fallen close to target in mid-2024, after peaking above 11% in late 2022 post-Ukraine invasion. The current government, led by **Prime Minister Keir Starmer**, now faces heightened scrutiny over its economic stewardship. The debate over causes is also telling: some point to the timing of Easter, others to rises in National Insurance Contributions for employers and a higher minimum wage. Regardless of the precise drivers, the reality for households is continued financial strain, and for policymakers, a difficult balancing act between curbing inflation and supporting a fragile recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "<u>**FDA Tightens COVID Vaccine Access, Moderna Pulls Combo Shot Application**</u>\n",
      "The **US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)** is significantly altering its approach to COVID-19 vaccines, now requiring new clinical trials for healthy individuals under 65 before approving annual boosters. Updates for high-risk groups, including seniors, will continue under the existing framework. This policy shift coincides with **Moderna's** decision to withdraw its application for a combined flu-COVID shot, following discussions with the agency.\n",
      "\n",
      "This recalibration appears influenced by new leadership at the **Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)**, now headed by **Robert F. Kennedy Jr.**, and at the **FDA** itself, with **Dr. Martin Makary** as Commissioner and **Dr. Vinay Prasad** heading the vaccine division. The stated rationale centers on concerns about vaccine efficacy for lower-risk populations and the need for more robust, placebo-controlled trial data. *Previously, annual COVID shots were recommended for nearly everyone aged 6 months and older.* The FDA is still due to decide on **Moderna’s** next-generation COVID-19 vaccine by late May.\n",
      "\n",
      "The move signals a departure from the \"one-size-fits-all\" regulatory approach adopted during the pandemic's peak. **Pfizer** has stated it stands by the science behind its vaccine and the benefits of broad vaccination programs. The FDA's new stance, however, suggests a pivot towards a more risk-stratified approval process, aligning somewhat with policies already in place in some other developed nations. This will undoubtedly impact vaccine manufacturers' strategies and public uptake, while also fueling the ongoing debate about vaccine mandates and long-term COVID management.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "<u>**Record Floods Batter New South Wales, Australia: Fatalities and Mass Rescues**</u>\n",
      "**New South Wales, Australia**, is reeling from record-breaking floods that have devastated its **Hunter** and **Mid North Coast** regions. Described as a \"one-in-500-year flood,\" the event has resulted in at least two confirmed fatalities, including **63-year-old David Knowles** found in **Coopernook**, and a **25-year-old male** near **Wauchope**. The **NSW State Emergency Service (SES)** has conducted hundreds of flood rescues, airlifting residents from rooftops as thousands remain isolated.\n",
      "\n",
      "The **Manning River** at **Taree** surpassed its 1929 record, reaching **6.37 meters**, indicative of the deluge's severity. Both state and federal governments, led by **NSW Premier Chris Minns** and **Federal Emergency Management Minister Kristy McBain** respectively, have declared the affected areas natural disaster zones, activating relief assistance. *Heavy rainfall is ongoing, with warnings of further flooding, exacerbating an already dire situation where some areas were saturated from previous events like Cyclone Alfred in March.*\n",
      "\n",
      "This disaster highlights the acute vulnerability of communities to extreme weather. While emergency services are stretched, the focus is shifting towards the long-term impact on infrastructure, livelihoods, and the psychological toll on affected residents. The scale of this event will inevitably lead to questions about climate change adaptation, infrastructure resilience, and disaster preparedness in flood-prone regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "<u>**School Bus Bombed in Balochistan, Pakistan; Islamabad Points Finger at India**</u>\n",
      "A suicide car bombing targeting a school bus in **Khuzdar, Balochistan, Pakistan**, has killed at least four children and several adults, with dozens more injured. The bus was en route to a military-run school. In a swift and direct accusation, **Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif** blamed **India** for the attack, alleging Indian support for terrorists operating in the restive province. **India** has denied these claims.\n",
      "\n",
      "No group immediately claimed responsibility for the **May 21st** bombing. However, Balochistan has a long-running separatist insurgency, with groups like the **Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA)** frequently targeting state symbols and security forces. *This attack follows a BLA attack on a train in March 2025 that killed 33, mostly soldiers, and occurs despite a fragile ceasefire agreed between India and Pakistan in Kashmir earlier in May.*\n",
      "\n",
      "The targeting of a school bus carrying children is a grim escalation, regardless of the perpetrator. **Sharif's** immediate accusation against **India** significantly raises regional tensions, already high due to the Kashmir dispute and historical mistrust. The incident will likely fuel further instability in **Balochistan**, a strategically important province due to its mineral resources and the **China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)**. The key questions now are whether any group will claim responsibility and if **Pakistan** will present credible evidence for its accusations against **India**, or if this will become another point of bitter contention between the nuclear-armed neighbors.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "<u>**Russian GRU Hackers Target Ukraine Aid Logistics in Sustained Cyber Campaign**</u>\n",
      "A persistent cyber campaign orchestrated by **Russian GRU Unit 26165**, also known as **Fancy Bear** or **Forest Blizzard**, has been targeting logistics and technology firms involved in delivering aid to **Ukraine** since early 2022. The attacks employ methods such as credential guessing, spear-phishing, and exploiting vulnerabilities, with the clear aim of disrupting assistance flows and gathering intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The **UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)**, alongside allies including the **US, Germany, and France**, issued a joint advisory on **May 21st** to expose this malicious activity and urge organizations to bolster their defenses. Targets have reportedly included air traffic control, airports, defense contractors, IT service providers, maritime operations, and even internet-connected cameras at Ukrainian border crossings to track aid shipments. *This campaign expanded significantly around the time of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.*\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not merely opportunistic hacking; it's a state-sponsored effort integral to **Russia's** broader war strategy against **Ukraine**. By targeting the logistical backbone of international aid, **Moscow** seeks to undermine **Ukraine's** resilience and defense capabilities. The joint advisory signals a coordinated Western response to this cyber front, but the challenge remains for numerous, often smaller, entities in the supply chain to implement robust security against a sophisticated and determined adversary like **GRU Unit 26165**. The full extent of the damage and the specific vulnerabilities exploited remain key information gaps.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "<u>**DOJ Probes Former NY Governor Cuomo's COVID Testimony**</u>\n",
      "The **US Department of Justice (DOJ)** has initiated a criminal investigation into former **New York Governor Andrew Cuomo** concerning his testimony to Congress regarding his administration's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically related to nursing home deaths. This probe follows a referral from House Republicans who allege **Cuomo** lied to the **House Oversight Committee**.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cuomo**, who resigned in August 2021 amid sexual harassment allegations and is now running for **New York City mayor**, has, through his spokesperson **Rich Azzopardi**, decried the investigation as politically motivated election interference. *The controversy dates back to a 2020 directive requiring nursing homes to accept recovering COVID-19 patients and subsequent allegations that Cuomo's administration underreported related deaths.* The investigation is reportedly being overseen by **Jeanine Pirro**, the new head of the U.S. attorney's office in Washington, who has a past political rivalry with **Cuomo**.\n",
      "\n",
      "This investigation re-ignites a painful chapter of the pandemic and thrusts **Cuomo's** controversial tenure back into the spotlight, just as he attempts a political comeback. The timing, coinciding with his mayoral run and the recent dropping of a corruption case against current **NYC Mayor Eric Adams**, will inevitably fuel accusations of political weaponization of the **DOJ**. The core of the investigation will likely scrutinize discrepancies between **Cuomo's** testimony and evidence regarding his office's involvement in drafting a state report on nursing home deaths.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "<u>**Trump Administration's Deportation and Police Reform Reversals Face Court Scrutiny**</u>\n",
      "The **Trump administration** is encountering significant legal headwinds over its aggressive deportation policies and a rollback of **Biden-era** police reforms. A federal judge, **Brian Murphy**, has accused the administration of violating due process and potentially being in contempt of court for deporting migrants to **South Sudan** despite a court order mandating they have a chance to challenge such removals to third countries. *The deportation flight proceeded on May 21st, prompting an emergency hearing where Judge Murphy admonished the administration.*\n",
      "\n",
      "Simultaneously, the **Department of Justice (DOJ)**, under **Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon**, is moving to dismiss lawsuits and end investigations into police departments in cities like **Minneapolis** and **Louisville**, which were initiated following high-profile incidents like the death of **George Floyd**. The **DOJ** is also retracting previous findings of constitutional violations. This reversal is drawing sharp criticism from civil rights advocates, who warn it will undermine police accountability. **Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem** has defended the deportations, citing the criminal records of some migrants.\n",
      "\n",
      "These actions signal a sharp divergence from the previous administration's approach to both immigration and police oversight. The legal challenge to deportations highlights a fundamental tension between executive authority and judicial review, particularly concerning due process for migrants. The dismantling of police consent decrees and investigations represents a significant policy shift, prioritizing local control over federal oversight, a move critics argue will reverse progress made on police accountability and racial justice. The administration's claim of compliance with court orders in the deportation case is directly contested by the presiding judge, setting the stage for further legal battles.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "<u>**Biden's Post-Presidency Health Diagnosis and Cognitive Decline Allegations Ignite Political Firestorm**</u>\n",
      "Former President **Joe Biden's** recent prostate cancer diagnosis and persistent allegations of cognitive decline during his presidency have erupted into a significant political controversy. Claims are surfacing, notably in a new book, 'Original Sin' by **Jake Tapper** and **Alex Thompson**, that there was an effort to cover up the extent of **Biden's** condition while he was in office. This has led to accusations of elder abuse and even calls for scrutiny of **Jill Biden's** role.\n",
      "\n",
      "**President Trump** has publicly questioned the timing of the cancer diagnosis, suggesting it should have been revealed earlier, and has accused **Biden's** former staff of manipulating him. *Biden withdrew from the 2024 presidential race in July 2024, citing cognitive concerns, with Kamala Harris then becoming the Democratic nominee.* The book reportedly details incidents such as an attempted filming of a fake town hall in spring 2024 that was unusable due to **Biden's** incoherence. **Biden** himself has rejected notions of significant cognitive decline.\n",
      "\n",
      "This situation is politically charged, with the reliability of various claims heavily influenced by partisan leanings. The core issue, however, is the health and capacity of a recent president and the transparency surrounding it. The allegations, if substantiated, raise serious questions about the decision-making processes within the **Biden White House** and the ethical responsibilities of those around him. The controversy also provides ample ammunition for political opponents and fuels ongoing debates about age and fitness for office.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "<u>**EU & UK Slap New Sanctions on Russian Oil; US Hesitates, Prioritizing Putin Talks**</u>\n",
      "The **European Union** and the **United Kingdom** have jointly announced a new wave of sanctions targeting **Russia's** oil exports, specifically its 'shadow fleet' of tankers used to circumvent existing restrictions. This move aims to further pressure **Moscow** over its continued aggression in **Ukraine**. However, this coordinated European action contrasts with a more hesitant stance from **Washington**, where **President Trump** is reportedly reluctant to impose further sanctions, prioritizing potential negotiations with **Russian President Vladimir Putin**.\n",
      "\n",
      "This divergence became apparent following a two-hour phone call between **Trump** and **Putin** on **May 20th**, which yielded no breakthrough on a ceasefire. **Trump** also spoke with **Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy**. *The EU's Ursula von der Leyen stressed the need to intensify pressure, while Trump fears new sanctions could hinder mediation efforts.* Meanwhile, fighting persists in eastern **Ukraine**, and cross-border attacks, including a Ukrainian drone strike on a semiconductor plant in **Russia's Oryol region**, continue. **Putin** subsequently visited the **Kursk** region, previously site of a Ukrainian incursion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The differing approaches on sanctions highlight a potential fracture in Western unity against **Russia**. While the **EU** and **UK** are doubling down on economic pressure, the **US** under **Trump** appears to be exploring a more direct diplomatic track with **Putin**, even suggesting a future restart of trade with **Russia** post-conflict. This could embolden **Putin** and complicate **Ukraine's** position. The G7 finance ministers are currently meeting in **Canada**, where these trade tensions and disagreements over Russia policy will undoubtedly be a contentious topic.\n",

      "\n",
      "<u>**UK Government Reverses Course on Winter Fuel Payment Cuts After Backlash**</u>\n",
      "The **Labour** government, under **Prime Minister Keir Starmer**, has executed a significant U-turn, reversing its earlier decision to cut winter fuel payments for pensioners. The initial policy, which restricted eligibility to those on means-tested benefits and was championed by **Chancellor Rachel Reeves** as a cost-saving measure, provoked considerable political backlash and was blamed for **Labour's** poor showing in recent local elections.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Starmer** signaled the policy shift during Prime Minister's Questions, linking the reversal to purported improvements in the UK economy. The government now intends to widen eligibility for the payments, with specifics to be unveiled in the autumn budget. *The original cuts, announced around July 2024, were projected to save the Treasury between £1.3 billion and £1.5 billion annually.* This reversal follows concerns voiced by **Labour** MPs, some of whom threatened a rebellion.\n",
      "\n",
      "This episode highlights the acute tension between fiscal consolidation and political reality, especially amidst a persistent cost of living crisis. While **Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall** has been advocating for broader welfare reforms, the unpopularity of the winter fuel cuts proved too potent. The U-turn may appease some critics but raises questions about the government's decisiveness and the coherence of its broader welfare agenda. Opponents, like **Tory Leader Kemi Badenoch** and **Lib Dem Leader Ed Davey**, have seized on the reversal as evidence of a government in disarray.\n",

      "<u>**Fatal Blaze at Bicester Motion Claims Lives of Two Firefighters, One Civilian**</u>\n",
      "A tragic fire at **Bicester Motion**, a former RAF base in **Oxfordshire**, has resulted in the deaths of two firefighters, **Martyn Sadler** and **Jennie Logan**, and a member of the public, **David Chester**. Tributes have been paid to all three, particularly highlighting the bravery of the firefighters and **Mr. Chester's** selfless actions in assisting them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fire, which broke out around **May 16th**, also left two other firefighters with serious injuries; they have since been reported by **Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service** as conscious and in stable condition. **Thames Valley Police** are investigating the cause of the blaze, which is currently being treated as unexplained, though a criminal investigation has been ruled out for now. *The area was declared safe on May 20th after the fire was brought under control.*\n",
      "\n",
      "This incident is a stark reminder of the dangers faced by emergency service personnel. The loss of life has deeply affected the local community and the firefighting fraternity.

      "The English Channel has claimed more lives, with a woman and a child dying in an attempt to cross from **France** to **Britain** in a small boat on **May 21st**. This brings the death toll for the week to at least three, and for the year to at least fourteen. French rescue services discovered the two unconscious individuals aboard a vessel carrying nearly 80 migrants off the **Pas de Calais** coast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the evident dangers, the crossings persist. Over **12,748** individuals have made the journey so far this year. In this latest incident, a French Navy vessel rescued 10 people, while the remaining migrants continued towards the UK. *Earlier in the week, another migrant died and one was reported missing when their boat broke apart.*\n",
      "\n",
      "These recurring tragedies fuel the contentious debate over how to manage irregular migration. Charities like **Safe Passage International** reiterate calls for safer, legal routes for asylum seekers, arguing these deaths are preventable. However, governments on both sides of the Channel face political pressure to curb the crossings, often focusing on deterrence and enforcement.

      "A **Senate Environment and Public Works Committee** hearing on the **Trump administration's** proposed budget cuts for the **Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)** descended into a heated partisan confrontation on **May 21st**. **EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin** faced a barrage of criticism from Democrats, while Republicans defended the cuts as essential for eliminating waste and fostering economic growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Democratic Senator Adam Schiff** went as far as accusing **Zeldin** of effectively \"causing cancer\" through deregulation and budget reductions that, he argued, would gut environmental protection efforts. **Senator Sheldon Whitehouse** challenged **Zeldin** on the EPA's review process for grants awarded under the **Biden** administration, accusing the agency of making baseless fraud accusations and harassing career civil servants. **Zeldin** retorted sharply, accusing Democrats of fiscal irresponsibility and political grandstanding, asserting that he and his colleagues were \"busting their a--\" to identify and eliminate waste and abuse within the agency. *The proposed cuts would significantly reduce the EPA's workforce and terminate billions in grants.*\n",
      "\n",
      "The hearing starkly illustrated the deep ideological chasm over environmental policy and the EPA's role. Democrats foresee dire public health and environmental consequences from a weakened EPA, while the **Trump** administration frames its approach as a necessary corrective to overreach and inefficiency, aiming to \"turbocharge\" the economy while ensuring clean air and water. The specifics of the grants under review and the true extent of any \"waste\" remain contentious points.\n",

      "<u>**Jay Slater Inquest Adjourned Amid Mother's Plea; Fan Clashes Mar Europa League Final Build-Up**</u>\n",
      "The inquest into the death of **Jay Slater**, a British teenager whose body was found in **Tenerife** in **July 2024** after he went missing in June, was adjourned on **May 21st**. The adjournment came after **Slater's** mother, **Debbie Duncan**, pleaded for key witnesses to be compelled to testify. The inquest revealed that traces of cocaine, ecstasy, and ketamine were found in **Slater's** system. Several friends who were with him in **Tenerife**, including **Lucy Law** (whom he called when lost) and individuals who rented the Airbnb where he was last seen, failed to appear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, in unrelated news with a UK interest, the **Europa League final** between **Manchester United** and **Tottenham Hotspur** is set to take place in **Bilbao, Spain**. The build-up has been marred by reports of fan misbehavior, including clashes between supporters of the two English clubs in **San Sebastian** and **Bilbao**. Tens of thousands of fans are descending on the city, with both teams vying for the trophy and a coveted Champions League spot. *Authorities in Bilbao are reportedly mounting a large security operation.*\n",
      "\n",
      "The **Slater** inquest highlights the family's ongoing search for answers and the difficulties in piecing together the final hours of his life, particularly with absent key witnesses. The Europa League final, while a significant sporting event, carries the unfortunate but familiar risk of fan disorder, requiring substantial policing efforts to manage.\n"
