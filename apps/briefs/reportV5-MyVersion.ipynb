It marks at least the second health-related pick from Trump to be pulled from Senate consideration. Nesheiwat had been scheduled to appear before the Senate health, education, labor and pensions committee on Thursday for her confirmation hearing.Means and her brother, former lobbyist Calley Means, served as key advisers to Kennedy’s longshot 2024 presidential bid and helped broker his endorsement of Trump last summer. The pair made appearances with some of Trump’s biggest supporters, winning praise from conservative pundit Tucker Carlson and podcaster Joe Rogan. Calley Means is currently a White House adviser who appears frequently on television to promote restrictions on Snap benefits, removing fluoride from drinking water and other Maha agenda items.Casey Means has no government experience and dropped out of her surgical residency program, saying she became disillusioned with traditional medicine. She founded a health tech company, Levels, that helps users track blood sugar and other metrics. She also makes money from dietary supplements, creams, teas and other products sponsored on her social media accounts.In interviews and articles, Means and her brother describe a dizzying web of influences to blame for the nation’s health problems, including corrupt food conglomerates that have hooked Americans on unhealthy diets, leaving them reliant on daily medications from the pharmaceutical industry to manage obesity, diabetes and other chronic conditions.Few health experts would dispute that the US diet – full of processed foods – is a contributor to obesity and related problems. But Means goes further, linking changes in diet and lifestyle to a raft of conditions including infertility, Alzheimer’s, depression and erectile dysfunction.“Almost every chronic health symptom that Western medicine addresses is the result of our cells being beleaguered by how we’ve come to live,” Means said in a 2024 book co-written with her brother.Food experts say it’s overly simplistic to declare that all processed foods are harmful, since the designation covers an estimated 60% of US foods, including products as diverse as granola, peanut butter and potato chips.“They are not all created equal,” said Gabby Headrick, a nutrition researcher at George Washington University’s school of public health. “It is much more complicated than just pointing the finger at ultra-processed foods as the driver of chronic disease in the United States.”Means has mostly steered clear of Kennedy’s debunked views on vaccines. But on her website, she has called for more investigation into their safety and recommends making it easier for patients to sue drugmakers in the event of vaccine injuries. Since the late 1980s, federal law has shielded those companies from legal liability to encourage development of vaccines without the threat of costly personal injury lawsuits.She trained as a surgeon at Stanford University but has built an online following by criticizing the medical establishment and promoting natural foods and lifestyle changes to reverse obesity, diabetes and other chronic diseases.If confirmed as surgeon general, Means would be tasked with helping promote Kennedy’s sprawling Maha agenda, which calls for removing thousands of additives and chemicals from US foods, rooting out conflicts of interest at federal agencies and incentivizing healthier foods in school lunches and other nutrition programs.Nesheiwat, Trump’s first pick, is a medical director for an urgent care company in New York and has appeared regularly on Fox News to offer medical expertise and insights. She is a vocal supporter of Trump and shares photos of them together on social media. Nesheiwat is also the sister-in-law of former national security adviser Mike Waltz, who has been nominated to be Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations.Nesheiwat also recently came under criticism from Laura Loomer, a far-right ally of Trump who was instrumental in ousting several members of Trump’s national security council. Loomer posted on Twitter/X earlier this week that “we can’t have a pro-COVID vaccine nepo appointee who is currently embroiled in a medical malpractice case and who didn’t go to medical school in the US” as the surgeon general.Independent freelance journalist Anthony Clark reported last month that Nesheiwat earned her medical degree from the American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine in St Maarten, despite saying that she has a degree from the University of Arkansas School of Medicine.The surgeon general, considered the nation’s doctor, oversees 6,000 US Public Health Service Corps members and can issue advisories that warn of public health threats.In March, the White House pulled from consideration the nomination of former Florida Republican Dave Weldon to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. His skepticism on vaccines had raised concerns from key Republican senators, and he withdrew after being told by the White House that he did not have enough support to be confirmed.The withdrawal was first reported by Bloomberg News.', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Trump nominates Means for Surgeon General\\nENTITIES: Donald Trump, Casey Means, Robert F Kennedy Jr, Janette Nesheiwat\\nEVENT: Trump nominated Dr. Casey Means, linked to RFK Jr., for surgeon general, replacing Janette Nesheiwat.\\nCONTEXT: Means' nomination signals a shift towards alternative medicine perspectives.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 51414, 'sourceId': 12678, 'url': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14688557/canned-beans-recall-states-life-threatening-health-risk-NEW.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490', 'title': \"Canned beans recalled in 23 states over 'life-threatening' health risk\", 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T18:08:09.000Z', 'content': \"18:33, 07 May 2025, updated\\n19:08, 07 May 2025\\nBy\\nLUKE ANDREWS SENIOR HEALTH REPORTER FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\\nREAD MORE: Urgent recall for breakfast item that may contain plastic\\nAn urgent recall\\xa0has been issued for canned beans sold at Walmart\\xa0and other grocers over fears they pose a life-threatening health risk.The FDA\\xa0is recalling 4,510 cases of Yellowstone Brown Sugar Molasses Baked Beans sold across 23 states because they contain undeclared soy.About 1.9million people in the US are allergic to soy, and can suffer from anaphylaxis if they eat the substance — a life-threatening allergic reaction that can leave them gasping for breath.No illnesses or adverse reactions have been reported to date, but the FDA is urging people to throw out the beans or return them to stores for a full refund.The beans are sold in 15-ounce cans with a best-by date of February 17, 2028 — and were made by Tennessee-based Vietti Food Group.The can has a black label with a large, yellow 'Y' on the front, as well a a picture of beans cooking in a saucepan.A representative for the brand said the affected beans were sold in Walmart, Associated Wholesale Grocers, Hy-Vee and Meijer, among others. The above is a stock image of beans. It was a brand sold by Vietti Food Group that was recalled because it contained undeclared soy The above shows the label used on the recalled canned beans The FDA said in its alert: 'Individuals with an allergy or severe sensitivity to soy risk serious or life-threatening allergic reactions if they consume this product.'\\xa0The recall was called in the following states: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Virginia.It was not clear exactly how many cans of beans were being recalled or how the soy had entered the baked beans.But it is likely that the soy was contained in the sauce, where it is used to tone down the sweetness and add depth to the flavor.Food workers then did not declare the sauce's presence on the label, which led to the recall.Soy comes from soybeans and is commonly consumed in foods. It is one of nine major allergens, with the others being milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat and sesame.It poses no risks to someone who does not have a soy allergy.But for patients with this, they can quickly experience a tingling sensation in the mouth and swelling of the lips and face after consuming soy.Experts say they can also break out in hives, itching or eczema, and suffer from abdominal pain, diarrhea and nausea.It comes after a March recall was issued for 200,000 cans of popular vegetables sold at Target over fears they were contaminated with a foreign object.Good & Gather Cut Green Beans - distributed by Target - have been recalled in just about two dozen states, including Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Texas. On February 12, 197,808 cans were recalled. On March 13, the recall was named as the second-highest risk level, or a 'Class II' distinction.The FDA did not explain in its release what sort of foreign object had been found in the cans, but these are typically pits and bones that have not been removed.\", 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Canned beans recalled over undeclared soy\\nENTITIES: FDA, Walmart, Vietti Food Group, Yellowstone Brown Sugar Molasses Baked Beans\\nEVENT: 4,510 cases of Yellowstone Brown Sugar Molasses Baked Beans are recalled across 23 states due to undeclared soy.\\nCONTEXT: Undeclared soy poses a life-threatening risk to those allergic.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 52602, 'sourceId': 12322, 'url': 'https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-politics-newsletter-biden-appointed-judge-orders-refugee-resettlement-resumed', 'title': 'Fox News Politics Newsletter: Biden-appointed Judge Orders Refugee Resettlement Resumed', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T21:53:35.000Z', 'content': 'Welcome to the Fox News Politics newsletter, with the latest updates on the Trump administration, Capitol Hill and more Fox News politics content.Here\\'s what\\'s happening…-Vance previews US-Iran nuclear talks, says Trump \\'open\\' to sitting down with Russians, Chinese in future-Congress moves to address air traffic controller crisis as Newark meltdown sparks alarm-205 arrested in FBI child sex operation, Patel and Bondi announceJudge Orders Refugee Resettlement to ResumeA federal judge on Monday ordered the Trump administration to immediately resettle some 12,000 refugees into the U.S. under a court order that partially blocks President Donald Trump’s executive order aimed at halting the refugee admissions program.\\xa0U.S. District Judge Jamal Whitehead, a 2023 appointee of former President Joe Biden, issued the order despite the Trump administration saying during a hearing last week that it should only have to process 160 refugees into the country and would likely appeal any order requiring thousands to be admitted.\"This Court will not entertain the Government’s result-oriented rewriting of a judicial order that clearly says what it says,\" Whitehead wrote Monday. \"The Government is free, of course, to seek further clarification from the Ninth Circuit.

Launched today by Employment Hero, this mobile app is shaking up the hiring game, offering SMEs a free, fast, and mobile-first way to connect with job seekers.\\nUnlike traditional job boards, EH Jobs is built for the smartphone era, where candidates hunt for work between shifts or on the go. The app’s AI-driven features, like SmartMatch, pair SMEs with local talent in seconds, slashing recruitment time and costs. It also taps into the 80% of jobs never publicly advertised, giving smaller businesses a leg up in a tight labor market.\\nDavid Holland, Managing Director of Talent Solutions at Employment Hero, told reporters: “The job hunt has changed. People aren’t sitting at a desktop scrolling through listings anymore. Job hunting has become part of daily life; Aussies are looking for work between shifts, on the train, on their phone during smoko, even while scrolling TikTok.”\\nTailored for fast-paced SME hiring\\nWith employment growth stuck at 1.5% quarter-on-quarter and wages inching up by just 0.7%, SMEs face mounting pressure to fill roles quickly. EH Jobs delivers with features tailored for shift-based hiring: map-based candidate searches, AI-polished profiles with video intros, and direct 1:1 chats with applicants. Holland highlighted the app’s speed: “EH Jobs is designed for that reality, a fast, mobile-first experience that removes friction on both sides of the marketplace and integrates with how people use technology today. Our record so far is just 18 minutes from a candidate seeing a business listing and successfully scheduling a Trial Shift. I expect that record will continue to tumble.”\\nThe app’s focus on casual and frontline roles is a boon for SMEs, which employ 70% of Australia’s workforce but often lack the HR firepower of larger firms. “This isn’t just another job board,” Holland said. “We’re bringing a sense of immediacy to job seeking, especially for those in casual and shift-based roles, where speed and simplicity make all the difference.”\\nEH Jobs also integrates with Employment Hero’s broader platform, offering SMEs tools to streamline HR and payroll. A new feature, ShiftSync, allows SMEs to post real-time shift openings directly to the app, instantly notifying nearby candidates who match the job criteria. This ensures businesses can fill last-minute vacancies, a common pain point in hospitality and retail. “EH Jobs is the front door to a more connected employment experience; one that benefits jobseekers and businesses alike,” Holland added.\\nFor more information, visit\\xa0employmenthero.com\\nKeep up to date with our stories on\\xa0LinkedIn,\\xa0Twitter,\\xa0Facebook\\xa0and\\xa0Instagram.', 'location': 'AUS', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Employment Hero launches free SME hiring app\\nENTITIES: Employment Hero, David Holland, Australian SMEs\\nEVENT: Employment Hero launched EH Jobs, a free mobile app designed to help Australian SMEs in hospitality, retail, and frontline sectors quickly connect with job seekers.\\nCONTEXT: App helps SMEs tackle talent shortages with mobile-first approach.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 49407, 'sourceId': 12490, 'url': 'https://www.pcworld.com/article/2774978/microsoft-trims-its-low-end-surfaces-to-make-room-for-smaller-models.html', 'title': 'Microsoft trims its low-end Surfaces to make room for smaller models', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T19:51:59.000Z', 'content': \"Image: Microsoft\\nAfter introducing smaller, lower-priced Surface devices this week, Microsoft has quietly raised the prices of its older Surface devices to compensate — well, kind of.\\nMicrosoft launched a new 13-inch Surface Laptop for as low as $899.99 and a 12-inch Surface Pro for $799.99. The two devices are just a tad smaller than the existing Surface Laptop and Surface Pro and slightly cheaper as well: the base prices of the existing, older Surface Laptop 7th Edition and the Surface Pro 11th Edition are $999.\\nAs reported by XDA Developers, Microsoft has now widened the pricing gap, implementing a $200 difference between the smaller Surface Pro and Laptop and the existing models from May 2024. But that’s not precisely true, either.\\nInstead, Microsoft has eliminated the lowest-priced 13.8-inch Surface Laptop offering from its website. Last May, you could buy a 13.8-inch Surface Laptop, in Platinum, with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD storage, for $999, according to the price list Microsoft provided us. Now, the cheapest 13.8-inch Surface Laptop is a Black model but with 16GB of RAM and a larger 512GB SSD instead, with an MSRP of $1,199.99 — but one of those models, too, has been marked down to a discounted $1,031.47. (Microsoft sometimes offers educational or military discounts, but I used an anonymous browser to check that information.) Otherwise, the MSRP of that model remains the same as last May.\\nIt also appears that the remaining devices in the existing 13.8- and 15-inch Surface Laptop line have retained the same pricing as before, too.\\nIn the 15-inch Laptop, Microsoft says that the cheapest $1,299 option (a Platinum model with a Snapdragon X Elite, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD) is out of stock. But the next step up the ladder remains unchanged at $1,499.99 for a black laptop with an X Elite / 16GB RAM / 512GB SSD.. The other models are, too, up to the top-of-the-line $2,499 model, which is now out of stock as well.\\nMicrosoft appears to be making slight tweaks in its Surface Pro line as well. Again, Microsoft appears to have removed all of its Surface Pro 11th Edition models with 256GB of SSD storage. That effectively eliminated the cheapest $999.99 model from last year. Now, the cheapest 13-inch Surface Pros carry an MSRP of $1,199 for models with Wi-Fi, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. Even then, Microsoft has marked down the Sapphire version to $1,029.99, a $170 discount.\\nOtherwise, it seems like the other Surface Pro prices, for both the OLED and LCD models, remain the same. (A $1,299 Platinum model is now out of stock.)\\nEssentially, Microsoft is raising prices by eliminating its cheapest options from its existing Surface Pro and Surface Laptop lineups and carving out more space for the smaller Surfaces to exist. And it’s unclear whether Microsoft will leave those discounts at the low end in place.\\nFor now, though, it appears that the Surface prices are safe.\\nAuthor: Mark Hachman, Senior Editor, PCWorld\\nMark has written for PCWorld for the last decade, with 30 years of experience covering technology.

Well, now we know.Samsung’s just dropped invites for its next Galaxy Unpacked, and it’s an entirely virtual affair with a clear focus – the Galaxy S25 Edge. Even with its ultra-thin design that will land at under the Galaxy S25\\'s 7.2-milimeters, it\\'s still poking its way through the center of the invite.The invite image reveals, under a cloth of some kind, the super slim silhouette. It’s accompanied by “Beyond slim” on the left and “May 12, 2025 Live on samsung.com” on the right.That basically gives it away, and Samsung will stream this Galaxy Unpacked at 8pm ET/5pm PT/1am BST/ (10am AEST on May 13, 2025 in Australia) live on its site and on YouTube.(Image credit: Samsung)A shared blog post from Samsung details much more on this addition to the Galaxy S lineup and actually names the Galaxy S25 Edge, writing, “This is more than a slim smartphone.” It teases that the Galaxy S25 Edge will offer flagship-level performance with ‘superior portability’ without compromising on any of it, seemingly.It also confirms a key spec for the Edge that’s been rummored alongside many others. “Even with its slim form, Galaxy S25 Edge’s 200MP wide lens continues Galaxy’s iconic camera experience, delivering pro-grade capabilities to intuitively capture the world around you,” thus confirming the ultra-slim phone will have a very sharp main shooter. It will also match the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which has the same sensor for the primary lens.Samsung’s really highlighting that it took a lot of engineering work to make the Galaxy S25 Edge a reality and that it didn’t have any shortcomings that would have dropped it from the mainline Galaxy S family of phones. Much of the May 12 Galaxy Unpacked will likely delve into how this device came to be.Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.(Image credit: Future/Lance Ulanoff)We still expect the Galaxy S25 Edge to arrive at a premium price, somewhere above $999 / £999 / AU$1,699. It should feature the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy inside, considering that’s powering the rest of the lineup. We also expect it to match 12GB of RAM, which should make it a speedy and efficient phone, but we also don’t yet know what size battery Samsung’s been able to squeeze inside the svelte frame.The latest rumors point to the Galaxy S25 Edge having a titanium frame, weighing only 163 grams, and only 5.85 millimeters thick. That same report claims the Galaxy S25 Edge will have a 6.7-inch AMOLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, which aligns with previous reports.The best news is that we’re just days away from this being official and Samsung telling us all about the Galaxy S25 Edge. It’s also the start of a new category of sorts – ultra-slim, premium smartphones for the masses, and Samsung will, in turn, be beating Apple to the punch before the much-rumored iPhone 17 Air sees the light of day.Now, if you’re already sold on the Galaxy S25 Edge – maybe you’ve been holding out on getting an S25, S25 Plus, or S25 Ultra – Samsung is rolling out an early offer. You can sign up to reserve the next Galaxy, with no commitment to purchasing or strings attached, and score a $50 Samsung Credit towards the S25 Edge.You might also likeThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge has just leaked in full – including specs, renders, and pricingExclusive: the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge will have durability to match its ‘sexy’ design\\nJacob Krol is the US Managing Editor, News for TechRadar.

And the world will have to be patient for at least a few more hours, as the cardinals in the conclave break for lunch and convene again for the next secret ballot.On Thursday morning, crowds gathered in St. Peter’s Square as the 133 cardinals voted in total secrecy. The black smoke prompted gasps and then groans from the crowds in St. Peter’s Square as they understood that no candidate had captured two-thirds of the cardinal electorate during voting in the morning. Pope Francis’ death in April set in motion the process of choosing his successor, the first conclave in more than a decade. The papal election is one of the world’s oldest dramas, but this one is unlike any other. It is the largest ever assembled, and many cardinals appointed by Francis are meeting one another for the first time.The new faces bring unfamiliar politics, priorities and concerns that some experts say could make the selection process more fragmented than usual. Francis also left the church deeply divided, with progressive factions pushing for more inclusion and change, and conservatives seeking to roll things back, often under the guise of preserving unity.Here’s what to know:How it works: Except for Wednesday, when there was only one vote, the cardinals will participate in four rounds of voting every day until a candidate achieves a two-thirds majority. The ballots are burned up to twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon, and smoke emitted from a purpose-built chimney above the Sistine Chapel signals the result — black smoke for no decision, white if there is a pope.How long it takes: There is no indication of how long the conclave will go, though the last two conclaves reached decisions within two days. One in the 13th century dragged on for almost three years.Extreme secrecy: Some security experts say the conclave is the most secure vote anywhere. The closed-door process, which is designed to be leakproof, has been fine-tuned over the centuries.Referendum on Francis: The election in many ways will turn on whether the cardinals want a pope who will follow Francis’ path of openness and inclusion or forge a different one. During his 12-year pontificate, Francis made landmark declarations that encouraged liberals, including allowing the blessing of people in same-sex unions and raising his voice for migrants.Here are 7 key issues dividing the Roman Catholic Church.ImageCardinals in Vatican City after the death of Pope Francis. A conclave to choose his successor is to start on Wednesday.Credit...James Hill for The New York TimesThe cardinals who are electing the next pope sometimes look as ideologically polarized as many secular voters around the globe. Many conservative Roman Catholic Church leaders disagreed with Pope Francis, who was often a darling of liberals around the world.But the typical divisions between progressives and conservatives don’t correspond so neatly with the ideological battles within the Vatican and the broader church. Complex debates are ongoing over the role of women and L.G.B.T.Q. Catholics in the church, whether priests should be able to marry, accountability for sexual abuse by priests and other divisive questions.More than any single issue, the choice of the next pontiff will be dominated by a philosophical question: Who deserves a say in determining the church’s future?AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTCardinals are supposed to pick up the voting this afternoon. They are set to have two more rounds of voting today, unless they elect a pope on the first. Interest in the ‘Conclave’ movie has soared. How accurate is it?ImageA scene from “Conclave,” a fictionalized account of the selection of a new pope.Credit...Focus Features, via Associated PressThe death of Pope Francis last month drove a surge of interest in the 2024 movie “Conclave,” a fictionalized account of the selection of a new pope.Streaming views rose 3,200 percent week-over-week, according to the tracking firm Luminate. When Amazon Prime Video made the film available at no extra cost to subscribers the day after the pope’s death, the number of minutes watched jumped to 18.3 million, from 574,000 a week earlier.The movie was “quite accurate, save for a few things,” said Kurt Martens, a professor of canon law at the Catholic University of America.ImageA scene from “Conclave.”Credit...Focus Features, via Associated PressBut, of course, not all the details of the process have leaked. “On some level, very few people outside the College of Cardinals can really speak to the reality” of what takes place, said Piotr H. Kosicki, an associate professor of history at the University of Maryland who focuses on Roman Catholicism.Here’s what happens in the film, and what papal experts say is accurate about its depiction of Vatican rituals.What’s ‘Conclave’ about?The film opens with the death of an unnamed fictional pope and follows the process and drama of a papal election.It stars Ralph Fiennes as Cardinal Thomas Lawrence, the dean of the College of Cardinals, with Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow, Lucian Msamati and Sergio Castellitto playing top papal contenders.The film follows the cardinals through several voting sessions, meals in a shared cafeteria and the rooms in the papal palace where they are sequestered.The emphasis on secrets and remaining insulated — the world conclave comes from the Latin for “with key” — has no doubt contributed to the interest in “Conclave,” which experts say does a reasonably good job of capturing this special moment in the workings of the Vatican.How much of the voting is shown?Many of the rituals in the film — the prayers being said, the burning of the ballots, a needle being woven through the ballots — are “more or less correct,” Dr. Kosicki said.During the voting process, each cardinal writes the name of one person on a rectangular ballot. Votes are announced aloud one by one, and each ballot is threaded with a single needle before being burned. Four rounds of voting are permitted daily.Some rituals depicted in the film take place in a mix of English and Spanish. In reality, Dr. Kosicki said, “prayer in the Vatican is in Italian or in Latin, period.”Is there as much cutthroat politicking in real life?While it is impossible to say exactly what goes on within the confines of the conclave, electing a pope is similar to electing a head of state, said Massimo Faggioli, a professor of history at Villanova University who specializes in the administrative inner workings of the Catholic Church and of the papacy.The politicking begins in earnest after the pope has died during what is called sede vacante, the period when the seat is vacant. But unlike in a standard governmental election, overt campaigning is taboo, Vatican experts say.Is it common for the cardinals to go multiple rounds without reaching a decision?The conclave process was created in the early Middle Ages to ensure that a new pope could be chosen quickly. The film “Conclave” depicts a pope being chosen over three days and seven ballots. In the last couple of centuries, conclaves haven’t lasted more than four days, Dr. Faggioli said. Pope Benedict XVI was elected in two days in 2005, as was Pope Francis in 2013.“Everyone likes it when things go fast because it means a show of unity,” Dr. Kosicki said. “And it means a strong sort of message being sent to the outside world, to the 1.4 billion Catholics.”After black smoke at noon, the crowd in St. Peter’s hopes for white smoke at night.ImageReacting as black smoke rises from the Sistine Chapel chimney on Thursday morning.Credit...Amanda Perobelli/ReutersAnticipation had been building in St. Peter’s Square on Thursday morning as people started to think in earnest that the cardinals would elect a new pope. But when the first smoke of the day came, just before noon, it was black — indicating that there was still no consensus inside the Sistine Chapel, where the cardinals were voting.Because the past two conclaves to elect Francis and Benedict XVI lasted two days, many of the faithful and tourists milling around the square as a light morning rain turned into bright sunshine said they expected white smoke on Thursday but not until the evening.So when the black smoke came at midday, most were not that surprised, training their cellphones on the giant screens flanking the square where they could see the smoke pumping out of the chimney.Judith Duru, 22, a nursing student in Rome from Nigeria, filmed the smoke on the screen because she could not see the actual smoke from where she was standing. She said she trusted the cardinals to select a “pope with a good heart, who can care for your people, understand your people.” Although she comes from a continent with a fast-growing Catholic population, she said she did not care where the new pope hailed from.“I don’t do politics and religion,” she said. “It does not matter to me” where he comes from, she added. “A good pope will touch everyone.”Before the first smoke signal of the day, Joaquín Cáceres, 30, and Lucía Pérez, 28, Argentines who live in Spain, said they had made a wager on Wednesday night after seeing the first plume of black smoke come out of the Sistine Chapel chimney.“He thinks this morning, on the third ballot,” Ms. Pérez said.“She thinks this afternoon, on the fifth ballot — like Francis,” Mr. Cáceres said.Although neither had a favorite contender, both said they hoped the cardinals would want to continue Francis’ work.“The conclave and the Holy Spirit always work in mysterious ways,” Ms. Pérez said. “But they don’t turn a deaf ear to what people say.”The crowd on Thursday morning was decidedly smaller than the many thousands of people who attended on Wednesday night, probably because a lot of Italians were at work, but perhaps also indicative of expectations that white smoke was more likely to come in the evening. The crowd remained heavily international on Thursday morning, with flags from across the world on view.Several onlookers said they planned to stick around all day — and came prepared.Philipp and Kathrin Wilmes, tourists from Germany, crammed their sightseeing into Monday and Tuesday so that they could wait for six hours in St. Peter’s Square on Wednesday to see the smoke. On Thursday, Mr. Wilmes, 45, had slathered his face with sunscreen expecting another long day. He and his wife, 39, had jackets, bread and water in their backpacks because they said they did not plan to move from their spot against the barrier closest to the basilica. The couple had tickets to fly back to Germany on Friday, and were hoping for an election before then.Maciej Czaharyn, 33, who is Polish but lives in Iceland, spent seven hours in the square on Wednesday. “I was standing all the time,” he said. “But it was worth the sacrifice.”On Thursday, Mr. Czaharyn brought a thin cushion to sit on the ground and a grocery bag filled with bottles of electrolyte drinks, chocolate cookies and cigarettes, “even though you can’t smoke in here,” he said.A group of sophomores from the University of Dallas, a Catholic school, had been studying near Marino, Italy, this year and extended their stay for the conclave. They sat in a circle on the ground playing a card game. They had a large bag of chocolate chip cookies and sandwich fixings.Some Italians found their way to St. Peter’s, too.Flavia Valle, 16, who was lying on the cobblestones not far from the barrier closest to the basilica, said that she and several friends were skipping high school.“I want to see the pope come out,” she said, pointing at the balcony framed by thick, red velvet curtains where the new pontiff traditionally makes a first appearance once the white smoke signals his election.She said she was hoping for another charismatic pope in the mode of Francis. “He talked to the guys, people my age,” she said. “I liked him.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTA call for ‘unity’ in the conclave sounds divisive to some.ImageCardinals returned to St. Peter’s Basilica after Pope Francis’ funeral in April.Credit...James Hill for The New York TimesEven before Pope Francis was entombed in a Rome basilica, conservative cardinals who felt his pontificate was a divisive disaster that endangered the church’s traditions had begun politicking to sway the conclave.They have a seductively simple slogan: unity.It is hard to imagine a less offensive rallying cry, but in the ears of Francis’ most committed supporters, it rings as a code word for rolling back Francis’ more inclusive vision of the Roman Catholic Church.The concerns are a clear sign of the maneuvering by ideological camps as the cardinals vote for Francis’ successor. Among the deeply contested issues are whether the next pope should push forward, or roll back, Francis’ openness to potentially ordaining women as deacons, making some married men clergy or offering communion to divorced and remarried Catholics.Some progressives within the church worry that the dozens of new cardinals Francis chose around the world will be less versed in Vaticanese and may be taken in by the sweetness of the unity siren.“It sounds really good,” said Cardinal Michael Czerny of Canada, who was one of Francis’ closest advisers, but “it means reversal.”“The black smoke is not surprising. The cardinals need some time to decide.”John Trecker, 39, a software engineer from Kansas City.Videotranscriptbars0:00/0:24-0:00transcriptI lost count, but I think the second or third black smoke is not surprising. The Cardinals need some time to decide. This is the most diverse set of cardinals, the biggest number in ever. And they don’t know each other. They need to understand the needs of the church now, and each other, before they can make a good decision. Yeah, but we’re here just to pray for them to make that decision.An Italian cardinal, Gianfranco Ravasi, who is 82 and not voting in the conclave, said that he had been impressed by a speech from Cardinal Jean-Marc Aveline of Marseille, France, who has emerged as a papal contender. Cardinal Aveline, who is learning Italian, read his speech in “perfect Italian,” Cardinal Ravasi said, adding, “He only got two accents wrong.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTWhile younger cardinals are busy choosing the new pope, older cardinals are mostly waiting it out like the rest of us (cardinals over age 80 are not allowed to vote). But many have attended meetings with the other, voting cardinals over the past two weeks, so they have thoughts about the next pontiff. The Vatican’s spokesman declined to say what time the voting began this morning, so it is hard to say how long it took the cardinals to cast their ballots in each vote.The black smoke suggests that three votes have now taken place, and a two-thirds majority has not been reached.VideoCreditCredit...Vatican Media, via ReutersAt first there was a gasp in the press room because the smoke looked a little white... but two seconds later, it was very clearly black.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHundreds of people in St. Peter’s Square raised their cell phones to the giant screens that showed the black smoke rising.

Here’s a glossary with some of the key words and phrases that are used in the process after a pope dies.A convent asks people to spiritually adopt a voting cardinal.ImageOn a convent’s website, people can pick a cardinal to support with prayer in the election of the pope.Credit...James Hill for The New York TimesA convent in a Northern Italian seaside city is encouraging people to pick a voting cardinal to accompany in prayer through its “Adopt a Cardinal” initiative.The convent, in Rimini in the Emilia-Romagna region, is calling on the faithful to pray for a cardinal to be guided by the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary in his choice for a new pope.People can sign up at a local church in Rimini or through the website of the convent, which houses a community of Poor Clares, also known as the Clarisses.The nuns have been clear that it is not a popularity contest. “We specify that this not a poll nor a Toto-Papa,” the website says, referring to the term for papal election predictions much used by Italian journalists. “We are not inviting people to choose the one who will become pope, but rather a cardinal to accompany with a special prayer in the election of the pope.”According to the site, all 133 cardinals have been adopted by at least one person. As of Thursday morning, 1,173 people had made a choice.No word on who has the most prayers.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTPeople are gathering in St. Peter’s Square to wait for the outcome of the next secret ballot.I just crossed the Tiber River on the Ponte Sant’Angelo.

The cardinals were scheduled to hold a Mass and prayers before heading to the Sistine Chapel for a second round of voting.With no result — and no smoke — expected imminently, St. Peter’s Square was almost deserted in the early morning, except for a few tourists and tour groups. But by 10 a.m., a crowd had started to gather. Few people looked up at the chimney of the Sistine Chapel — the focus of the Wednesday night’s anticipation.Lorena Belloso, 48, from Argentina and her husband were among the few in the square. “We came for a vacation to Spain and Italy, but we are Catholic believers and now we are waiting for the new pope,” she said. “It’s a historic moment.”On Wednesday evening, tens of thousands of people packed the square to wait for the outcome of the first ballot. A result had been expected early in the evening, but it wasn’t until 9 p.m. that black smoke rose from the chimney, signaling that the cardinals had not reached a consensus on a new pope. Applause, cheers and gasps of disappointment broke out among the crowd, which quickly vacated the square.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTStarting today, the cardinals will vote twice in the morning and twice in the afternoon. There will be smoke at the end of the morning session and the afternoon session, unless a pope is elected earlier.The cardinals were scheduled to hold a Mass and morning prayers at the Apostolic Palace early on Thursday before heading to the Sistine Chapel for a second round of voting.

No phones, no internet: The cardinals vote in extreme secrecy.ImageThe process of selecting a new pope, which takes place in the Sistine Chapel, is intended to be leakproof.Credit...Dimitar Dilkoff/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesNo cellphones. No internet. No television. No contact with the outside world. Welcome to the conclave, which some security experts say is the most secure vote anywhere.The ancient, closed-door selection process that began in the Sistine Chapel on Wednesday was intended to be leakproof. Popes have been fine-tuning the procedure for centuries.The last major changes to the rules came in 1996 and were laid out in a document written by Pope John Paul II, “Universi Dominici Gregis: On the Vacancy of the Apostolic See and the Election of the Roman Pontiff.”Before a single vote was cast on Wednesday, the chapel was cleared of all but the cardinal electors. (This time there are 133 of them.) The room was swept for listening and transmission devices. The windows were boarded up. Jamming devices are routinely used, to ensure that the proceedings cannot be interfered with, or snooped on.The participants all took an oath to uphold the sanctity — and, in essence, the security — of the vote. The process is almost entirely tech-free: Cardinals write their votes by hand on paper ballots, and then proceed one at a time to the altar to place their ballots in an urn.Nine cardinals oversee the process. Three are known as “scrutineers,” tasked with counting and recounting the votes and three are “revisers” who double-check their work.All of this creates “enormous social — religious, actually — disincentives to hacking the vote” or leaking details, Bruce Schneier, a security expert and lecturer at Harvard Kennedy School, wrote in a 2005 blog post.Twenty years later, with smartphones and recording devices nearly everywhere, Mr. Schneier reflected on the security of the voting. In an interview last week, he said that he still considered the conclave to be nearly hackproof. (On a scale of one to 10, with 10 being unhackable, Mr. Schneier gave it a 9.9.)“It’s a small manual process, which makes it more secure,” he added. But that also makes it nearly impossible to replicate for national elections. “There are no lessons for the real world,” he said, “because it doesn’t scale.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHow long will the conclave take?No one knows how long the conclave will last.There is no formal time limit: until two-thirds of the 133 voting Roman Catholic cardinals agree on a new pope, they must continue to vote. Past papal selections have lasted from just a few hours to nearly three years. In the 13th century, the tradition of sequestering the cardinals during the conclave started after residents in Viterbo, near Rome, where it was being held, grew frustrated with a selection process that dragged on almost three years. Locals locked the squabbling cardinals in the papal palace in Viterbo and had the roof removed, subjecting them to the elements. They also cut down their food rations until they made a selection. Pope Gregory X finally emerged as their choice after 33 months.It’s no wonder that Gregory X scrambled to come up with fixed rules for the conclave, which comes from the Latin “with key.” They included reducing meals to one a day if a pope was not elected after three days, and to only bread and water after five more days. But some papal elections continued to drag on. In the 17th and 18th centuries, European Catholic monarchies used their influence over loyal cardinals to shape the outcome, meaning that votes sometimes dragged on for months.Conclaves have become considerably shorter in the past two centuries, after the end of the pope’s temporal power in 1870.The last two popes, Francis and Benedict XVI, were each elected within two days.Cardinals provided varying estimates of how long this conclave would last. Some said the process may take longer than recent selections because the members of the large and diverse College of Cardinals, many of them appointed by Pope Francis in recent years, don’t know each other well. Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan of New York said he thought the conclave would be longer than the one that elected Francis. He has packed 12 packets of peanut butter, and enough to eat three a day. “I think it’ll be longer than last time,” he said.Others predict the cardinals will converge on a well-known name and wrap it up fast.“Everyone says that, but I don’t know how they know,” Cardinal Anders Arborelius of Sweden said in a recent interview. Maybe, he said, “Everyone wants to get home as soon as possible.” Elizabeth Dias contributed reporting.When will the cardinals vote next?ImagePeople watching a screen in St. Peter’s Square showing cardinals in the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican on Wednesday.Credit...Amanda Perobelli/ReutersVoting for the next pope will resume on Thursday morning and continue four times a day until a two-thirds majority reaches a consensus.The next vote by the 133 cardinals gathered in a conclave in Vatican City is expected to take place around 10:30 a.m. local time (4:30 a.m. Eastern), and the second around noon.If neither vote is successful, the next two ballots will take place around 5:30 p.m. and 7 p.m. on Thursday.Casting, reading and incinerating the secret ballots can take a while, so those times are only estimates.The voting procedure is precisely choreographed. All 133 voting cardinals must write the name of the man he sees as pope on a rectangular piece of paper under the phrase “Eligo in Summum Pontificem,” or “I elect as the supreme pontiff.” Cardinals individually walk their ballots to the chapel’s altar, where they say an oath in Latin, and leave the ballot on a plate.Votes are counted before being read aloud and pierced and tied together with a red string (the “Conclave” film depicted this practice). After ballots are counted, they are burned.Smoke emerges from the Sistine Chapel up to twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Black smoke tells the world that the cardinals haven’t reached a decision; white smoke announces that a new pope has been chosen.Both of the past two popes — Benedict XVI in 2005 and Francis in 2013 — were elected in two days. For the past two centuries, each pope was selected within four days or fewer.The cardinal electors will take Sunday off for prayer if a pope has not been selected by Saturday afternoon.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTPaper ballots and sacred oaths: the objects guiding the conclave.The conclave to elect the next pope is now underway at the Vatican. The cardinals — the prelates who are just below the pope in the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy — will vote by secret ballot for a successor to Pope Francis until one candidate earns a two-thirds majority.While we may not know what’s being said during the conclave — it is off limits to outsiders — we do have a pretty good idea what it will look like. During the gathering, the cardinals will follow specific instructions and use several distinctive objects to facilitate the process, many steeped in tradition.Here’s a look at some of those objects, and the meaning behind them.Voting InstrumentsWhen the cardinals vote in the Sistine Chapel, they will be sitting in rows of simple wooden tables. At one end of the chapel, a large table is set up for those who run the voting, according to the Universi Dominici Gregis, or U.D.G., one of the documents used to govern the papal transition.The room also contains voting instruments, including an urn to receive the ballots, a set of wooden balls, and a needle and twine. The urn is used to collect the ballots, rectangular pieces of paper printed with the Latin phrase “Eligo in Summum Pontificem” (“I elect as Supreme Pontiff”).The ballots contain a space where each cardinal writes in the name of his chosen candidate. The ballots are placed in the urn and are removed for counting after all the cardinals have voted.The wooden balls are used to keep track of the ballots. The balls have numbers written on them that correspond to the number of cardinals voting in the conclave. As the ballots are being counted, an attendant removes one of the wooden balls for each ballot, to ensure that the number matches the number of cardinals, according to The Catholic Advocate, formerly a newspaper of the Archdiocese of Newark, N.J. If the numbers don’t match, the ballots must be burned without being read and another vote is conducted immediately, according to the U.D.G.As the ballots are being read, they are pierced with the needle through the word “Eligo” and strung onto the thread, “so that the ballots can be more securely preserved,” according to the U.D.G.ImageMembers of the clergy and conclave staff taking the oath of secrecy in the Pauline Chapel earlier this week.Credit...The VaticanThe Oath of SecrecyThe conclave is a secretive institution, and many steps are taken to prevent leaks, including restricting the cardinals’ use of phones, the internet and newspapers.The members of the College of Cardinals, the body that will elect the pope, must also swear and sign an oath of secrecy, according to the U.D.G. The oath reads, in part: “I will observe absolute and perpetual secrecy with all who are not part of the College of Cardinal electors concerning all matters directly or indirectly related to the ballots cast and their scrutiny for the election of the Supreme Pontiff.”The cardinals also must promise not to record anything in Vatican City during the time of the election. The punishment for breaking the oath is “automatic” excommunication, according to the oath.ImageA temporary stove in the Sistine Chapel in a photo provided by the Vatican.Credit...The VaticanThe StoveThe weekend before the conclave began, Vatican workers installed a simple stove in which ballots would be burned in the Sistine Chapel. Fire crews also installed a chimney on the roof of the chapel, where the smoke will leave the building.After each round of voting, the ballots are mixed with chemicals that, when burned, emit either black or white smoke. Black smoke means that the cardinals have not yet reached the requisite majority; white smoke means that a new pope has been elected and voting is over.The SealAt the beginning of the conclave, the Apostolic Palace, which contains the Sistine Chapel, is closed to the public. On Wednesday, members of the Pontifical Swiss Guard placed beaded ropes with the guard’s seal at the entrances to the palace to ensure privacy and maintain secrecy for the cardinals.The Vatican City government also planned to deactivate cellphone service within its territory for the duration of the conclave, starting on Wednesday afternoon.The Papal VestmentsAfter a pope is elected, he is taken to the “Room of Tears,” a small room next to the Sistine Chapel, where he will put on the white papal cassock for the first time. Garments in three sizes are prepared and kept in the room, since no one knows who — or what size — the next pope will be.The room is known as the “Room of Tears” because there are accounts of previous popes becoming overwhelmed with emotion in the room, and being moved to tears, after their election. After the pope puts on the vestments, he is introduced to the public for the first time.', 'location': 'N/A', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Black smoke: No pope elected, conclave continues\\nENTITIES: Pope Francis, Cardinals, Vatican, Sistine Chapel\\nEVENT: Cardinals failed to elect a new pope on the second day of the conclave, indicated by black smoke.

He also noted that \"Teamsters are professional drivers who safely handle all conditions with miles driven in the real world.\"The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued a\\xa0Second Amended Standing General Order 2021-01 requiring manufacturers and operators of vehicles with automated driving systems (ADS) or level 2 advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to report crashes to the agency.This order mandates the reporting of specific crash-related information when ADS or level 2 ADAS is engaged or was recently in use, enabling NHTSA to monitor potential safety defects in these vehicles and ensure compliance with safety standards. The goal is to proactively address safety concerns related to these technologies as they evolve, in accordance with the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act. Driverless big rig robotruck (Aurora)What this means for the futureThere are undeniable upsides. Autonomous trucks could operate 24/7, slash delivery times, reduce costs and help address the growing driver shortage. They may even improve road safety by eliminating accidents caused by human error. But risks remain. Public trust in driverless tech is still shaky. Many worry about what happens to jobs when machines take the wheel. The Teamsters are particularly vocal about this.\"Tens of millions of people turn a key for a living, but companies like Aurora couldn\\'t care less if they lose their livelihoods. Eliminating all driving jobs would be disastrous for our communities and the middle class,\" McQuaid said.That said, a\\xa0Department of Transportation (DOT) study from the Trump administration projected long-haul autonomous trucking could increase U.S. employment by 26,400-35,100 jobs per year as new logistics and tech roles emerge. Aurora, for its part, claims both\\xa0human drivers and AVs are needed to meet demand.Still, consistent federal regulation is lacking.

The man who drove his car through Jennifer Aniston’s gates has been charged with stalking and vandalism. “Stalking is a crime that can quickly escalate from harassment to dangerous, violent actions, threatening the safety of victims and our communities,” District Attorney Nathan Hotchman said in a statement obtained by Variety. “My office is committed to aggressively prosecuting those who stalk and terrorize others, ensuring they are held accountable.” Along with one count of stalking and one of vandalism, Jimmy Wayne Carwyle faces an aggravating circumstance of the threat of great bodily harm, which would beef up his sentence if convicted. He faces three years in state prison.\\nOriginal story follows.\\nThe man who was arrested for allegedly driving a car through the gates outside Jennifer Aniston’s home in Los Angeles is now being investigated for possible stalking, law enforcement told TMZ. The Friends star was at home when the incident happened, and her security is said to have held 48-year-old Jimmy Wayne Carwyle at gunpoint until officers arrived and booked him on suspicion of felony vandalism. A public Facebook account under Carwyle’s name has previously made multiple disturbing posts about Aniston, including several that refer to her as his wife or soulmate. A September 2024 post addressed to Aniston declares in all caps, “I fucking love you, come get me or call me, tell me our address!, If not, I’m coming hunting next weekend!” The following month, another all-caps post suggests that there are forces of “corruption” keeping them apart.\\nCarwyle quit his job as an automobile-service technician five years ago and has since suffered from delusions that he is a Christlike figure who is married to Aniston, his childhood friend Steve Rhea claimed to NBC News on Tuesday. According to Rhea, Carwyle left his native Mississippi in September to start living out of his car at a Walmart in Burbank. “We just hope he gets the help he needs,” Rhea said. “I hope there’s some way to fix him, but I don’t know.” Carwyle, who has not been formally charged, is currently being held in the L.A.

Police say they are not looking for anyone else. One of the Gibson children caught in the Toowoomba fire Homicide detectives were called to assist in Queensland Police's investigation on Wednesday 'The 18 year old male and the 34 year old did assist with removing or assisting with the children getting from that premises,'\\xa0said Detective Superintendent George Marchesini on Thursday.'And I believe the 36 year old woman had escaped that house as well, was located towards the front of the premises.'We have detectives from the Darling Down district, along with the homicide investigation unit assisting this investigation.'We also brought in other specialist teams to assist, and some of that takes part with the forensic and scientific examination at the scene.\\xa0'As part of our investigation, we'll be looking at any interaction or communication from the family with police prior to this incident.'The two men were taken to a Toowoomba hospital with Mr Gibson in a stable condition with serious injuries while the teenager is believed to have a hand injury.They were discharged on Thursday morning. An 11-year-old boy was uninjured, police said.Det Supt Marchesini said they were still waiting to interview the mother about blaze.\\xa0'We have been unable to speak with the woman at this stage,'\\xa0he said.\\xa0 The home of Ellouisa Brighton Gibson, 36, (pictured) and partner Justin Gibson, 34, in Harristown, 130km west of Brisbane, erupted up in flames just after midnight on Wednesday 'That is something our investigators are working on with the hospital to arrange, but will happen dependent on her condition, how that progresses.'We're continually getting updates from the hospital at this stage - it's very difficult to ascertain.\\xa0We know she will have been hospital for an extensive period of time.\\xa0'We're just waiting on further confirmation of the hospital, and we'll be in contact with them quite regularly through the days.'He added: 'From what we've been advised at this point in time, she is in a critical condition, so has survived obviously last night and is expected to survive.\\xa0'But things can change quite quickly.Obviously we're hoping that she does, and that's not wanting to just be able to speak with her, but in terms of her surviving this incident.'Detective Inspector Renee Garske confirmed investigations would include whether domestic violence had played a role in the fire.Neighbours smashed windows in an attempt to free the children from the home.Neighbour Will Cuffe ran to help the family as soon as he saw the fire.‘We were awake and heard some loud shouting, so we went to see what was happening and saw a lot of people out on the street,’ he told The Courier Mail. Queensland Police confirmed it is treating the fire as suspicious ‘We heard the smoke alarms, then saw the smoke and flames. After we saw the smoke, it took about three minutes and the house just went up in flames‘We saw the mother, the father and some of the young kids. The mother was holding the kids and taking them to the ambulance.‘Two of the young kids were walking, but they were really badly burnt.’ he said. ‘The dad had a cut on his arm.’A witness who phoned Triple-0 said the home was fully engulfed by the time he ended the call to emergency services.Queensland Fire and Rescue Service station manager Neil Goodman said fire crews located the nine-year-old's body near the front door.'Once (crews) could bring the fire under control sufficiently, just near the front door, they located one (deceased person),' Mr Goodman told 7News.The family’s dog survived the fire and was being cared for by a neighbour.Mr Goodman said firefighters were greeted with a 'wall of flame and heavy smoke' when they arrived at the scene as the fire mostly impacted the front of the home.'The guys had quite a difficult time making access and getting in to conduct a primary search,' Mr Goodman said.After speaking with a family member who was 'hysterical', Mr Goodman advised fire and rescue crews on where they might be able to find the missing child.'We're all fathers, we've all got children, so its always hard, it's a little bit harder when its sort of similar to your own situation,' Mr Goodman said.It took about 30 minutes for four fire crews to extinguish the fire.Anyone with information or relevant vision, including CCTV or dashcam footage, is

costs, which appeared to have brought the Wagatha legal battle to an end more than five years after the viral social media post at the heart of the dispute, had brought “closure for my family and I”.Mrs Vardy sued Mrs Rooney at the High Court over alleged “very serious harm to her reputation” as a result of the latter’s October 2019 post, which claimed Mrs Vardy’s Instagram account was responsible for leaking information about her to The Sun newspaper.After a seven-day trial, Mrs Justice Steyn ruled in Mrs Rooney’s favour in July 2022, finding it was “likely” that Mrs Vardy’s agent, Caroline Watt, had passed information to The Sun and that Mrs Vardy “knew of and condoned this behaviour” and had “actively” engaged.The two were then engaged in a battle over legal costs for almost three years, potentially culminating on Tuesday when a specialist costs court was told that Mrs Vardy had agreed to pay almost £1.2 million of Mrs Rooney’s legal costs, with a judge also ruling she must pay an additional £212,000.Mrs Rooney must also pay Mrs Vardy a total of £135,097.50 in costs under the terms of court orders from 2024, which will be set off against what Mrs Vardy must pay.Posting on social media on Wednesday evening, Mrs Rooney wrote: “The ruling yesterday in my favour finally brings this claim to an end, it’s a relief and brings closure for my family and I.“Throughout this long process, I am grateful that the judgments have consistently gone my way.“However, as I have always maintained, this claim did not need to be made or run for as long as it did.“The time and money should have been put to better use.“I want to thank my legal representative, management, friends and family for their guidance and constant support.“Thanks also to the public and many well-wishers who have been in touch with such kind messages.“This episode is not something that I ever wanted in my life.“However, I am thankful for the way my family and team have dealt with it.“We look forward to moving on with our lives.”The case began in October 2019, when Mrs Rooney publicly claimed Mrs Vardy’s account was the source behind three stories featuring fake details she had posted on her private Instagram profile – her travelling to Mexico for a “gender selection” procedure, her planning to return to TV, and the basement flooding at her home.Mrs Rooney wrote: “I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them.“It’s … Rebekah Vardy’s account.”The case first went to court in November 2020, with a judge finding that Mrs Rooney’s post “clearly identified” Mrs Vardy as being “guilty of the serious and consistent breach of trust”.', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT',

But de-extinction remains a dangerous fantasy.Credit...Photo Illustration by Chantal JahchanBy Brooke JarvisBrooke Jarvis is a contributing writer for the magazine who writes frequently about climate change.May 7, 2025“Over 10,000 years ago, a howl was lost to time.”So begins a recent promotional video by Colossal Biosciences, a biotechnology company, whose narrator speaks in a voice that sounds as if it, too, was resurrected from the past: a 1950s newsreel or biology-class explainer. Quick cuts of scientific B-roll — frozen blood in vials, a microscope, a white-coated hand jiggling a computer joystick — eventually give way to a lingering close-up of a wolf opening a bright, golden eye. “Today,” the voice intones, “it returns.”The video introduces viewers to Romulus and Remus, “the first two dire wolves since the Pleistocene era.” In under three minutes, the very cute pups mature from tiny fluff balls, stumbling through their first steps, to regal youngsters romping in drifts of snow that accentuate their own (luxurious) white coats. “Roughhousing may look like play,” the narrator tells us, “but it’s serious practice for life in the pack.” The voice then shows a third, younger pup, Khaleesi — “the first female dire wolf brought back from extinction.”Colossal brands itself “the de-extinction company” and has announced plans to bring back woolly mammoths and dodos and Tasmanian tigers, some of the biggest stars in the species extermination hall of fame. On a planet with as many as one million species at risk of disappearing, many within decades, the company is promising an undo button.Many media outlets, including People and CNN, breathlessly promoted Colossal’s story; Time featured a cover portrait of Remus with a big red line through the word “extinct.” On my Facebook feed, clickbait link aggregators trumpeted “the world’s first de-extinction” in posts that were awe-struck and joyful. Any commenter who questioned the company’s narrative was shouted down as a hater. Amid the relentlessly grim news about the state of our planet, here was a tale of pure inspiration, of futuristic science triumphing over the tragic losses of a mythic past.De-extinction is a distinctly modern fantasy: the extremely appealing idea that we can, with just some pipettes and computers, undo the destruction we continue to cause the natural world. So it’s fitting that the first animal whose creation Colossal announced was a dire wolf — an animal that exists, in the public imagination, primarily as a fantasy. Colossal’s advisers include the “Game of Thrones” author George R.R. Martin and two stars of the HBO adaptation, and a press photo showed the animals sitting on the show’s Iron Throne. Many commenters were shocked not by the advancing science of genetic engineering but rather by the revelation that dire wolves were once real animals.Dire wolves thrived in the Americas for more than 200,000 years, adeptly filling so many ecological niches that their remains have been found from Alaska to Peru. More than 4,000 wolves were pulled from the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles alone. They are understood to have been hunters of the many large mammals that populated the Americas before the arrival of humans dramatically changed the continents’ ecology. They then disappeared alongside their prey, among the earliest victims of what would become an ongoing crisis of human-driven extinction.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

And that\\'s if warming continues under current policies to reach 4.9 degrees Fahrenheit (2.7 degrees Celsius) by 2100.If the world warms even faster, reaching 6.5 F (3.5\\u2009C) by 2100, 92% of today\\'s 5-year-olds will experience deadly heatwaves, 29% crop failures and 14% floods at some point in their lives.In comparison, the researchers found 16% of those born in 1960 experienced extreme heatwaves in their lifetimes. The researchers published their findings today (May 7) in the journal Nature.\"By stabilizing our climate around 1.5 C [2.7 F] above pre-industrial temperatures, about half of today\\'s young people will be exposed to an unprecedented number of heatwaves in their lifetime. Under a 3.5 C [6.5 F] scenario, over 90% will endure such exposure throughout their lives,\" study lead author Luke Grant, a physical scientist at the Canadian Centre for Climate Modeling and Analysis, said in a statement.\"The same picture emerges for other climate extremes examined, though with slightly lower affected fractions of the population. Yet the same unfair generational differences in unprecedented exposure is observed,\" he added.Eco-anxiety is rife among children, with nearly 4 in 5 children aged under 12 worried about climate change, according to a YouGov poll commissioned by Greenpeace.The effects of climate breakdown, and the human suffering it causes, are already evident — unprecedented heatwaves, storms, droughts, floods, extinctions and wildfires are taking place around the world.Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Related: Atlantic ocean currents are weakening — and it could make the climate in some regions unrecognizableBut quantifying the hardships that changes to Earth\\'s complex climactic systems will foist on future generations remains difficult. To arrive at a rough picture, the researchers behind the new study combed through demographic data for each location on the planet, combining population projections and life expectancies with climate model projections for three emissions scenarios.In February 2023, wildfires fueled by severe drought consumed forests, grasslands and wetlands in northeastern Argentina, burning an estimated 40% of the Ibera National Park. (Image credit: Joaquin Meabe/Getty Images)This enabled the researchers to arrive at rough estimates for the number of people in each generation who will experience unprecedented climate events. And the results they arrived at were stark — 52% of children born in 2020 face unprecedented heat exposure compared to 16% of those born in 1960 under the most limited global warming scenario of 2.7 F (1.5°C) by 2100, rising to 92% if warming reaches 6.5 F (3.5 °C).Exposures to crop failures, wildfires, droughts, floods and cyclones also rose significantly. For example, in a 6.5 F (3.5 °C) pathway 29% of those born in 2020 will face unprecedented lifetime exposure to crop failures, with the risk expanding for those around the United States, South America, Sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia.And those most socioeconomically vulnerable, especially children born around the tropics, are set to be the most strongly impacted. Under current policies, 92% of today’s five year olds born into low-income groups are exposed to lifetime risk compared to 79% of those from wealthier backgrounds.\"Living an unprecedented life means that without climate change, one would have less than a 1-in-10,000 chance of experiencing that many climate extremes across one\\'s lifetime,\" Grant said. \"This is a stringent threshold that identifies populations facing climate extremes far beyond what could be expected without man-made climate change.\"RELATED STORIESThe researchers note that their study is far from complete — they didn’t model climate change’s impacts on fertility, mortality or migration. This means that the effects of climate change in sparking mass migrations and resource wars were not accounted for in their analysis, and neither were the various tipping points our warming world is edging closer toward.In an accompanying News & Views article, Rosanna Gualdi and Raya Muttarak, from the Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Bologna, Italy, wrote that the findings \"reveal an alarming intergenerational gap\" in exposure to climate extremes.\"If greenhouse gases continue to be emitted into the atmosphere at current rates, global warming will intensify and today\\'s children will be exposed to increasingly frequent and severe climate-related hazards,\" they wrote.\"The actions taken today to reduce emissions are therefore crucial in shaping the climate future of current and coming generations. Given that the impacts of climate change and the transformations required to decarbonize society are not distributed equally, it is important to consider equity in the transition to net-zero emissions. This includes addressing the intergenerational inequality highlighted by Grant et al.

I mean this literally, as Leo J. Wahl is credited with inventing the modern hair clippers. The Wahl Professional 5 Star Cordless Senior Clipper keeps this legacy alive, which is why it’s a favorite among barbers. Chulpayev loves its unmatched power and durability, estimating that the clipper can handle around 50,000 total haircuts and last barbers at least five years. He also praises its ergonomic design for precise handling. Cassondra Kurtz, barber and founder of Beyond the Beard in New York City, also relies on the Senior Clipper for clients. This high-performance tool runs at 7,000 rpm, includes tough, long-lasting guards, offers an 80-minute cordless runtime, and can switch to corded use when needed. I’ve been using my Senior Clipper for over a year, and it’s clear why so many pros back it. The 7,000 rpm motor is no joke, plowing through hair with ease. I rarely, if ever, find myself going over one area multiple times. Plus, the adjustable taper is easy to use without sacrificing any stability (a common nuisance with clippers), so it’s perfect for any kind of fade, and you don’t have to worry about accidentally changing the length. The stainless steel blades never tug at hair and glide across your dome. A few months ago, I used these clippers to fully buzz my head, and the entire process couldn’t have taken more than ten minutes. That’s how powerful and precise these are. These are professional-grade clippers, so there are a few drawbacks for newbies. At 13 oz, the Senior is heavier than other options. Another killer Wahl device, the Magic Clip, is over 2 oz lighter, for example. DIY haircuts involve a lot of twisting and contorting your body to reach the sides and back of your head, so an extra couple of pounds will be felt. Similarly, if you’re new to cutting hair at home, these might prove too powerful and result in a more drastic cut than you were aiming for. But once you get the hang of using clippers, you won’t find a more reliable, effective option.Read More: Best Clippers for Men Battery Life80 minutesMotor Power7,000 rpmBladesStainless SteelAttachments4Most Versatile Cordless Hair Clipper Wahl Professional 5 Star Magic Clip ProsCan be used corded or cordlessGreat at beard trimmingLong lifespanSharp metal bladesComfortable to use designConsNot waterproofCharger isn't universe beyond Wahl productsIf you dig a fade, pay attention to the taper level on your cordless clipper. This lever actively adjusts the blade's cutting length between guide comb settings, allowing you to fine-tune the cut and achieve more precise fades. For the best available, look to Wahl’s Magic Clip, as its taper is even more user-friendly than the Senior. The lever not only switches between blade lengths more smoothly, but the feel of it (backed by its overall lighter design) is more comfortable and intuitive. Kurtz uses Wahl Professional 5 Star Cordless Senior on her clients, but recommends the Magic Clip for anyone new to cutting hair. This is due to the expansive dexterity and directional abilities the lightweight Magic Clip offers. Heavier clippers are going to be much more difficult to swing around your head, especially if you’re not very flexible, like me. They are also equipped with a consistently powerful battery that can operate for up to 100 minutes of runtime per charge. The high-power and high-speed motor also makes it versatile for a slew of hair types and styles. Plus, the blades are coated to keep them cooler for longer, and come with eight blade guard attachments for any hair length.Read More: Wahl Magic Clip Review Battery Life100 minutesMotor Power6,500 rpmBladesStainless SteelAttachments8Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowBest Cordless Hair Clipper DesignBaBylissPro BaBylissPRO GoldFX+ ProsBeautiful designStrong motorCan be used corded or cordless Three-hour battery ConsOver $225Chulpayev loves the BabylissPro for one major reason: its rpm. This clipper slices up to 13,600 slices per minute, and 6,800 rpm. Sure, the BaBylissPro GoldFX+ cordless hair clippers’ quality holds merit with its powerful motor and high-torque engine, but it also impresses with its sharp design. It has the vibe of a vintage ribbon microphone that Elvis would have used, but upside down, and gold. I’ll admit, I always feel a bit fancy whenever I hold this glittery clipper (despite chaotically cutting my own hair in a tiny bathroom). The battery life is also top of the market at three hours (though it’s more accurately 2 hours and 50 minutes), so I rarely have to charge it. I understand that dropping over $200 is a lot for something many people look to as a way to save money, but if you can swing it, these clippers will pay for themselves after a few uses.

There are swappable clipper and trimmer blades, a digital taper adjustment for razor-sharp precision, and magnetic snap-on guards for quick length changes. The full package is built for smooth, efficient cutting.While Bevel designed this tool with textured and curly hair in mind, it works on all hair types. I have straight hair, and this is my go-to when I’m giving myself a short cut, as it gets closer than any other clipper I’ve tried. Much of this is due to the digital taper, which unlike other traditional options, is controlled through an LED display, so that you always know exactly how closer you’re cutting. This results in a precise cut that’s easy to replicate once you find the taper levels you prefer. It also packs a standout four-hour battery life, which is far beyond any others on this list, and features a smart LED display so you’ll never run out of power mid-cut. It’s the ideal tool for fades and short hair styles, like buzzes or crew cuts.Battery Life4 hoursMotor Power6,000 rpmBladesStainless SteelAttachments4Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowBest Luxury Cordless Hair ClippersAndis Master Cordless Clipper 12470 Now 23% OffProsDurable aluminum housing Long lasting 2 hours batterySharp bladesIncludes standConsNo attachmentsLoud motorThe Andis Master Cordless Clipper runs at a powerful 7,200 strokes per minute with a rotary motor and a carbon-steel blade built for ultra-precise cuts.

I find it lasts more like 110 to 115 minutes. Still, it’s surprisingly lightweight for its power. The motor does get loud, especially during longer sessions.

It’s for the average dude who doesn’t want or have the space for multiple devices to achieve their grooming goals.The set comes with 21 pieces to tackle head hair, beards, body hair, and nose hair with interchangeable self-sharpening blades. Best of all, the battery lasts up to 6 hours. While it cannot operate with the cord, it does have a 5-minute quick charge.It won’t give you the most detailed cut, but if you’re just buzzing or doing a simple style, it can certainly handle that.

Chulpayev adds that corded hair clippers also tend to last longer. “If you took the corded machines that were made 30 or 20 years ago, you see some barbers that still use them,” he says. However, cordless devices like the Magic Clip, will only last about four or five years before performance starts to drop off. The benefits of cordless hair clippers are the convenience and flexibility of clipping your hair without dangling cables that restrict your movement. Cordless hair clippers also make for a better on-the-go option. “From a travel point of view, a personal point of view, and from a dexterity point of use, a cordless hair clipper is the way to go,” Kurtz says. While corded hair clippers offer abbreviated power, the best cordless hair clippers also offer consistent power for prolonged periods of time. Ultimately, like most grooming tools, it comes down to a split between preference and quality products. Meet the ExpertsDaniel Chulpayev, barber and founder of Made Man Barbershop in New York City.

That question is being hotly debated in Catholic forums, as millions of dollars pour into betting pools during an intensifying papal conclave.As digital wagering expands across the United States—once mainly focused on sports and casinos—betting platforms have broadened their reach to include the ongoing papal election. Picking the next Pope has become big business. Like, really big.Millions Riding on the Next PontiffWhile the College of Cardinals meets in secret behind Vatican walls to choose a new leader for 1.3 billion Catholics, punters around the globe are placing serious money on the outcome.Polymarket, a digital currency betting site, is handling over £13.47 million ($18 million) in wagers tied to the conclave. Meanwhile, Kalshi is managing close to £5.01 million ($6.7 million), according to the Wall Street Journal.Favourites and Long ShotsOn Polymarket, frontrunner Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's Secretary of State, leads with a 27% chance of selection. Close behind is Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle from the Philippines, holding a 22% likelihood.Other contenders include Cardinals Matteo Zuppi (11%), Pierbattista Pizzaballa (10%), and Peter Erdo (7%). On these platforms, users can 'buy' a candidate, effectively betting on their election as Pope, or 'sell' them—betting against their selection.Tagle's potential win has drawn over £0.97 million ($1.3 million) in bets, the same amount as Dutch Cardinal Willem 'Wim' Eijk, despite his 1% odds. Parolin, Cardinal Peter Turkson, and Cardinal Robert Sarah have each seen over £0.75 million ($1 million) wagered on their candidacies.Why Papal Elections Are So UnpredictableThe conclave's secrecy and lack of campaigning make betting on its outcome uniquely uncertain.Tom Nash, a contributing apologist for Catholic Answers, told Catholic News Agency: 'The most well-known cardinals are heading into the conclave,' but visibility doesn't always reflect actual chances of election.Nash noted that Cardinal Angelo Scola was widely tipped to win in 2013 but failed to secure the two-thirds majority. Instead, the Cardinals chose Jorge Bergoglio, who became Pope Francis.Even pre-conclave meetings are held privately, meaning the public has limited insight into real frontrunners.Strict Rules Inside the ConclaveThe 1996 apostolic constitution Universi Dominici Gregis forbids Cardinals from communicating outside the Vatican during the conclave. It also bans newspapers, radio, and TV access.The document explicitly outlaws any 'pact, agreement, promise, or other commitment' aimed at influencing the vote. However, it does permit open discussions and opinion sharing before and during deliberations.Morality of Betting on the Holy SeeSome Catholics have raised ethical concerns about gambling on such a solemn event. While once banned, betting on papal elections is no longer explicitly prohibited by Church law.In 1591, Pope Gregory XIV outlawed such betting under threat of excommunication. But the 1918 revision of canon law omitted the rule, and no ban has since been reinstated.Still, Nash cautioned: 'Catholics should prayerfully consider how we can best give witness regarding this 2025 conclave... betting could introduce [corruption] into the conclave.'He added: 'We don't want to reduce this important event to the level of a mere sports competition.'What the Church Says About GamblingThe Catechism of the Catholic Church does not condemn betting outright. Wagering is only deemed morally wrong when it involves money needed for essential expenses or becomes addictive.If you're gambling away rent money or falling into a cycle of dependency, the Church calls that 'enslavement'—a clear moral red flag.In short: placing a few pounds on your favourite cardinal isn't a sin.

That is, unless their thinking has been muddled by ingesting microplastics. Then, they struggle with a decision that could be crucial for survival. They aren’t alone: across the animal kingdom, it appears, tiny bits of plastic change behaviours and mess up cognition. Exposure to these particles makes mice more forgetful and less social. Bees have trouble learning. Zebrafish act more anxious.\\nSuch discoveries sound a warning bell for people, too. These so-called microplastic fragments are everywhere, from Arctic snow to the Amazon rainforest. Perhaps worse, they are in our foods: from beer and table salt to seafood and honey. “If you turn the top of your plastic bottle, you shower tiny pieces of plastic down into the water,” says Tamara Galloway, an ecotoxicologist at the University of Exeter, UK, whose work focuses on the environmental and health effects of pollultants like microplastics. People consume around 52,000 microplastic particles per year – or around 121,000 if you include those we inhale. What’s more, recent research shows that some of these can cross the barrier designed to stop toxins from getting from blood vessels into brain tissues.\\nExactly if and how this might mess with our minds is unclear because we can’t subject people to the sorts of experiments we do with the likes of mice – though Galloway’s opinion is that the effects on humans could be serious.\\nWe do however, have animal studies to illuminate how microplastics affect the brain…', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Microplastics linked to cognitive issues in animals\\nENTITIES: Marta Zaraska, Tamara Galloway, University of Exeter\\nEVENT: Animal studies show microplastics impair cognition and alter behavior in hermit crabs, mice, bees, and zebrafish; microplastics can cross the blood-brain barrier.\\nCONTEXT: Microplastics impact animal cognition, raising concerns for humans.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 47795, 'sourceId': 918, 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/may/07/queen-elizabeth-ii-memorial-designs-unveiled-statues-bridges-soundscapes', 'title': 'Statues, bridges, soundscapes: Queen Elizabeth II memorial designs unveiled', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T14:33:53.000Z', 'content': 'How best to capture the enduring essence of Queen Elizabeth II is the question behind innovative designs shortlisted for a national memorial planned for Britain’s longest-serving monarch.An exact cast of a Windsor oak tree, a giant canopy of stone lilies and a “graceful and strong” stone bridge symbolising her as the bedrock of the nation are among shortlisted designs on which the public is now being consulted.Other ideas include a statue of the late queen next to Prince Philip, an audio installation featuring her voice, and a “tranquil family” of romantic royal gardens inspired by the Georgian architect John Nash.The memorial is planned for St James’s Park, close to Buckingham Palace in the heart of London.

Firstly, there’s way more to do in bed than anal intercourse. Jerking off together, frotting, oral, making out, kink, and toys are all there at your disposal. You could, for example, acquire a double-ended dildo and experience the same kind of anal stimulation at the same time.\\nIf you simply need to integrate penis-in-ass anal play, you could enlist a third (or more) guy to do one/both of you. At first, it may make more sense to do this together, but of course, you could keep things open and both take partners separately. The writer Edmund White once told me that as a bottom, he tends to fall in love with other bottoms, and the way he’s always negotiated that is non-monogamy. An open relationship can function like the best of both worlds: You get the stability of a partner and the novelty of a swinging single. One person can’t be everything to you, no matter how perfect he is, so there’s a real pragmatism in keeping things open. It, of course, comes with its own complications like insecurity, jealousy, increased risk of infection, and time management, but if you stay on the same page with regular, clear communication and defer to the most sensitive person in the couple, you can do well and be extremely satisfied sexually.\\nFinally, I suggest thinking outside of your currently assumed identities. I know some people are just bottoms and that’s all they’re ever going to be sexually, but for many, those roles are a bit more malleable, subject to change with time and circumstance. Versatility is extremely common. If either of you has ever had an interest in topping, well, now is the time to try it. If it never goes there, you still have a lot of options.\\nPlease keep questions short (<150 words), and don‘t submit the same question to multiple columns.

In the event of something egregious—a wine glass shattered on a carpet, an accidental condom spillage across the wall—of course, the person responsible should try to rectify it as best they can (elbow grease, money to fix/clean/replace, both, etc.). But in terms of regular wear and tear from bodies being in a space doing what they’re there to do? Nah. That’s your job. Hosting includes prep and cleanup. You take on these responsibilities implicitly when you invite people into your home.\\nThat’s not to say that you’re being unreasonable. Of course, it would be nice if people lent a hand. Very considerate guests will at least offer to, say, do the dishes after you’ve cooked for them or stick around and help you pick up. But this is them going above and beyond—their job is to attend, and yours is to provide. It would not be outrageous if, in your invite, you mentioned, “Try to remain considerate. A helping hand from attendees in putting things back in order would be much appreciated.” Then maybe more people would be aware and make the effort. But they are not obligated to do so. That responsibility falls squarely on your shoulders. If you don’t like it, don’t throw a party. Generosity is, by definition, thankless—the gratitude you receive for your hospitality is a bonus, not part of the price of admission.\\nSend Us Your Questions About the Workplace!\\nThe columnists behind our new advice column,\\xa0Good Job, want to help you navigate your social dynamics at work. Does your colleague constantly bug you after hours? Has an ill-advised work romance gone awry?\\xa0Ask us your question here!\\nDear How to Do It,\\nMy girlfriend keeps complaining that I’m not performing oral sex on her properly because it takes her forever to reach orgasm. I’ve done this with previous girlfriends and never had any negative reactions. She orgasms pretty much every time we have sex, so she isn’t one of those women who has a difficult time coming.\\xa0Am I the one who has the problem, or is it her?\\n—First Time I’ve Heard This\\nDear First Time I’ve Heard This,\\nThe best way to think about this isn’t as a you problem or a her problem, but as a problem you both share. The licks ain’t licking, but whether that is your “fault” for not doing it right or her “fault” for not responding to supposedly objectively good head is immaterial—you should collaborate on a way to efficiently achieve your shared goal of her orgasm.\\nNow, I don’t think you should take your adeptness as a given. You say you hadn’t heard negative reactions about your performance from exes, but that only means that you didn’t hear the negative reactions, not that they didn’t exist. Positive reactions, too, may have been faked for any number of reasons (a glaring one: to get you to hurry up and be done). Your head game may have been very good indeed to the women that came before your current girlfriend, but I want to disabuse you of the notion that you’re intrinsically good at something when it may well not be the case and also is irrelevant if you aren’t good to the person that you are with. Everyone has different preferences, after all.\\nIt is unfortunate that your girlfriend seemingly hasn’t given you much direction. Complaining isn’t constructive. If your techniques are not suited to her taste, it would be useful for you to know what is. If you haven’t had this conversation, you should. Ask her what she likes and whether or not she can direct you in the moment. There is no all-purpose approach to prescribe to women’s genitalia. Bodies are idiosyncratic and each needs to be approached with stimulation catered to it—stimulation that in fact may need to change during the act. As Ian Kerner writes in She Comes First: The Thinking Man’s Guide to Pleasuring a Woman (a book that I recommend you and your girlfriend read and discuss together), “Cunnilingus is not foreplay, it’s coreplay—the best approach for consistently applying various methods of clitoral stimulation—and one that, like genital penetration, requires an appropriate prologue of erotic activity.”\\nKerner gives a lot of hands-on (or is that tongues-on?) advice in his book. The 69 position, he postulates, is not ideal because it provides “stimulation from the wrong point of attack,” which is to say: “Rather than approaching her vulva from the south—bottom up—you’re coming in from the north—top down. Regardless of who’s on top, you’ll have little use of your hands and it will be difficult to use your tongue to comfortably service the major parts of her clitoris.” For something that has proven effective, Kerner recommends diagonal tongue strokes (again, approaching from the south). Tilt your head so that one of your ears is pressing up against her inner thigh and lick from the lower point of the clit up to its diagonal opposite brushing against the head in the process, and then make slow strokes down. This is just one technique and tempo recommended—others may be more useful. You’ll have to try different things to see what works on your girlfriend’s body.

Earlier this year, the US government designated several crime factions as terrorist organizations, including Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua and El Salvador’s MS-13, as well as Mexican cartels and Haitian gangs.“We don’t have terrorist organizations here, we have criminal organizations that have infiltrated society,” said Sarrubo. But Brazilian law, he added, only considers organizations that violently clash with the government for religious or racial reasons to be terrorists.In recent weeks, the Trump administration has deported hundreds of Latin American immigrants, alleging they were gang members, though it presented little evidence of their criminal ties.At the meeting in Brasília, US officials informed their Brazilian counterparts that their request was part of an effort to address immigration and criminal gangs with a transnational presence, saying they were priorities for the Trump administration, said one source who was present.US officials said a terrorist designation could help the government apply sanctions, raise resources and target criminal supply chains, the same source added.According to this source, US officials said the FBI had reported that the PCC and the Comando Vermelho had cells in 12 US states, mainly Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Florida, Connecticut and Tennessee.Those reports, the source added, alleged that the gangs trafficked guns and laundered money through Brazilians who traveled to the US, adding that 113 people were denied visas to enter the country because of connections to organized crime in 2024 alone.On Monday, the office of Senator Flavio Bolsonaro, son of the former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, said he met with Trump Organization officials to deliver a dossier that he said included intelligence information that tied the PCC and the CV to terrorist acts.The US embassy in Brasília did not immediately reply to a request for comment.', 'location': 'BRA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Brazil rejects US request on gang designation\\nENTITIES: Brazil, US, Primeiro Comando da Capital, Comando Vermelho, Trump administration\\nEVENT: Brazil rejected a US request to designate PCC and CV gangs as terrorist organizations, citing Brazilian law.\\nCONTEXT: US wants Brazil to designate gangs as terrorists for sanctions.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 46930, 'sourceId': 883, 'url': 'https://news.sky.com/story/donald-trump-hails-uk-trade-deal-as-pm-agrees-concessions-on-food-and-agriculture-13363630', 'title': 'Donald Trump hails UK trade deal - as PM agrees concessions on food and agriculture', 'publishDate': '2025-05-08T02:00:00.000Z', 'content': 'Donald Trump has hailed the trade deal with the UK as \"full and comprehensive\" as he promised it would cement the relationship between the two countries for \"years to come\".The US president said it was a \"great honour\" to strike an agreement with the UK and said deals with other countries would soon follow.\\nPosting on the Truth Social website, Mr Trump said: \"The agreement with the United Kingdom is a full and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come.\"Because of our long time history and allegiance together, it is a great honour to have the United Kingdom as our FIRST announcement.

\"liberation day\" tariffs on both the US\\' geopolitical rivals and allies on 2 April.Mr Trump imposed a 10% tariff on most countries including the UK during the announcement, along with higher \"reciprocal\" tariff rates for many trading partners.However, those reciprocal tariffs were later suspended for 90 days.Britain was not among the countries hit with the higher reciprocal tariffs because it imports more from the US than it exports there.However, the UK was still impacted by a 25% tariff on all cars and all steel and aluminium imports to the US.A UK official said on Tuesday that the two countries had made good progress on a trade deal that would likely include lower tariff quotas on steel and cars.Read more:UK chancellor outlines red lines for US trade dealWill MPs get a

politically helpful for Keir Starmer to have got the heads of terms, the kind of main points of a US-UK trade deal, nailed down before we see what we have negotiated with the EU -- or, more importantly, Donald Trump sees what we have negotiated with the EU.\"Coates said there was \"always a danger\" that if it happened the other way around, Mr Trump would \"take umbrage\" at negotiations

This approach eliminates any added layers of software-based security – something the global telecom industry has struggled to achieve for years.\\nThe breakthrough – developed by Professor Lilin Yi at Shanghai Jiao Tong University – is called the Integrated Encryption and Communication (IEAC) system. Unlike traditional methods such as TLS or IPsec, which apply software-level security while leaving the optical signal exposed, IEAC redefines how security operates within fiber networks. Rather than securing the message, it encrypts the signal itself – the light – making eavesdropping virtually impossible.\\nIt achieves this using an optimized artificial intelligence technique called geometric constellation shaping (GCS). High-speed random number generators create a unique light pattern for each data burst. The system treats every transmission like a constantly shifting optical fingerprint. As a result, the signal becomes nearly impossible to decode without the exact matching pattern. To any interceptor, the data appears indistinguishable from static.\\nIn testing, the researchers passed the signal through a fiber loop, simulating conditions such as dispersion, nonlinearities, and optical noise. They tested it across 26 channels on the full 3.9 THz C-band, each carrying dual-polarization 32 GBd signals. The result was a net data rate of 1 Tbps and a bit error rate under 2×10⁻² – commercial-grade speed paired with near-military-grade security.\\nBeyond its blistering data rates, another compelling aspect of IEAC is its compatibility with existing infrastructure. Unlike quantum key distribution (QKD) or chaotic encryption systems that require specialized equipment, IEAC can piggyback on standard optical hardware. In many cases, deploying the system could be as simple as a firmware upgrade. This compatibility should provide a significant advantage for cash-strapped operators or countries seeking to secure national communications without overhauling their entire network.\\n\"Our work bridges the gap between security and transmission performance in optical communications,\" Yi said. \"By embedding encryption into the physical layer, IEAC paves the way for secure, high-throughput networks capable of supporting AI-driven data demands.\"\\nProfessor Yi and his team hope the IEAC framework\\'s scalability and compatibility with today\\'s optical infrastructure will make it a game changer for global data centers, cloud platforms, and upcoming 6G networks.', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: 1 Tbps secure data transmission achieved\\nENTITIES: Lilin Yi, Shanghai Jiao Tong University\\nEVENT: Chinese researchers achieved 1 Tbps secure data transmission over 1,200 km of optical fiber using Integrated Encryption and Communication (IEAC) system.\\nCONTEXT: IEAC is compatible with existing infrastructure, potentially deployable via firmware upgrade.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 48311, 'sourceId': 927, 'url': 'https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/locals-gather-red-wine-spritz-conclave-watch-cardinals-121585677', 'title': \"Locals gather for red wine spritz and conclave watch in a cardinal's hometown\", 'publishDate': '2025-05-08T06:14:30.000Z', 'content': 'SCHIAVON, Italy -- SCHIAVON, Italy (AP) — Conclave watching turned out to be a perfect aperitivo activity.Caffè Centrale, on the main drag of the Veneto hometown of Cardinal Pietro Parolin, a papal favorite, filled up with locals and journalists awaiting the first sign of smoke on Wednesday.A large TV screen displayed images from St. Peter’s Square and the chimney atop the Sistine Chapel, where 133 cardinals were casting the first votes for pope, as locals in the Veneto town of Schiavon, near Vicenza, quaffed glasses of wine.“We’re waiting, and we’re rooting for him,’’ said Giacomo Bonora, raising a glass of the local favorite, a red wine spritz, and using the local nickname for Parolin, “Don Piero.\" Bonora said that when Parolin returns to the town of 2,600, he asks to be called “Don Piero,\" the way a parish priest would be addressed, using the Veneto dialect for Pietro, rather than “eminence,\\'\\' a cardinal\\'s honorific.Parolin, 70, is a veteran diplomat who was Francis’ secretary of state, essentially the Holy See’s prime minister and No. 2 to the pope.Outside, a city worker stopped to show the parish sacristan a photo of Parolin when the town celebrated his elevation to secretary of state 12 years ago. Everyone is hopeful, but officials have been instructed not to speak to the media until a new pope is elected.Angelo Cisalto, the sacristan at the town\\'s St. Margherita parish church, was heading home to keep an eye on the smoke coming out of the chimney.If it is white, it is his job to go and ring the church bells. Cisalto, 84, remembers Parolin as a child, 14 years his junior, and always devout. “He used to dress up as an altar boy, and at home, in his garage, he had a little altar,’’ where he would play saying Mass, Cisalto recalled. “He is a very good, very humble person.\"Back at Caffè Centrale, clients ordered plates of cold cuts as the closed meeting of cardinals dragged on long past the expected hour. TV reporters whose air times had passed headed out for the night. Finally, black smoke emerged.“Tomorrow, we\\'ll do it again,” Bonora said. Locals recalled that Parolin came regularly to Schiavon before his mother died last summer. His father died when he was 10, and he entered the seminary in nearby Vicenza at 14.

The forest once brimmed with life, says Bashe Nuhem, a member of the Indigenous Qom community, but then came a road, and soon after that logging companies. “It was an invasion. Loggers came without any consultation and families moved away. Those that stayed were left with only a cemetery of trees,” she says.The Gran Chaco is South America’s second-largest forest after the Amazon; its 100m hectares (247m acres) stretch across Argentina, Paraguay, Brazil and Bolivia. It is also one of the richest areas of biodiversity in the world – host to more than 3,400 species of plants, 500 birds, 150 mammals, 120 reptiles and 100 amphibians.Jaguars are in decline in South America, with only 200 thought to be left in Argentina, and fewer than 20 in the Gran Chaco. Photograph: Rewilding Argentina Foundation/AFP/Getty ImagesBut as agricultural and logging industries have encroached on the territory, it has also become one of the most deforested places on Earth.About 7m hectares of native forests were lost in Argentina between 1998 and 2023, according to official data, about 80% of which was in the Gran Chaco. New figures from Greenpeace show that nearly 150,000 hectares (370,000 acres) were destroyed in the forest in 2024 – a 10% increase from the previous year.Strip after strip has been turned into farmland or burned, local people have been forced from their homes and wild animals are being caged in by fences. The only way to describe it, Greenpeace says, is a “forest emergency”. While the Amazon is afforded international scrutiny and publicity, environmentalists say the Gran Chaco is quietly disappearing.A truck laden with wood leaving the forest. Among the biggest issues facing animals are the loss of habitat and shelter. Photograph: Harriet BarberNatay Collet, a park ranger and technician, has witnessed the destruction first hand. “First they chop down the trees of value to sell, then they come for the rest with machines and chains. Afterwards, they set fire to the land, killing everything. All that is left is a desert,” she says.Collet says deforestation has happened since “the first colonists came” but that for the past 15 years “companies have come with everything they have”. “There is no hour of rest, it happens all hours, every day,” she says, adding that better technology and chainsaws have accelerated the process.Juan Diego Ayala, an environmental researcher and member of the collective Somos Monte, explains how much deforestation goes under the radar. “It’s called pinprick land grabs: instead of deforesting thousands of hectares at a time, they will take under 500 hectares at a time,” he says. “It is difficult to detect until it’s too late. It looks like nothing is happening, but everything is happening.”Changes in the ecosystem of the forest can have major implications for its inhabitants, such as the giant armadillo, an animal that is thought to breed only every three years. Photograph: AlamyThe Gran Chaco is home to a wide range of wildlife, including maned wolves, ocelots, tapirs, armadillos, capybaras and howler monkeys. With their habitat shrinking, many species are now at risk, biologists warn.“We have animals in immediate danger of being lost from these parks for ever, like the Chacoan peccary, the giant armadillo, the ocelot. But I think that today, given the current situation, all of the animals are in danger,” says Collet.The jaguar is one of the most vulnerable species, with conservationists estimating its range in Argentina has shrunk by more than 95% in the past 150 years. Officials believe there are only about 200 jaguars left in Argentina, and fewer than 20 in the Gran Chaco.Park ranger Natay Collet who has witnessed the impact of logging first-hand. Photograph: Harriet Barber“The loss of habitat is the biggest problem of all. The animals lose their shelter, their prey, they are forced to migrate,” says Alicia Delgado, a biologist at Rewilding Argentina. “When the land is no longer connected – when it is split by roads and farms – animals have to move through populated areas. People get scared and hunt them.”Collet explains that howler monkeys, which rarely leave the canopies, need tree connectivity to find resources and survive. She also worries about the giant armadillo, which is thought to breed only every three years. “A major change in the ecosystem can have a huge impact,” she says.Deforestation worsens the climate crisis, as carbon stored by trees is released back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. Nuhem says it has had a more immediate impact on the climate, too. “Now we have intense heat, the wind is stronger, the rainfall is scarce and the land is dry,” she says. Droughts have become longer, and floods more extreme, she adds.The felling of trees continues despite the creation of Argentina’s Forest Law in 2007, which was introduced in response to “the expansion of the agricultural frontier”. The state now requires provincial governments to decide which areas should be protected, set limits on deforestation and devote resources to conservation. But Hernán Giardini, coordinator of Greenpeace’s forest campaign, says, “the law is not enough, and our justice system is not working to defend the forest”.The deforestation also continues despite a 2019 ruling by the Chaco courts ordering its suspension.“Deforestation has been prohibited in Chaco since 2019 – the courts banned it, but it is never enforced,” says Enrique Viale, an environmental lawyer and president of the Argentine Association of Environmental Lawyers.Tree logs hidden behind bushes. Photograph: Harriet BarberA recently retired police officer tells the Guardian that once, when he was in the process of confiscating trucks filled with illegally cut trees, he received a call from a government official. “He told me to let the men – and the trees and trucks – go,” he says. “Whenever I tried to do the right thing, to stop the deforestation, I was punished, while those that committed the crimes walked free.”Nuhem says that local people attempting to prevent illegal deforestation have faced threats and violence for more than a decade.“We started filming what was happening, collecting information and talking about it on our community radio. But then people started calling up the station and threatening us. They said, ‘If you don’t stop, something will happen to you,’” Nuhem says.Bashé Nuhem, a member of the Qom community. Photograph: Harriet BarberIn 2008, one of Nuhem’s colleagues was kidnapped by a group of men.“They told her to stop reporting the deforestation, and that, if not, she would be killed. They beat her and raped her,” Nuhem says. “She left the group and the village. The case was never solved and a lot of people helping to report the deforestation fell silent.”Collet says illegal deforestation is treated with impunity because “the government sees Chaco as a resource to be used and exploited”. “The only thing the government sees in the forest is money,” she says.Some of the main products of the Chaco province are timber, soya beans, beef, cotton and tannins.The Chaco government did not respond to multiple requests for comment, but it has previously said it has seized bulldozers and suspended clearing permits to prevent illegal deforestation.In an interview last year, the governor of Chaco province, Leandro Zdero, said that the government “wants to preserve the forest … but we also want to stop being poor”.Viale says the state and businesses justify deforestation by saying it leads to economic development. “But Chaco is one of the provinces with the most deforestation in Argentina, and also one of the poorest,” he says. “Everyone mentions progress, but the bosses only enrich themselves.”Viale and his team have filed a criminal complaint about the deforestation, which is with Argentine prosecutors to investigate. “It is the first time in Chaco we have had a case of this magnitude,” Viale says. “We want to break the cycle of impunity.”The aftereffects: a deforested area near Las Lomitas, in Formosa, Argentina.

Analysis by the Guardian of data gathered for a new study showed that from 2019 to 2023, 282 trials involving only male subjects were submitted for regulatory approval in the UK – compared with 169 focused on women.Health inequality is a complex and multifaceted problem. There are massive socioeconomic differences\\xa0in life expectancy and infant mortality, as\\xa0well as race inequalities – for example, in maternity and mental illnesses. These and other disparities, along\\xa0with those relating to disability, can also be mapped geographically.Women, on average, live longer than men, so in this\\xa0sense men can be said to be disadvantaged. But in addition to the risks associated with pregnancy and\\xa0childbirth, far more women have dementia, while\\xa0survival rates from female- and male-specific cancers – and other diseases that affect the sexes differently – are highly variable.The five-year period in this study, which was carried out by the University of Liverpool and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), was not necessarily typical. It does not reveal how funding was divided up. But taking on board these caveats, it is hard to see a benign explanation for there being 67% more trials investigating men’s health than women’s. This gap in research inputs could reasonably be expected to contribute to a disparity in outcomes further down the line.This is all the more disappointing given recent progress in tackling women’s exclusion from health research. For decades, as Ms Criado Perez and others have documented, many clinical trials were conducted on male subjects only. Researchers preferred to avoid what they saw as complications associated with the female reproductive system, especially pregnancy – although experts now regard concerns that women’s hormones might skew results as having been wrong.Ninety per cent of the UK trials in the MHRA study involved both sexes. It is not possible to compare this precisely with past practice, as the data has not been scrutinised in the same way before. But increased recognition of the variable effects of medicines on males and females has led regulators and funders to change their policies. In the US, the National Institutes of Health has required investigators to consider sex as a variable since 2016. In the UK, the Medical Research Council changed its rules in 2022. Since then, experiments conducted on animals have been expected to include both sexes – with limited exceptions (such as when the condition being studied affects one sex only).The lack of medical research on pregnant women came to the fore during the pandemic, when many were unvaccinated and alarming numbers ended up in intensive care. Reluctance to test drugs on pregnant women is often linked to the thalidomide scandal of the 1960s, when thousands of babies were damaged by a drug given to their mothers for morning sickness. But while caution may be merited, among pregnant women themselves as well as researchers, there is no shortage of women who are not pregnant. The disparity in sex-specific research points to an anti-female bias.

The president has historically respected the independence of the central bank, and kept out of its way – even if there was disagreement over policy.But, of course, it looks like Trump is following his own playbook.“Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Trump said on social media in April.The Fed chair first took office in 2018 after an appointment from Trump, and was later reappointed by Joe Biden in 2022. Though his term is expected to end in May 2026, multiple reports suggested that Trump was considering firing the chair before his term is up.Here’s what we know is going on between Trump and the Federal Reserve.What does the Federal Reserve do?As the central bank, the Fed manages the money supply in the US, primarily by setting the interest rate. When setting it, the Fed considers the inflation rate and the labor market, what it calls its “dual mandate”: higher interest rates could bring down inflation, but negatively affect the labor market, while lower interest rates could do the opposite.Over the last few years, starting before Trump’s second term, the central bank has been trying to bring down inflation, which peaked at 9% in June 2022.To do that, the Fed raised interest rates to a multi-decade high of between 5.25% and 5.5%. Just a few years before, at the height of the pandemic, in 2020 and 2021, interest rates had been close to zero. This made it cheaper to borrow money, including taking out mortgages.Late last year, the Fed lowered interest rates, which are now 4.25% to 4.5% – a whole point lower than where they were a year ago.US stock markets are very sensitive to Fed decisions. Stocks started to climb after September, when the Fed started cutting rates.Why is Trump attacking the Federal Reserve?Since Trump took office again, Fed officials held three meetings, in January, March and May, at which they could have changed interest rates. At all three, they declined to touch the rates, citing economic uncertainty.“Uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further,” the Fed said on Wednesday, as it held rates again. In a statement, it added that its committee of policymakers “judges that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen”.After Trump introduced his newest slate of tariffs, he said on social media that he expected Powell to cut interest rates. “This would be a PERFECT time” for rate cuts, Trump wrote on social media. “CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS.”From Trump’s perspective, cutting rates could offset the impact that his tariffs are having on the US stock market. But for Fed officials, it would risk exacerbating inflation.Powell – who is extremely careful with his public remarks – made some statements that made clear the Fed believes Trump’s tariffs will make prices go up, making it far less likely that the central bank would decrease rates.“Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well-anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem,” he said in Chicago recently.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionThis seemed to set Trump off. “If I want him out, he’ll be out of there real fast, believe me,” the president told reporters in the Oval Office. “I’m not happy with him.”Can Trump legally fire the Fed chair?The clearest answer: right now, probably not, but things could change.Powell has affirmed that the Fed’s independence “is a matter of law”.“We’re not removable except for cause,” Powell said. “Fed independence has pretty broad support across both political parties and on both sides of the hill.”But he also mentioned a case going through the supreme court that may alter the power the president has over federal agencies, stemming from Trump firing an official with the National Labor Relations Board. It is unclear how the court will rule, but it allowed the firings to stand, overruling a lower court.“I don’t think that that decision will apply to the Fed, but I don’t know,” Powell said. “It’s a situation that we’re monitoring carefully.”The Fed’s next board meeting is on 17 and 18 June. Trump is likely to continue pressuring the Fed ahead of this meeting, but officials are not expected to budge.What is the Fed’s case for independence from the White House?The Fed, which holds huge power over the economy, has to be extremely careful about each decision it makes.Moves made by the central bank can affect the stock market, the value of the US dollar and government bonds – which all, in turn, affect the US economy.On the Fed’s independence, Powell said that officials “will only make our decisions based on our best thinking, based on our best analysis of the data and what is the way to achieve our dual mandate goals as we can to best serve the American people”.“We will do what we do strictly without consideration of political or any other extraneous factors,” he said.', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Trump clashes with Fed over interest rates\\nENTITIES: Donald Trump, Jerome Powell, Federal Reserve, Joe Biden\\nEVENT: Trump criticizes Fed Chair Powell for not cutting interest rates, potentially offsetting tariff impacts, while Powell emphasizes Fed's independence and inflation control.\\nCONTEXT: Trump pressures Fed amid economic uncertainty and tariff concerns.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 47806, 'sourceId': 918, 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/07/minimum-age-train-drivers-lowered-to-18-great-britain', 'title': 'Minimum age for train drivers to be lowered to 18 in Great Britain', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T04:00:07.000Z', 'content': 'If train drivers – like police officers – start looking younger, it may not just be you. Britain’s trains could soon have 18-year-olds in the cab, with the government likely to cut the minimum age to plug a shortage of drivers.Currently train drivers can obtain a licence from the age of 20 – although the vast majority of drivers are much older.The Department for Transport said the change could lead to teenage applicants being recruited from December. The government hopes to boost job prospects for young people, with thousands of apprenticeships made available to school-leavers, as well as making train services more reliable.According to data from the rail regulator ORR, 87% of P-coded cancellations – those made the night before a service is scheduled to run – are caused by driver shortages. Services are also frequently disrupted because of a reliance on “rest day working” across parts of the industry where operators rely on drivers voluntarily undertaking additional shifts.Unions and the rail industry also hope the move will lead to a more diverse workforce at the controls. Drivers are typically white middle-aged men, with an average age of 48. Fewer than 9% of train drivers are female, while under 12% are from a minority ethnic background.The move is also partly prompted by a looming retirement crisis: about 25%-30% of approximately 27,000 drivers in Britain are due to reach the retirement age of 65 in the next five years.The DfT said the decision to lower the recruitment age now would bridge this gap, preventing any future shortages and ensuring consistent, reliable services for passengers.The move comes after a consultation launched by the previous government, and as ministers plan wider reform under a nationalised Great British Railways.Heidi Alexander said the move would unlock thousands of jobs. The transport secretary said: “We’re committed to getting the economy moving and a big part of that is getting young people into the workforce, putting them on track for a skilled and fulfilling career which will boost growth across the country.“We’re future-proofing our railways against delays and cancellations caused by a shortage of drivers, ensuring that we can provide reliable, passenger-focused train journeys under Great British Railways for decades to come.”skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionMick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, the train drivers’ union, said it had long been campaigning to lower the age at which drivers could start training.

Lacking the means to keep them prisoner and afraid the soldiers would destroy Meymac as they had nearby Tulle just a few days earlier, the group decided to kill their captives.\\xa0Their remains, Reveil said, may still be buried on a wooded hill nearby.\\xa0Meymac’s mayor, who was at the meeting, knew nothing about the drama that had unfolded in his commune until Reveil made his confession back in 2019. Shortly after, he informed both the French National Office for Veterans and Victims of War (ONaCVG) and its German counterpart, the War Graves Commission (Volksbund).\\xa0After years spent verifying the veteran’s claims, waiting for the Covid-19 pandemic to pass and getting the green light from authorities, the search for the remains began\\xa0in August, 2023.\\xa0A ‘dignified’ burial\\xa0World War II ended 80 years ago but the remains of Germans are still being discovered today.A Dutch couple unearthed a Nazi helmet while digging for a water pipe on their property in Poland.

But when it comes to Germany, memory is in constant battle with the past, and the Volksbund\\'s activities can be a contentious issue.\\xa0Thorny questionsCritics of the Volksbund have argued that in providing proper burials to Wehrmacht soldiers, the commission indirectly puts their lives on equal footing with the victims of WWII. And even the former president of the organisation, Markus Meckel, acknowledged the complex nature of burying the remains of German soldiers in an\\xa0interview\\xa0with the New York Times.\\xa0“How do we mourn and remember these soldiers without honouring them?” he said.\\xa0The Volksbund\\'s activities have also become increasingly muddied with the rise of extremist parties across Europe. For the first time since WWII ended eight decades ago, a far-right party – the AfD – came in second during the German parliamentary elections on February 23,\\xa0doubling its votes\\xa0from 2021. The party is a fervent supporter of the Volksbund. Its leader, Alice Weidel, called on the German government\\xa0in October 2024\\xa0to provide more financial support to the organisation.The left in Germany has\\xa0criticised\\xa0the use of public funds for the Volksbund, calling it “intolerable”. In\\xa0response, the Volksbund insisted “war dead have a right to permanent rest”.\\xa0“There is a danger that the Volksbund becomes instrumentalised,” says Darren O’Byrne, a historian of modern Germany at Cambridge University. “Although it existed before the AfD, its interests align with those of the party, who are in favour of a more honourable treatment of Germany’s war dead.”\\xa0But O’Byrne, who lived in Germany for 12 years, says that the controversies around the organisation are “not much discussed” in the country and that the work they do is “quite respected”.\\xa0“[The Volksbund] carries out what would be perceived by many as a rather mundane task,” he explains. “There seems to be a broad political consensus among German parties, broadly speaking, of an appreciation of its work. The AfD is not the only party who wants to provide it with public funding.”\\xa0Read more\\'We\\'ll make it home together\\': A friendship between two deported women in Ravensbrück campHowever, the way German history is framed and remembered is also a broader, ongoing discussion in the country, especially in far-right circles. Senior figures of the AfD have\\xa0called for an end\\xa0of the country’s post-war repentance and dubbed the Holocaust memorial in Berlin a “memorial of shame”.\\xa0“Whether the [Volksbund] exists or not, it will have a very little role in the change in German memory culture,” says O’Byrne. “That is not to say that it doesn’t have a certain responsibility, though.”\\xa0“There is [also] a dissonance between the perceptions of the Volksbund from the outside and how it is treated inside Germany,” the historian explains. “In the Western historical consciousness, places like the US or UK, Nazism is\\xa0the\\xa0evil. It is literally north on the moral compass. So it does not come as a surprise that other countries are saying, ‘How can you be burying people who not only took part in, but largely drove the greatest human catastrophe in modern history?’”\\xa0“Does it come down to who deserves a burial?” O\\'Byrne asks. “It is a really complex question.”\\xa0The grey zones of remembrance\\xa0Lucien Tisserand was hired by the Volksbund to be the custodian of Normandy\\'s La Cambe German cemetery from 1991 to 2014. Beyond maintaining the grounds, he was also tasked with exhuming the remains of German soldiers killed during WWII. Tisserand recovered the remains of 200 bodies throughout his career.\\xa0“A lot of tips came to us a few decades after the war,” he told daily newspaper\\xa0Ouest France\\xa0in May of last year. “Many people knew [where German soldiers were buried], but said nothing. It was taboo.

Once the others in the group who had witnessed the killings with him had all died, he decided it was time – he did not want to take the secret with him to his grave.\\xa0“We felt ashamed, but did we have a choice?” Reveil told local newspaper La Vie Correzienne, who first\\xa0published his testimonial\\xa0in May 2023.\\xa0Once it was in the press, the story spread like wildfire. And in the lead-up to the search for remains that began in August 2023, Reveil\\'s critics said he had smeared the image of the French Resistance by talking about mass killings. He had tarnished the heroic image they had upheld since the end of the war.\\xa0“[Reveil] offered history. It seems his critics were interested in memory. They were interested in a version of history that was probably bound up in their identity,” says O’Byrne. “History and memory clash all the time.”\\xa0A search was carried out in Meymac in the 1960s, and 11 of the 47 bodies were excavated. The mission was abruptly stopped after five days, and\\xa0no one knows why. But the most agreed-upon hypothesis is that the Volksbund was facing intense anger from local memorial associations.\\xa0No remains were found following Reveil’s confession and the consequent search that took place in August that year. In October 2024, search efforts were given one “last chance”. The excavation lasted three days before being officially\\xa0shut down for good.\\xa0As time passes, those like Reveil who were alive during World War II and witnessed events first-hand are becoming fewer and farther between. \"Once the last victim, perpetrator or bystander dies, the Third Reich will cease to be a living memory.

In the United States it’s contracting,” said Dane Waters, chair of the Initiative and Referendum Institute at the University of Southern California, who has advised ballot campaigns in over 20 nations.Most of the new restrictions come from Republican lawmakers in states where petitions have been used to place abortion rights, marijuana legalization and other progressive initiatives on the ballot. GOP lawmakers contend their measures are shielding state constitutions from outside interests. “This is not a bill to restrict. It is a bill to protect — to make sure that our constitutional system is one of integrity, and that it’s free of fraud,” said state Sen. Jennifer Bradley of Florida, where the new initiative requirements already have been challenged in court. About half the U.S. states allow people to bypass their legislatures by gathering signatures to place proposed laws or constitutional amendments on the ballot. Since Oregon voters first used the process in 1904, a total of 2,744 citizen initiatives have appeared on statewide ballots, with 42% wining approval, according to the Initiative and Referendum Institute.But the process has long caused tension between voters and their elected representatives. Lawmakers often perceive the initiative process as “an assault on their power and authority, and they want to limit it,” Waters said. “They view it, in my opinion, as a nuisance – a gnat that keeps bothering them.” Because initiative petitions require thousands of signatures to qualify for the ballot, groups sponsoring them often pay people to solicit signatures outside shopping centers and public places. Some states now prohibit payments based on the number of signatures gathered. States also are trying to restrict who can circulate petitions. A new Arkansas law requires paid petition canvassers to live in the state. And a new Montana law will make petition circulators wear badges displaying their name and home state. The new Florida law expanding registration requirements for petition circulators also requires them to undergo state training and bars canvassers who are noncitizens, nonresidents or felons without their voting rights restored. In addition to providing their name, address and birth date, people signing initiative petitions in Florida also will have to provide either their Florida driver\\'s license, state identification card or the last four digits of their Social Security number. That information is not required in other states, said Kelly Hall, executive director of the Fairness Project, a progressive group that has backed dozens of ballot initiatives in states. Hall said people concerned about privacy might hesitate to sign petitions.“I work in ballot measures, and I deeply support many of the things that folks have tried to put on the ballot in Florida, ” Hall said, “and I don’t know if I could bring myself to do that – that’s a very prohibitive requirement.” Many states already prescribe a particular format for initiative petitions. South Dakota\\'s new mandate for specific font sizes was prompted by allegations that some people got duped into signing a petition for abortion rights last year, said sponsoring state Sen. Amber Hulse, a Republican. Printing the ballot title in large type “might make it harder for some issues to get on the ballot if people know what they’re signing. But that’s actually a good thing,\" Hulse said. Before they can collect signatures, petition sponsors must get approval from state officials. New measures in several states give those officials greater authority. New Arkansas laws allow the attorney general to reject initiatives written above an eighth-grade reading level or which conflict with the U.S. Constitution or federal law. Utah\\'s lieutenant governor, who already can reject unconstitutional petitions, now also will be able to turn away petitions that are unlikely to provide adequate funding for their proposed laws.A new Missouri law gives greater power to the secretary of state, instead of judges, to rewrite ballot summaries struck down as being insufficient or unfair. Most states require only a majority vote to amend their constitutions, though Colorado requires 55% approval and Florida 60%. Republican-led legislatures in North Dakota and South Dakota approved measures this year proposing a 60% public vote to approve future constitutional amendments, and Utah lawmakers backed a 60% threshold for tax measures. All three propositions still must go before voters, where they will need only a majority to pass. Voters rejected similar proposals in Ohio, Arkansas and South Dakota in recent years, but they approved a 60% threshold for tax measures in Arizona. Lawmakers contend the move has merit.“Raising the threshold can help protect the constitution from being manipulated by special interest groups or out-of-state activists,\" North Dakota House Majority Leader Mike Lefor said earlier this year.___Associated Press writers Jack Dura and Kate Payne contributed to this report.___ Payne is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Under the agreement announced Wednesday, Google will provide capital for the projects, which the companies say will each produce 600 megawatts of power capacity. No dollar figure for Google\\'s investment was given.“Our collaboration with Elementl Power enhances our ability to move at the speed required to meet this moment of AI and American innovation,\" said Amanda Peterson Corio, Google\\'s head of data center energy.Google and Elementl said they will collaborative with utility and regulated power companies to identify and advance new projects.“We look forward to working with Google to execute these projects and bring safe, carbon-free, baseload electricity to the grid,” said Elementl Power Chairman and CEO Chris Colbert.U.S. states have been positioning themselves to meet the tech industry’s power needs as policymakers consider expanding subsidies and gutting regulatory obstacles.Last year, 25 states passed legislation to support advanced nuclear energy, and lawmakers this year have introduced over 200 bills supportive of nuclear energy, according to the trade association Nuclear Energy Institute.Advanced reactor designs from competing firms are filling up the federal government’s regulatory pipeline as the industry touts them as a reliable, climate-friendly way to meet electricity demands from tech giants desperate to power their fast-growing artificial intelligence platforms.In October, Amazon announced that it was investing in small nuclear reactors, just two days after a similar announcement by Google. A month before that, Constellation Energy, the owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant said it it planned to restart the reactor so tech giant Microsoft could secure power to supply its data centers. Three Mile Island, located on the Susquehanna River just outside Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, was the site of the nation’s worst commercial nuclear power accident, in 1979.Amazon, Google and Microsoft also have been investing in solar and wind technologies, which make electricity without producing greenhouse gas emissions.Elementl Power was founded in 2022.', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Google invests in nuclear for AI power\\nENTITIES: Google, Elementl Power, Amazon, Microsoft, Constellation Energy\\nEVENT: Google partners with Elementl Power on three nuclear energy project sites to power AI, following similar investments by Amazon and Microsoft.\\nCONTEXT: AI power demands drive nuclear energy investments.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 48626, 'sourceId': 12433, 'url': 'https://www.livescience.com/health/diagnostic-dilemma-botched-penile-tattoo-left-man-with-permanent-semi-erection', 'title': 'Diagnostic dilemma: Botched penile tattoo left man with permanent semi-erection', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T10:00:00.000Z', 'content': 'A man got a tattoo from a person who used a handheld needle. This approach to tattooing isn\\'t uncommon, but in this case, the tattoo was botched and led to an unintended side effect.\\n(Image credit: Neuroplastic Creative via Getty Images)\\nThe patient: A 21-year-old man in IranThe symptoms: The patient reported that his penis had been \"partially rigid\" for three months.What happened next: Upon examining the man, doctors noted that he had a tattoo along the top of the penile shaft, as well as another tattoo on the glans, or tip of the penis. The man initially told the doctors he\\'d gotten the tattoos several years prior, but he later said he\\'d gotten them just before his symptoms emerged.The tattooist had used a handheld needle, the patient said, which is a common traditional tattooing technique. Afterward, the patient experienced bleeding and pain for a number of days. After the pain subsided, the man experienced \"longer-than-usual sleep-related erections,\" which worsened to the point that his penis was \"half-rigid\" all the time.His doctors further investigated his medical history and ran many lab tests, including brain scans to look for abnormalities and blood tests to rule out infections. Using sound waves to assess blood flow in the penis, the doctors saw \"pseudoaneurysms\" in the tattooed area, meaning there were places where the arteries had been injured, causing blood to pool.The diagnosis: The man was diagnosed with \"nonischemic priapism.\" Priapism refers to prolonged erections that occur in the absence of sexual stimulation, or that continue long after sexual stimulation has ceased.The most common form of priapism — ischemic priapism — occurs when a blockage prevents deoxygenated blood from exiting the penis, or when certain drugs prevent that blood flow. This can quickly lead to tissue damage, permanent scarring and impotence.Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.In nonischemic priapism, though, blood flow is not blocked, so there\\'s less pain and a low risk of permanent damage. This condition, also called \"high-flow priapism,\" typically occurs when an artery in the erectile tissue is injured and allows too much blood to be continuously pumped into the penis.The treatment: The appropriate treatment wasn\\'t available at the facility where the patient was examined, so he was referred to another facility for a superselective embolization, a procedure that would have blocked blood flow through the injured arteries to reduce blood flow in the penis. However, he instead underwent a \"nonindicated\" procedure that didn\\'t make sense given the features of his case. (In a report of the case, the man\\'s doctors didn\\'t note where or why he got this alternative operation.)The procedure involved introducing shunts, or passageways for blood, between two tissues: the corpus cavernosum and the corpus spongiosum. In ischemic priapism, blood builds up in the corpus cavernosum, so introducing these shunts helps the blood to drain properly. However, in nonischemic priapism, blood flow is not blocked, so that surgery wouldn\\'t help. \"Predictably, the procedure was unsuccessful,\" the man\\'s doctors wrote in the case report.Following the procedure, the man continued to experience half-rigid priapism. He was disappointed with the surgery\\'s outcome. But ultimately, the condition was painless and he maintained \"moderately good\" erectile function during intercourse. For those reasons, he declined further treatment and instead lives with the condition, his doctors reported.What makes the case unique: At the time the case was published, in 2012, the doctors wrote that it was the \"first case of nonischemic priapism following penile tattooing\" ever described in the medical literature.RELATED STORIESPriapism can have many triggers. For example, ischemic — or \"low-flow\" — priapism can be associated with sickle cell disease; blood cancers, such as leukemia; and the use of drugs, including certain antipsychotics, antidepressants and erectile-dysfunction medications. High-flow priapism accounts for only about 5% of priapism cases and is most often caused by physical trauma to the penis or the perineum, the tissue between the scrotum and anus.\"In our case, most probably, the handheld [tattoo] needle penetrated the penis too deep,\" the doctors wrote. \"Based on our unique case, we discourage penile tattooing.\"The patient, for his part, reported having no regret over the tattoo and no depression or other psychological symptoms related to the priapism.DisclaimerThis article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.\\nNicoletta Lanese is the health channel editor at Live Science and was previously a news editor and staff writer at the site.

Some of that material is human-made — satellites and space junk. Other material is rocky debris left over from collisions in the early solar system. These near-Earth objects (NEOs) can be a concern, so they are tracked to ensure they are not a threat to our planet.Related: Potentially hazardous asteroids: How many dangerous space rocks lurk near Earth — and can we stop them?In August 2024, astronomers in South Africa identified a new rock, known as 2024 PT5, traveling near Earth. 2024 PT5 was moving slowly, with a relative velocity of only 4.5 mph (2 meters per second), making it a strong target for the Mission Accessible Near-Earth Object Survey (MANOS). Only nine other asteroids have been seen traveling so slowly at their closest approach.Kareta, along with MANOS principal investigator Nick Moskovitz, also at Lowell, have been intrigued by the idea of finding moon rocks in space since just after the first such fragment was identified in 2021. MANOS is designed to hunt for and characterize the near-Earth asteroids that might be the easiest to visit with a spacecraft. According to Kareta, that meant the survey was ideal for looking at lunar castoffs. Within a week of 2024 PT5\\'s discovery, they had turned the Lowell Discovery Telescope in the space rock\\'s direction.Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Astronomers used the Two-meter Twin Telescope to capture this image of asteroid 2024 PT5 in November 2024. (Image credit: Two-Meter Twin Telescope / Light Bridges / Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias)After studying 2024 PT5 in both visible and near-infrared data, they concluded that it wasn\\'t an ordinary asteroid. Its composition proved similar to that of rocks carried back to Earth during the Apollo program, as well as one returned by the Soviet Union\\'s Luna 24. The researchers also found that 2024 PT5 was small — 26 to 39 feet (8 to 12 meters) in diameter.Kareta and his colleagues suspect that 2024 PT5 was excavated when something crashed into the moon. By studying the asteroid\\'s composition, they hope to tie the material back to its source and perhaps even identify its parent crater.Cratering events are one of the most important processes that shape planetary bodies without tectonics or liquids to remold them. But impacts can be affected by a variety of variables, and understanding them can be a challenge. Matching debris to its crater can provide another way to understand what happens when two bodies collide. That\\'s what makes identifying lunar rocks in space so intriguing.\"It\\'s like realizing a crime scene has a totally new kind of evidence you didn\\'t know you had before,\" Kareta told Space.com by email. \"It might not help you solve the crime right away, but considering the importance of the task, new details to compare are always welcome.\"Changing lanesMaterial from the Earth-moon system should be some of the easiest to fall into orbit near Earth. After an impactor collides with the moon, all but the fastest-moving material flung into space should continue traveling near our system. Although 2024 PT5 was dubbed a minimoon in September, it only briefly fell in line with the planet.Kareta compared it to two cars on the highway. Earth is blazing along in its own lane, while 2024 PT5 chugged along the interior path, closer to the sun. In 2024, the tiny chunk of rock changed lanes, falling into Earth\\'s path at roughly the same speed. By the end of September, it had moved on, shifting outward. Earth left it behind, but on the solar race track, the pair should be parallel again in 2055, scientists estimate.2024 PT5 is the second lunar fragment identified by researchers. Another small rock, Kamo\\'oalewa, was traced to the moon in 2021, five years after its discovery. That could hint at a new population, hidden in plain sight.Both objects are traveling in Earth-like orbits, but they don\\'t have much else in common. Kamo\\'oalewa is larger and appears to have been battered by cosmic rays, solar radiation and other processes longer than 2024 PT5 has. That might suggest it has been in space longer, Kareta said.Their orbits are also a bit different. Kamo\\'oalewa\\'s quasi-satellite orbit keeps it in Earth\\'s immediate vicinity for several consecutive orbits, even though it isn\\'t actually spinning around the planet. Unlike the lane-changing 2024 PT5, Kamo\\'oalewa is more like a car that stays one lane over, moving at roughly the same speed.Researchers are trying to match Kamo\\'oalewa to a crater. A recent study suggested that it could have come from a smashup that created Giordano Bruno crater, a 14-mile-wide (22 km) impact basin on the far side of the moon.The Giordano Bruno crater on the moon, the home of the asteroid Kamo\\'oalewa (Image credit: Nature Astronomy)Kareta is hopeful that more will be identified. While a single sample is an oddity, two could be part of a crowd. He suspects that some asteroids that have been identified as unusual may be lunar rocks in disguise.RELATED STORIESWhen the orbits of NEOs are calculated, their source region is often estimated based on their current travels. If some objects have been misclassified and their sources are incorrect, that could mean other aspects of their orbits are misunderstood. Although that could potentially increase the long-term chances of Earth being hit by an asteroid, Kareta said it is \"almost certainly not\" the case, \"but we\\'ll need to prove it.\"For now, Kareta and his colleagues will continue to use MANOS to search for other potential lunar fragments. He\\'s hopeful that the doubled population will convince other researchers to take a closer look, too. Upcoming large-scale surveys — like the Vera Rubin Observatory, a ground-based telescope expected to see first light this year — should also help to reveal other dim objects.The research was published in January in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.Originally posted on Space.com.\\nNola Taylor Tillman is a contributing writer for Live Science and Space.com.

We expect Google to talk about its latest innovations across all of its software and services, often with some sneak peeks at upcoming hardware.But this year, Google is also hosting a separate Android event, which it\\'s calling the Android Show: I/O Edition. The event will be prerecorded and take place exactly a week before the I/O keynote. We anticipate that it will focus closely on what we can expect from Android 16, Wear OS and other Android-related products.\\xa0By breaking out Android news into its own virtual event, Google frees itself to spend more time during the I/O keynote to talk about Gemini, Deep Mind, Android XR and Project Astra. It\\'s likely going to be a jam-packed series of events, so here\\'s how you can watch them both and what you can look forward to.Android Show: I/O Edition: Where to watchWhile the main I/O keynote isn\\'t until later in May, the company\\'s new Android Show is mere days away, taking place on May 13, 10 a.m. PDT (1 p.m. EDT, 6 p.m. BST). It\\'ll be livestreamed on the Android YouTube channel. It will focus heavily on Android 16, which has been in public beta for some time and is expected to launch officially in June. It\\'s earlier than Android usually rolls out; a driving force behind that move is to give developers more time with the early software to help optimize apps and software that focus on AI.\\xa0Rumored Android 16 features include updates to the camera for more fine-grain control over exposure and color temperature, more dynamic app resizing when using foldable phones and updates to the ways notifications are displayed. It\\'s possible Google may also talk about Android XR, the company\\'s latest foray into mixed-reality headsets in partnership with Samsung and its Project Moohan headset. We also expect announcements around Wear OS, Google\\'s software powering Android-based smartwatches. Android 16 may launch soon on the Pixel 9 Pro and other compatible Android devices. Andrew Lanxon/CNETGoogle I/O: Where to watchGoogle I/O proper kicks off with a keynote taking place on May 20, 10 a.m. PDT (1 p.m. EDT, 6 p.m. BST). It\\'ll almost certainly be available to stream online on Google\\'s own YouTube channel, although a holding video is yet to be available. There\\'s no live link on the I/O website yet, either, though you can use the handy links to add the event to your calendar of choice. Expect links to a livestream to be available closer to the day.What to expect from Google I/O 2025Google has talked less and less about Android at its I/O developer conference, with uses of the word \"Android\" falling far below the 124 times the word \"AI\" was spoken on stage during the 2024 keynote. Given that Google is spinning its Android announcements into its own event, it\\'s safe to expect that Android will continue to take a back seat. Samsung\\'s Project Moohan may get an outing during I/O or the Android Show. Tara Brown/CNETAI will definitely dominate the conversation at this year\\'s I/O. From its integration into Android to the always-seeing\\xa0Project Astra, AI tools will continue to be infused deeper into everything that Google does, whether you like it or not.

This latest model can run Apple Intelligence, comes in a new selection of colors, and works with the Apple Pencil Pro. Best of all, Apple upped the storage, so you get twice as much for your money.\\nWith the arrival of a new iPad mini, Apple stopped selling the older model, although you may find it in Apple’s Refurbished Store (US) or Apple’s Refurbished Store (UK). Beyond Apple, resellers are likely to keep selling the older (2021, 6th-gen) iPad mini for a while, and you can expect to see some discounts as they clear out their old stock. Just note that at the entry level these older models had half the storage of the newer ones.\\nRead on for the best places to pick up the 2024 iPad mini (A17 Pro) or the 6th-gen iPad mini at the best price in the U.S. or U.K.\\nIf you’re after a larger display we also have the best deals on the 10th-gen iPad, the best iPad Air deals, and the best iPad Pro deals.

But when she finally sat down to write her statement, Wales was stuck. She struggled to find the right words, but one voice was clear: her brother\\'s. \"I couldn\\'t help hear his voice in my head of what he would say,\" Wales told NPR. That\\'s when the idea came to her: to use artificial intelligence to generate a video of how her late brother, Christopher Pelkey, would address the courtroom and specifically the man who fatally shot him at a red light in 2021.\\nOn Thursday, Wales stood before the court and played the video — in what AI experts say is likely the first time the technology has been used in the U.S. to create an impact statement read by an AI rendering of the deceased victim.\\nA sister looking for the right words Wales has been thinking about her victim impact statement since the initial trial in 2023. The case was retried in 2025 because of procedural problems with the first trial. The chance to speak in court meant a great deal to Wales, who held back her emotions throughout both trials to avoid influencing the jury. \"You\\'re told that you cannot react, you cannot emote, you cannot cry,\" she said. \\u200a\"We looked forward to [sentencing] because we finally were gonna be able to react.\" Wales\\' attorney told her to humanize Pelkey and offer a complete picture of who he was. So Wales went on a mission. She said she contacted as many people from Pelkey\\'s life — from his elementary school teacher to high school prom date to the soldiers he served alongside in Iraq and Afghanistan.\\nA photo of Christopher Pelkey walking his sister Stacey Wales down the aisle at her wedding.\\nA photo of Chris Pelkey walking his sister Stacey Wales down the aisle at her wedding./Stacey Wales\\nhide caption\\ntoggle caption\\nA photo of Chris Pelkey walking his sister Stacey Wales down the aisle at her wedding./Stacey Wales\\nIn total, Wales gathered 48 victim impact statements — not counting her own. When it was time to write hers, she was torn between saying how she truly felt and what she thought the judge would want to hear. \"I didn\\'t wanna get up there and say, \\'I forgive you,\\' \\'cause I don\\'t, I\\'m not there yet,\" she said. \"And the dichotomy was that I could hear Chris\\' voice in my head and he\\'s like, \\'I forgive him.\\'\" Pelkey\\'s mantra had always been to love God and love others, according to Wales. He was the kind of man who would give the shirt off his back, she said. While she struggled to find the right words for herself, Wales said writing from his perspective came naturally.\\n\"I knew what he stood for and it was just very clear to me what he would say,\" she added. A digitally trimmed beard and an inserted laugh That night, Wales turned to her husband Tim, who has experience using AI for work. \"He doesn\\'t get a say. He doesn\\'t get a chance to speak,\" Wales said, referring to her brother. \"We can\\'t let that happen. We have to give him a voice.\" Tim and their business partner Scott Yentzer had only a few days to produce the video. The challenge: there\\'s no single program built for a project like this. They also needed a long, clear audio clip of Pelkey\\'s voice and a photo of him looking straight to the camera — neither of which Wales had. Still, using several AI tools, Wales\\' husband and Yentzer managed to create a convincing video using about a 4.5-minute-video of Pelkey, his funeral photo and a script that Wales prepared. They digitally removed the sunglasses on top of Pelkey\\'s hat and trimmed his beard — which had been causing technological issues.\\nWales, who was heavily involved in making sure the video felt true to life, said recreating her brother\\'s laugh was especially tough because most clips of Pelkey were filled with background noise. The experience made Wales reflect on her own mortality. So one evening, Wales stepped into her closest and recorded a nine-minute-video of herself talking and laughing — just in case her family ever needs clear audio of her voice someday. \"It was a weird out-of-body experience to think that way about your own mortality, but you never know when you\\'re going to not be here,\" she said. The night before the sentencing hearing, Wales called her victim rights attorney, Jessica Gattuso, to tell her about the video. Gattuso told NPR that she was initially hesitant about the idea because she had never heard of it being done before in Arizona court. She was also worried that the video may not be received well. But after seeing the video, she felt compelled that it should be viewed in court.\\n\"I knew it would have an impact on everyone including the shooter, because it was a message of forgiveness,\" Gattuso said. The AI generated video helped with healing, sister says Ten people spoke in support of Pelkey at the sentencing hearing. The AI-generated video of him went last. \\u200a\"Hello. Just to be clear for everyone seeing this, I\\'m a version of Chris Pelkey recreated through AI that uses my picture and my voice profile,\" the AI avatar said. The video went on to thank everyone in Pelkey\\'s life who contributed an impact statement and attended the hearing. Then, the video addressed his shooter, Gabriel Paul Horcasitas. \"It is a shame we encountered each other that day in those circumstances. In another life, we probably could have been friends. I believe in forgiveness and in God who forgives. I always have and I still do,\" the video said. The video ended with the avatar encouraging everyone to love one another and live life to the fullest. \"Well, I\\'m gonna go fishing now. Love you all. See you on the other side,\" it concluded. Neither the defense nor the judge pushed back. Later in the hearing, Judge Todd Lang said, \"I loved that AI. Thank you for that.\"\\nA photo of Christopher Pelkey.\\nStacey Wales\\nhide caption\\ntoggle caption\\nStacey Wales\\nHe added, \"It says something about the family because you told me how angry you were and you demanded the maximum sentence. And even thought that\\'s what you wanted, you allowed Chris to speak from his heart, as you saw it. I didn\\'t hear him asking for the maximum sentence.\" Horcasitas received 10.5 years for manslaughter. Wales said she didn\\'t realize how deeply the video would affect her and her family. For her teenage son, it was a chance to hear his uncle say goodbye. For Wales, it gave her the strength to finally look back at photos of her brother.\\n\"Going through this process of AI and what he\\'d sound like and trimming his beard and inserting laughs and all these other things, it was very cathartic and it was part of the healing process,\" she said. What AI and legal experts say Over the years, there have been a growing number of examples testing the bounds of AI\\'s role in the courtroom. For instance, in 2023, President Trump\\'s former lawyer Michael Cohen unwittingly sent his attorney bogus AI-generated legal citations. More recently, last month, a man attempted to use an AI-generated lawyer avatar in court — an effort that was quickly shut down by the judge. But the use of AI for a victim impact statement appears novel, according to Maura Grossman, a professor at the University of Waterloo who has studied the applications of AI in criminal and civil cases. She added, that she did not see any major legal or ethical issues in Pelkey\\'s case. \"Because this is in front of a judge, not a jury, and because the video wasn\\'t submitted as evidence per se, its impact is more limited,\" she told NPR via email.\\nSome experts, including Grossman, predict generative AI will become more common in the legal system, but it raises various legal and ethical questions. When it comes to victim impact statements, key concerns include questions around consent, fairness and whether the content was made in good faith. \"Victim statements like this that truly try to represent the dead victim\\'s voice are probably the least objectionable use of AI to create false videos or statements,\" Gary Marchant, a professor of law, ethics and emerging technologies at Arizona State University\\'s Sandra Day O\\'Connor College of Law, wrote in an email. \"Many attempts to use AI to create deep fakes will be much more malevolent,\" he added.\\nWales herself cautions people who may follow in her footsteps to act with integrity and not be driven by selfish motives. \"I could have been very selfish with it,\" she said. \"But it was important not to give any one person or group closure that could leave somebody else out.\"', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: AI recreates victim for court statement\\nENTITIES: Christopher Pelkey, Stacey Wales, Gabriel Paul Horcasitas, Judge Todd Lang\\nEVENT: Sister used AI to create video of deceased brother addressing his killer in court.\\nCONTEXT: AI used in court for victim impact statement.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 49495, 'sourceId': 12506, 'url': 'https://www.techradar.com/vehicle-tech/hybrid-electric-vehicles/forget-foldable-phones-lgs-stretchable-in-car-display-can-grow-physical-buttons-when-you-need-them-and-i-cant-stop-watching-it', 'title': \"Forget foldable phones &ndash;&nbsp;LG's 'stretchable' in-car display can grow physical buttons when you need them, and I can't&hellip;\", 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T16:38:07.000Z', 'content': '(Image credit: LG)\\nLG’s innovative display has been designed for automotive useCompany says a display and buttons can merge seamlessly into oneThe tech is just a concept, but we could see it in cars soonThe argument surrounding physical buttons in modern vehicles continues to rage, with some vocal sectors (arguably led by journalists) calling for a reduction in potentially distracting touchscreens and more easily locatable switches when driving.But LG may have come up with an intriguing solution, as it\\'s revealed a Stretchable automotive display ahead of SID Display Week in California – arguably the CES of the screen world.The company says that its unique display, which sees a curved touchscreen miraculously come to life with a physical dial and buttons, has been designed to turn every interior space into a display… but one with physical buttons built into it.There’s scant information about the inner workings of the innovation, but LG claims the display can expand by up to 50% while maintaining a high resolution of 100 ppi (pixels per inch) and full RGB color, comparable to that of a standard monitor.In a video demo (below), the company shows how a dial rises out of the touchscreen surface when activated, allowing the user to increase or decrease volume or other settings with a twirl of a finger.(Image credit: LG)Similarly, a further two buttons rise out of the display below the main dial, which allow the user to more easily navigate menu screens.LG points out that a conventional automotive fascia requires a separate automotive display and physical buttons, whereas this doesn\\'t. Although it seems to have ignored the fact that many automakers tend to remove the physical buttons entirely, anyway.Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.As a result, LG thinks its expandable display, complete with protruding touch buttons, offers the best of both worlds that is \"easy to operate even while driving\".Alongside the Stretchable display, the South Korean tech giant is also showcasing the world’s largest pillar-to-pillar 57-inch automotive display, as well as an 18-inch Slidable OLED display that can be rolled up and hidden in a vehicle’s interior headliner.Analysis: One touch too many(Image credit: LG)While LG’s display technology is mightily impressive, looking like something hailing directly from an alien aircraft, it doesn’t really solve the issue of driver distraction when behind the wheel.The beauty of physical buttons is that they remain static, easy to locate and the sort of thing drivers can operate with muscle memory alone, negating the need to take eyes off the road.LG’s demonstration reveals that the unit has to be tapped a number of times before the physical buttons appear, often via very small and possibly quite fiddly parts of the screen.It’s almost like a futuristic BMW iDrive system, but with additional steps required to reveal the physical dials and buttons that made the German marque’s system so easy to use... although the new version has controversially dispatched of buttons.While a stretchable display might not be the best solution for drivers, it could be an ultra-luxurious system for those traveling in the rear – allowing designers the freedom to keep spaces looking clean and minimal, while offering a bit of drama when occupants decide they want to enjoy some Netflix on the 18-inch Slidable OLED display that’s tucked away in the roof.You might also likeMercedes\\' new steer-by-wire tech is the next big EV trend – and I\\'ll begrudgingly accept that it\\'s the futureI’ve tried the new Mercedes-Benz Superscreen – and its Google Gemini-powered smarts push EV infotainment to the next levelMove over, Rolls Royce – I tried the BMW i7\\'s 31-inch 8K Theater Screen and it\\'s the height of automotive luxury\\nLeon has been navigating a world where automotive and tech collide for almost 20 years, reporting on everything from in-car entertainment to robotised manufacturing plants.

This contrasts with the tiered and often unpredictable pricing models used by competitors.Takes aim at AWS with a bold alternativeThe service is available immediately to customers with multi-petabyte workloads. It complements Backblaze’s existing B2 cloud storage tier, priced at $6 per terabyte per month.That basic tier includes features like object lock immutability and a 99.9% uptime SLA and is often listed among the best cloud backup services for small businesses or individual users.B2 Overdrive, by contrast, is aimed at organizations working at scale. According to Backblaze, it delivers 100% performance at roughly one-fifth the cost of AWS S3 and includes free egress up to three times the average monthly storage amount, with additional egress priced at $0.01 per GB.The tier is built on disk-based infrastructure and connects directly to customer environments via secure private networking. It enables data to move freely to GPU clouds or high-performance compute clusters without incurring egress charges.Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!Backblaze says B2 Overdrive is intended for use cases such as AI and machine learning training, inference, large-scale analytics, media processing, and research computing.Unlike most public cloud storage providers that emphasize latency, Backblaze focuses on sustained throughput.Among major US providers - AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, and Oracle - Backblaze is the only one to publish throughput numbers directly.Though not a general-purpose solution, B2 Overdrive may appeal to businesses seeking performance and pricing transparency.While not commonly used for photo management, its affordability and expandable storage could make it a contender for archival photo storage as well.“With B2 Overdrive, we’re challenging the industry’s assumption that organizations must pay colossal prices for colossal performance. We’ve engineered a solution that delivers the sustained high-throughput organizations need, without the egress fees and complex pricing tiers that are pervasive among legacy providers,” said Backblaze CEO Gleb Budman.Via BlocksandfilesYou might also likeTake a look at our roundup of the\\xa0best business VPNs\\xa0available nowThese are the\\xa0best cloud document storage\\xa0solutions to choose fromUS DOD wants right-to-repair provisions in Army contracts\\nEfosa has been writing about technology for over 7 years, initially driven by curiosity but now fueled by a strong passion for the field.

The broadcaster’s schedule of originals towers over competitors ABC and NBC. This past year, ratings grew 3% — a rare feat in an era of shrinking linear TV audiences.But that strength has been undermined by the company’s high-profile tangles with Trump, who brought a $20-billion lawsuit over edits of a “60 Minutes” interview last fall with then-Vice President Kamala Harris.First Amendment experts have described Trump’s lawsuit, which alleges the “60 Minutes” episode was fraudulent, as frivolous. But the president has remained defiant, saying CBS should be punished. Representatives of Trump and Paramount met with a mediator last week, but there was no immediate resolution of the lawsuit. Controlling shareholder Shari Redstone’s desire to end the wrangling with a settlement remains a cloud hanging over the company and its sale. More to Read Cheeks acknowledged the turmoil Wednesday.“This is an unprecedented, challenging time for the industry and for our company in particular,” Cheeks told about a dozen reporters gathered in a CBS conference room. “For me, what’s most important as a leader is how you show up in a difficult time. ...“My biggest goal is to make sure that the team feels supported and that we recognize that we have to focus on what we can control,” Cheeks said. “We’re going to get through this.”When asked whether CBS News and the group at “60 Minutes” would continue to enjoy his support, Cheeks said succinctly: “My entire team.” George Cheeks the at Lincoln Center in New York in January. (Kristina Bumphrey / Getty Images) The struggles with Trump have reverberated throughout the company and prompted internal protests. The executive producer of “60 Minutes,” Bill Owens, resigned last month, citing increased corporate pressure over news coverage. Correspondent Scott Pelley told “60 Minutes” viewers about Owens’ resignation in late April, noting that journalists had been facing increased corporate oversight.Since Trump’s suit was filed last fall, “60 Minutes” has remained dogged in its coverage of the Trump administration’s policies. On Sunday, Pelley reported on how Trump has used executive orders to target law firms that he accuses of “weaponizing” the justice system against him.Redstone has expressed frustration with “60 Minutes” for months. She was unhappy with the program’s coverage of the Israel-Hamas war and its effects on Gaza. She reportedly has asked Cheeks whether there were more “60 Minutes” stories coming that could antagonize Trump. A Redstone spokesperson declined to comment.When asked how he would approach a potential uprising within CBS News should the company settle with Trump, Cheeks said, “I’m not going to answer that question.”It’s been 10 months since Redstone agreed to sell Paramount, which includes the historic Melrose Avenue movie studio, Comedy Central, MTV and Paramount+, to David Ellison’s Skydance Media, a deal valued at $8 billion.The deal would see the Redstone family vacating its perch in Hollywood after nearly 40 years. Ellison and executives with RedBird Capital Partners would take over control of the company. Cheeks is expected to stay on in a high-profile role, sources have said.But the Federal Communications Commission has only begun preliminary steps to review the deal, which insiders had hoped would be finalized by early this spring. The two sides face an early October deadline to gain approval and close the deal. Paramount needs the FCC to consent to the transfer of CBS station licenses to the Ellison family.If the deal isn’t wrapped by mid-October, either side could back out. Paramount would owe a substantial breakup fee.Early this year, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee, opened a public inquiry into the “60 Minutes” Harris interview to gauge whether the edits rose to the level of news distortion.The results of the inquiry are pending.During the presentation, neither Cheeks or Reisenbach addressed Trump’s bombshell announcement Sunday that he planned to impose 100% tariffs on movies that are filmed in foreign countries, saying it was premature to speculate.Questions swirl about the feasibility of his proposal, and Trump did not say whether television shows would be included. CBS films several shows in Canada.Cheeks and Reisenbach told reporters their team was trying to block out the “noise” to focus on developing the new fall schedule, a sense of normalcy that was welcomed within CBS’ ranks. Next week begins the annual upfront sales season when advertisers place bets on the various network schedules.“George really creates an environment where we almost feel like we have the space and room to operate in a noise bubble,” Reisenbach said.CBS announced eight new series, including “Marshals,” a western drama from hitmaker Taylor Sheridan.

It’s in Paris’ Marais district, once the center of the city’s Jewish life. And it’s the first such exhibition in France. It takes a lot of time to assemble so many artworks from so many different collections and museums, but the show launched serendipitously not quite a month after Donald Trump was sworn in as president.His name does not appear in the exhibit, but a connection is palpable if not visible.Since Trump took office, the art world has watched his mission to end “woke” art in taxpayer-funded federal programs and institutions. He justified his takeover of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts by claiming on social media that he would put an end to “woke” performances of drag shows and “anti-American propaganda.” He filled its board with allies who voted him in as director. He’s cut the entire National Endowment for the Arts funding from his proposed budget. Vice president JD Vance has been tasked with removing “improper ideology” from the Smithsonian Institution, those things and ideas that “degrade shared American values” or “divide Americans based on race.” President Trump stands in the presidential box as he tours the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington on March 17. (Associated Press) This French museum’s show offers a flashback to the era when, apart from the works including those displayed here, the artists who created them were reviled and persecuted. Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, whose glamorous 1913 “Rue a Berlin” is here, died by suicide in 1938.Otto Freundlich’s striking Easter Island-style human head was on the cover of the original July 1937 Nazi exhibition guide to some 700 “degenerate” works, and beneath it the German word for “art” — “KUNST” — in capital letters and quote marks, leaving no question that the Nazis did not regard it as art at all.Freundlich was sent to a concentration camp on March 4, 1943, and died there five days later. Before the fatal train departed, he wrote a note to his partner and fellow artist, Jeanne Kosnick-Kloss, ending, “May heaven protect you and give you strength. I love you and will always be with you.”Room by room, the works unfurl their themes, among them “Race and Purity,” “Purging German Museums” and “Trade in Degenerate Art.”In 1933, Marc Chagall’s intense painting of a rabbi, “The Pinch of Snuff,” was an obvious target. Taken out of a museum in Mannheim, pulled through the city streets on a handcart, inviting Germans to mock it, and then set in an art gallery window with the sign, “Taxpayer, you should know how your money was spent.”Others make you wonder how they came to be reviled. Why would a striking Van Gogh landscape, “Field of Poppies,” be offensive? Probably because the Nazis classed him as anti-traditional as well as insane, as they did the avant-garde artist Elfriede Lohse-Wächtler. She was committed to an asylum, where she drew portraits of her fellow patients, some on display here. The Nazis murdered her under their forced euthanasia program. “Metropolis,” a painting by German artist George Grosz, is part of the “Degenerate Art: Modern Art on Trial Under the Nazis” at the Picasso Museum in Paris. (Stephane de Sakutin / AFP via Getty Images) George Grosz’s canvas “Metropolis” was painted during World War I and shows a nighttime street teeming with the delights and vices of city life. The Nazis put it on display and then sold it at auction, in 1939, as they did many of the artworks they damned, to finance their handiwork. The painting wound up in New York. So did Grosz, who years later bought it back himself.Most of the work is vertical, on the walls. But horizontally, under glass in a large table, this caught my attention: an engrossing collection of 1930s and 1940s newspaper clippings Picasso kept — he was quite the packrat — about the Hitler “degenerate” purges.My French is pretty fair, so I think I read it right. One article, on Aug. 20, 1937, is from the French illustrated weekly Voila, which was edited by a pair of Jewish brothers. The article appeared a month after July 18, 1937, when Hitler opened a Munich museum of approved Nazi artworks. The next day, he visited the “degenerate” art exhibition.Voila used the back-to-back events to mock Hitler and his taste in art, as well as “the violence of his methods and the scale of his offensive” against modern art.It begins by reminding readers of the incompetent doctors in the plays of French playwright Moliere, men who endangered their patients’ lives. It then likens Hitler to a doctor who cautions German artists to “paint according to my directives, otherwise you’ll be sterilized.”Instead, the writer imagines Hitler advising Germans to paint “scenes from the life of the SS and the SA,” Hitler’s armed Nazi forces, along with depictions of heroic young athletes in the mode of the mythic German hero Siegfried, and “opulently formed women.”Stingingly, the article shows readers some examples of Hitler’s own work, the rather stodgy and static products of a draftsman who aspires to art. Hitler twice applied and was twice rejected for admission to Vienna’s Academy of Fine Arts, which remarked on his “unfitness for painting.”The article notes that the mighty fuhrer had very recently “wielded a paintbrush,” and “not only as a housepainter.”That last is a sly point that’s been an enduring comic take of Hitler’s artistic preening. There’s debate of long standing that Hitler’s crusade against “degenerate” art grew in part from his academy rejections.The “housepainting Hitler” trope got a big boost, and a big laugh, in Mel Brooks’ 1967 film “The Producers.” The title characters find the worst screenplay they can, written by a crazed ex-Nazi soldier played by Kenneth Mars. The schnappsed-up Mars goes on a rant against Winston Churchill, “with his cigars, with his brandy, and his rotten painting! Rotten! Hitler — there was a painter! He could paint an entire apartment in one afternoon — two coats!” A painting of President Trump is seen in the Grand Foyer of the White House as Trump speaks about investing in America on April 30 in Washington. (Alex Brandon / Associated Press) With Trump now issuing an executive order about the contents of federal art institutions, his own artistic tastes are being highlighted, like his fondness for paintings of himself, and his touchiness about them. He and his supporters have shared “fan” portraits of him painted as a boxer, a general and a king. He recently received — reportedly from Vladimir Putin — a portrait of himself with raised fist after the assassination attempt in Pennsylvania last year.A portrait of him that had hung in the Colorado state capitol for almost six years — a painting commissioned by Colorado Republicans and paid for by a $10,000 GoFundMe campaign — recently was taken down after it came to Trump’s attention and he proclaimed it “truly the worst” image of himself.In 2016, the Washington Post detailed how Trump had spent $20,000 of his charitable foundation’s money to buy a large portrait of himself, which was said to have been installed in his New York golf club.Years before, when Trump invited his biographer Tim O’Brien aboard his plane as O’Brien was researching his 2005 book “Trump Nation,” O’Brien spotted what looked like the Renoir painting “Two Sisters (on the Terrace).” O’Brien said Trump told him, “You know, that’s an original Renoir.”In a Vanity Fair podcast, O’Brien said he told Trump, “Donald, it’s not.” He said, “I grew up in Chicago, that Renoir is called Two Sisters on the Terrace, and it’s hanging on a wall at the Art Institute of Chicago.”The original has, indeed, hung in the institute for more than 80 years. The Trump copy appeared to have been moved to Trump Tower, O’Brien said, because it could be seen in the background when “60 Minutes” interviewed Trump there not long after the 2016 election.The day before Germany’s 1937 “degenerate” art exhibit debuted, Hitler opened another art show, also in Munich — an apotheosis of Germanic taste, the “great German art exhibition.” Much of his speech was spent attacking the art he didn’t like.“Cubism, Dadaism, Futurism, Impressionism, etc., have nothing to do with our German people … I will therefore confess now, in this very hour, that I have come to the final inalterable decision to clean house, just as I have done in the domain of political confusion, and from now on rid the German art life of its phrase-mongering.”“ … with the opening of this exhibition, the end of German art foolishness and the end of the destruction of its culture will have begun. From now on we will wage an unrelenting war of purification against the last elements of putrefaction in our culture … “The German artist Otto Dix was unsparing in his painted critiques of war. He’d already been under the disapproving eyes of Nazis for years, and several months before the Munich “degenerate” art exhibit, he flung down this challenge in a letter to his fellow “degenerate” artists: “Then let’s stay what we are. Long live degeneracy!” Explaining L.A. With Patt Morrison Los Angeles is a complex place. In this weekly feature, Patt Morrison is explaining how it works, its history and its culture.

Join the rebellion.Talk about speaking truth to power. As Andor races to the end, \"Welcome to the Rebellion\" (season 2, episode 9) brings another propulsive 50-plus minutes of suspense, surprises, spy thriller set-pieces, and stirring monologues sure to become new slogans for our own earthbound resistance. It\\'s a great episode, and maybe even a phenomenal one, leaving even the most cynical Star Wars fan like myself—someone who very recently didn\\'t bother observing May the Fourth on Instagram—buzzing from the aftershock. It\\'s impossible to imagine Andor surpassing the dizzying highs of episode 8, but episode 9 keeps an upward trajectory at blazing speed. Though it is a bummer that this time next week, it\\'ll all be over. Then again, this Star Wars we\\'re talking about—it\\'s never truly over.Another year is over in Andor\\'s timeline, and next week begins the last march to Rogue One. Mon Mothma just dropped the mic like she\\'s CM Punk circa 2011. The galaxy heard her loud and clear—and now the Rebellion is truly in motion. So shall our recap of Andor\\'s latest episode.\"The Death of Truth is the Ultimate Victory of Evil\"In 2005, Genevieve O\\'Reilly first played Senator Mon Mothma in Revenge of the Sith, for a scene that wound up on the cutting room floor. Go back and watch her scene now. In the plastic world of the prequels, the founding of the Galactic Rebellion is stiff, like a stage play rendition of historical events instead of history happening in real time. It\\'s testament to a young O\\'Reilly that she still comes across assured, mature, and wise beyond her years. It\\'s unfortunate how the sleepy formalism of George Lucas\\'s prequel-era direction derails the whole thing. Twenty years later, and gone is the costume-play vibe in O\\'Reilly\\'s performance. Holding the Senate floor in an enthralling speech midway through the episode, O\\'Reilly\\'s Mon Mothma now speaks with gravity only years of experience could inform. Mon opens the episode with a distressing double-whammy, finding a bug in her office and learning from Luthen (Stellan Skarsgärd) that her own assistant Erskin (Pierro Niel-Mee) has been a spy on his behalf. Even if it\\'s for the Rebellion, it feels like a betrayal; Mon Mothma simply can\\'t ever escape this secret war.With the horrors of Ghorman prompting an emergency Senate hearing, Mon Mothma prepares a speech that will essentially out her as part of the Rebellion. Along the way she is torn between two paths: Escape with agents sent by Senator Bail Organa (Benjamin Bratt, substituting for a busy Jimmy Smitts), or escape with Cassian (Diego Luna, duh) sent by Luthen. Unbeknownst to Organa, his agents are compromised—intel Luthen uses to send Cassian instead. But one gets the slight impression that Mon Mothma would rather escape through the top-floor window than trust any stranger.Des WillieIn the end, Mon Mothma gives a speech that infuriates the Empire, splits the floor, and is heard all across the galaxy. And what a speech it is—a call to arms on behalf of truth over resting in propaganda\\'s comforts. \"I believe we are in a crisis,\" she pleads. \"The distance between what is said, and what is known to be true has become an abyss ... The death of truth is the ultimate victory of evil. When truth leaves us, when we let it slip away, when it is ripped from our hands, we become vulnerable to the appetite of whatever monster screams the loudest.\" So, can O\\'Reilly recite this speech on Capitol Hill? I just need it said loud and clear: Episode 9 is the culmination of a miracle. Throughout the course of Andor, Mon Mothma has evolved from tertiary action figure to a real character, an individual with perspective and conviction while haunted by unseen repercussions. When she first appeared in the series I was dismissive; more for Wookiepedia, I scoffed. But Andor kept going. Now, at its end, Mon Mothma isn\\'t just a new personal favorite character of mine. She might be one of the most consequential in Star Wars ever, in league with Luke and Obi-Wan. To think that once upon a time, she was just a deleted scene.Dear CassianMon Mothma holds the floor, but there\\'s so much else happening around her. As Organa\\'s team implodes from betrayal, Andor races to get Mon Mothma to Yavin. Using his fake Mid-Rim News credentials, Cassian sneaks his way to Mon, though not before acquiring help from Erskin. Indeed, they have friends everywhere.Once Mon and Cassian meet (for the first time, too!), it\\'s all forward-moving action as Andor packs \"Welcome to the Rebellion\" with Bourne Identity-esque foot chases, Mexican standoffs, and a reverberating synth score. If there\\'s any feature that truly separates Andor from the Skywalker Saga, it\\'s the music. Eschewing the grand majesty of John Williams\\' compositions, Andor is stripped down and familiar, its soundscape akin to modern spy thrillers. Brandon Roberts is the composer for Andor this season, his work mostly defined by horror movies like Underwater (2020), Black Box (2020), and Thanksgiving (2023). Roberts appears to know about music that gets the blood pumping, but one also imagines production using Hans Zimmer as a temp track and realizing how well the combination works. Ultimately, and unlike the previous episode, Cassian succeeds in his mission. He extracts Mon Mothma to Luthen\\'s dumpy safe house—where Mon notices Cassian has maybe lived there before—and then to Yavin. Cassian is told official records will say that Gold Squadron performed the job. (This is a reference to pre-existing canon.) But it doesn\\'t matter to Cassian; what matters is the job. And Cassian has done his job, apparently for good. Returning to Bix (Adria Arjona), Cassian declares his intentions to retire from the Rebellion and find a place for the two of them to live in peace. \"I want this. Right here. I want to be with you,\" Cassian tells her. But you can read it on Bix\\'s face. You can see it in her avoidant eyes. Something is wrong. In the morning sun, Cassian wakes to an empty bed. In a video message that is basically a Dear John letter, Bix tells Cassian she \"cannot be the reason\" he leaves the Rebellion. The Force healer\\'s words still in her ears, Bix believes Cassian is meant to do great things for the movement, and she knows she can\\'t have Cassian until his job is done. All of it. So she leaves. Where to and for how long stays open-ended, and frankly, it doesn\\'t matter. We know how things will end for Cassian. And we know now what he\\'s given up to fight for the Rebellion. It all makes his appearance in Rogue One that much more meaningful. The whole time, Cassian is thinking about someone to get back to, even if he never gets the chance to.Lucasfilm Ltd™Cassian has lost Bix, but he gains someone new: K-2SO.A Spark of HumorSpeaking of Rogue One, the K-2 unit that nearly killed Cassian in the last episode is finally repaired and rewired by Rebellion engineers. There\\'s some fun acknowledgement about the possible ethical violation of reconfiguring a Droid; in the Star Wars universe, Droids are considered alive to a degree, even if they are second-class citizens. \"You\\'ll hear a lot of blather about \\'re-programming,\\'\" says a Rebellion tech, before adding, \"it\\'s nonsense.\" Given that we now live in a reality where A.I. is starting to take over people\\'s livelihoods—sure, whatever you say. The point is that the episode ends with K-2SO waking up—he\\'s voiced by the delightful Alan Tudyk, with his dry sense of humor intact from (and for) Rogue One.

Join the rebellion.Every Andor episode, I swear I begin my recap with a sweeping platitude (or three). Last week, I talked about how episode 4 built the Rebellion from the ground up. Leaving season 2, episode 7? I\\'m thinking about something that has probably crossed your mind once or twice over the course of Andor: The Force of It All.During Andor\\'s nearly two-season-long run so far, series creator Tony Gilroy has shown remarkable restraint when it comes to anything and everything involving lightsabers, religious mysticism, and the F-word. I know there aren\\'t all that many Jedi around the galaxy during Andor\\'s timeline, but still—I\\'m sure that, in different hands, a Jedi would\\'ve shown up to slice and dice some Imperial goons by now. By keeping the Jedi and their lil\\' Padawan braids out of the proceedings, Andor infinitely increases the stakes, urgency, and believability of the Rebellion. Why would I actually fear for Cassian and Bix\\'s safety when I know that Disney will smash a de-aged Qui-Gon Jinn into the middle of a blaster fight?That said, I was surprised to see Andor introduce the presence of a Force healer on the Yavin Rebel base. True to Andor, though, the healer\\'s inclusion is very much intentional—because it foreshadows the ending of Cassian\\'s story. Disney+Dedra, pull back before it’s too late!Do You Want to Fight? Or Do You Want to Win?Andor\\'s latest batch of episodes continues this season\\'s brilliant pacing. At the top of episode 7, we learn that another year passed in the world of the show between drops. The year is BBY 2 now, and the Rebellion is suddenly looking incredibly legitimate, organized, and maybe even ready to kick some Imperial ass. We pick up with Wilmon (The Boy), who is enjoying his first day at the Yavin Rebel base. He\\'s greeted by the sight of Bix and Andor macking on each other. Damn, someone tell these two that they\\'re on the same streaming service as Elsa and Ratatouille!The family reunion ends as soon as Cassian and Wilmon start barking at each other. Wilmon was last seen huffing Rhydonium with Saw, but somehow he\\'s Luthen\\'s messenger boy now. He tells Cassian about the need to take down Dedra, who is currently on Ghorman, \"waiting to be killed.\" Cassian, ever the rebel, immediately rebukes the latest order from Luthen while also managing to sound hilariously like Luthen. \"Do you want to fight?\" Cassian asks. \"Or do you want to win?\" I Guess the Force Healer Saw Rogue OneBack to our new friend, Ms. Anonymous Force Healer! Poor Cass suffers a blaster burn from a previous fight, which—you hate to see it—Bix\\'s PG-13 Disney kisses can\\'t fix. While the two walk around the base, they spot a small crowd around a mysterious Force healer. As soon as Cassian nears the area, the woman senses what is commonly known around these parts as a disturbance in the Force. She approaches Cassian and asks to touch his injury. When the woman is done, she mumbles a bunch of Yoda-isms that make it sound like someone slipped her a DVD copy of Rogue One befores he met Cassian. \"The clarity. That feeling. It’s been a very long time,\" she mutters. \"All that you’ve been gathering—the strength of spirit.\" The healer adds that she senses the \"weight of things\" she can\\'t see. Some beings hold the past with them, but some are \"gathering as they go.\" Cassian is a messenger. She tells Bix, \"There\\'s some place he needs to be.\"Well, anyone who has seen 2016\\'s Rogue One should pick up that Cassian needs to be with Jyn Erso to complete the most important Rebel mission of his life. Andor is, after all, a prequel to Rogue One. And the message? The schematics that tip to a defect built in to the Death Star. Pretty important stuff. Now, all I need to know is how the Force Healer rated Rogue One on Letterboxd.Disney+It looks like Mon Mothma will have to take a stand sooner than we thought. My Sources Say This Is NonsenseWell, my fellow romantics, domestic bliss is a distant memory for our sick and twisted lovebirds, Dedra and Syril. Near the top of the episode, Dedra\\'s Empire middle-manager lets her know that the Emperor is moving forward with the \"original plan\"—a.k.a. the abhorrent scheme to strip Ghorman of its Death Star-powering raw materials.

Syril\\'s face screams, \"I love my big bad mommy girlfriend, but the thought of her incinerating an entire planet and its civilians is kind of making me feel icky!\" Love these two.

But, if your opponent also drinks, you can't shoot next round, and if you both shoot at the same time, you both lose. Or, just you lose really.

Itineraries vary. Sometimes we get a submarine and explore the oceans. Sometimes, inspired by shows like Million Dollar Listing and Selling Sunset, we head up to the Hills and have a pleasant in-game evening racing through rich people\\'s backyards. My wife knows the game much better than me, which makes for an unusual dynamic. I know Los Angeles, which Los Santos is based on, but she is far more familiar with Rockstar\\'s version. In other words, I\\'m often a backseat passenger in the endless lateral tracking shot that defines the common experience of both of these car-centric cities.\\nA few weeks back, we avoided the usual stuff, though, and ended up somewhere I had not seen before. We\\'d decided not to jump the fence at the military base and try to steal a jet - a pass-the-pad process that for some reason we\\'ve taken to calling \"dipping it low\", in honour, perhaps, of the tricky fence position, the chassis-scraping jump, and the Christina Milian banger. We didn\\'t even head to Nakatomi Plaza, where my wife has an apartment, to spend a happy few hours parachuting off the roof. Instead, in a freeway tunnel somewhere, I was cruising along and I suddenly saw a gap in the wall. \"Oh, down there!\" my wife said. \"It goes deep.\" And it does.\\nI nosed our car through the gap and we spent the next hour or so exploring this strange underside of Los Santos, rattling through storm drains, sewers, and sections of the subway system. It was classic GTA: a world of human detailing, but just about designed to be experienced in a car. It felt sneaky and illicit. And it was also sort of dizzying. I know the city above relatively well now, just from years of watching my wife play. But all of this was lurking underneath the whole time? How did it get there? Why is there so much city under the city in this game?\\nI guess it was the weather: Here\\'s the classic GTA 5 trailer.Watch on YouTube\\nThe answer to this question - and to most things in my life - resides in one of my favourite books of the last 10 years. A Burglar\\'s Guide to the City, by Geoff Manaugh. I know I\\'ve mentioned this before on Eurogamer. I will not stop mentioning it until everyone has a copy, frankly. It\\'s a book that explores the fascinating ways that criminals utilise the urban environment. It\\'s the book I most often give as a birthday present. It\\'s one of those rare books that genuinely changes the way you look at the world.\\nPart of Manaugh\\'s thesis is that burglars are super-users of the environment. They\\'re incredibly creative when it comes to moving about the urban world, dropping in through the roof, smashing through walls, jimmying windows, and drilling. Oh, the drilling.\\nInevitably, this is a book about LA as much as it\\'s a book about burglary. Inevitably because, as Manaugh memorably points out, for a period in the 1990s, LA was the bank robbery capital of the world. A lot of this came down to the freeway system: Manaugh talks about stop-and-rob banks, located near freeway on- and off-ramps that were so conducive to fast getaways the banks could essentially be robbed on a whim. These are banks where it would have been stupid not to rob them. But there\\'s also something else. LA is a city unlike any others. Hugely wide, hugely scattered, home to all kinds of weird architectural follies and preoccupations, there\\'s just something about this place that encourages people to be creative with the landscape and the way they use it.\\nAnd here\\'s the trailer for GTA 6.Watch on YouTube\\nAll of which is to say this:\\n\"In June 1986, employees at a First Interstate Bank in Hollywood, at the corner of Sunset and Spaulding, in a building that now houses a talent agency, began to report strange mechanical sounds coming from the ground near the vault.\"\\nSo begins Manaugh\\'s telling of the story of the Hole in the Ground Gang, some of the most daring and creative bank robbers to ever play the game.\\nThe strange mechanical sounds were investigated, Manaugh continues, but the sensors had not been tripped and nobody could find any signs of anything awry. The police dismissed the reports as \"just a rat running around inside the walls or something.\" But the sounds continued for a week. The power sometimes cut out along with the phones. \"Then,\" writes Manaugh, \"the internal Muzak system abruptly kicked in late one evening, startling a manager who was there alone working overtime.\"\\nImage credit: Rockstar\\nAll of this was the result of a small team of burglars excavating their way into the vault. Muzak aside, they worked meticulously. They took their time. They knew the city\\'s subterranean waterways and they clearly understood a lot about mining. They had access to storm-sewer maps, utilising connections that \"were by no means obvious, knowing that a manhole several blocks away from a bank might take you within a few hundred feet of the vault.\"\\nLA, Manaugh reveals, is riddled with underground passages, buried rivers, corridors and hallways and drains. He cites the landscape architect Jessica Hall, who once explained that the fog at the intersection of Beverly and Rossmore is due to a perennial creek that runs underground there. The Hole in the Ground Gang knew this kind of stuff. They \"would have needed intimate knowledge of the ground itself, of the actual geology of Los Angeles\" in order to pull off their heist.\\nImage credit: Rockstar\\nTo rob the vault, elaborate tunnels were created, and the burglars eventually moved through them and the connecting sewers beneath West Hollywood in Suzuki four-wheelers. These vehicles were used to move \"more than $172,000 in cash and as much as $2.5 million worth of personal belongings ripped from the safe-deposit boxes,\" Manaugh says. They got away with it, too. The statute of limitations has now passed. Manaugh talks to a former investigator who just wants to meet the gang and chat about their work, perhaps over a \"no-hard-feelings beer.\"\\nI love this story. The audacity of it. The ingenuity and planning and deep knowledge of the deep city. And it\\'s this burglary, I would suggest, that has helped shape the geology of Los Santos in GTA 5. The game world is, in a literal sense, built upon the landscape that the Hole in the Ground Gang made visible. The game is haunted by it.\\nEven my limited understanding of the game makes this clear. GTA 5\\'s campaign revolves around a series of heists, and at least two of them invoke the work of the Hole in the Ground Gang. In the Jewel Store Job, part of the team escapes on bikes through sewers and storm drains, before emerging into the riverbed. It\\'s a fantastic sequence, involving great speed and the innate vulnerability of motorbikes as they move through this looping, elbowy network of spaces.\\nImage credit: Rockstar\\nLater, in the final mission, The Big Score, players can choose to drill into the vault being robbed from below, while the building\\'s staff are held-up at gunpoint above. Again, the mission culminates in another escape through the sewers and storm drains and bodged-together tunnels of Los Santos, this time in an actual car.\\nLots of films seem to have heard of the Hole in the Ground Gang: it\\'s referenced in Speed and in the 2000s remake of The Italian Job. There\\'s a special mystery and a dark glory about crimes like this, that take place below our feet, without us knowing. Crimes that briefly illuminate a world we live alongside without realising. GTA 5, though, goes further than most. The topside/underground flow of the game, with its endless chases, its endless freeform connections, makes me feel as if Los Santos has been marinated in the work of the Hole in the Ground Gang. It\\'s in there deep. I feel like the game would be a different shape without this foundational story.\\nRockstar\\'s developers are not the only people haunted by this stuff, though. Manaugh ends his narrative of the Hole in the Ground Gang by telling the story of a second attempted robbery by the same team. A year after the first heist, they struck at the intersection of La Cienega and Pico, in a job that would have robbed two banks simultaneously.\\nImage credit: Rockstar\\nThe gang were interrupted mid-job, although they escaped on their Suzukis once more. If they\\'d succeeded, Manaugh says, the haul would have been between $10 and $25 million. But beyond the money, Manaugh also describes the human cost, including \"the disoriented, almost psychedelic\" reaction of one of the first FBI agents on the scene. \"The presence of two bank tunnels, the second of which was only discovered hours after the first, inspired an uneasy, vertiginous sense that more tunnels might - in fact, probably would - be found. Law enforcement \"started getting these nagging mental images of a network of tunnels under every bank in West LA... of waking up one morning and finding five or 10 or 100 bank vaults simultaneously breached and stripped.\"\\nI can appreciate this feeling just a little. My own grandfather was an LA cop in the 40s and 50s and was completely consumed with the bank robber Willie Sutton. Sergeant Donlan spent his time patrolling Pershing Square, but his heart belonged to Sutton. He felt personally insulted by Sutton. He felt that it was his destiny to catch him at some point, interrupting one of his many crimes. He never did. But he was still mentioning him at family dinners as late as the 1990s.\\n\"The burglar,\" Manaugh concludes, \"is a three-dimensional actor amidst the two-dimensional surfaces of the city. This means operating with a fundamentally different spacial sense of how architecture should work.\" And isn\\'t that just GTA in microcosm? Isn\\'t that games and the people who are eternally drawn to play them?\\nAll the details of the Hole in the Ground Gang in this piece come from A Burglar\\'s Guide to the City, by Geoff Manaugh. Manaugh\\'s most recent book, written with Nicola Twilley, is Until Proven Safe: The History and Future of Quarantine.

It won’t be as easy to discover as the rest of the recipe, but there is a way to quicken the process. You can farm Silicon fast by defeating enemies, who typically drop these resources alongside Carbon. Although it’s possible to mine Silicon veins, I didn’t have much luck finding this material with this method. Screenshot and remix by Destructoid Any enemy seems to drop Silicon in Revenge of the Savage Planet, including Raccoccos. Kick them or use your gun, and you’ll see the Silicon floating near their grimy corpses. If you prefer a more peaceful approach, you can search for yellow-colored veins and punch them for this resource. As mentioned, the veins aren’t as common as other resources, and you may need to rely on enemies instead. There might be a spot rich in Silicon that I haven’t found yet, so feel free to explore the area for better chances. As you progress through the story, you’ll also have more opportunities on the remaining planets. Screenshot by Destructoid Once you’ve gathered enough, return to your 3D Printer to craft the Power Hose. This weapon allows you to take down slimy and plant-based creatures, as well as clean off anything murky. Your first task with it requires you to clear off the slime outside your Habitat’s dish. It’s the only way to get your base fully functional. The Power Hose isn’t the only upgrade you can use Silicon with, since this material is also found in a variety of modernized creations, such as the Snork Heat Sink, Rawhide Utility Belt, and Pyrex Loot Magnet. You can keep track of how much Silicon you have in your inventory by looking for the yellow circular icon. It appears alongside the other two crucial resources: Aluminum and Carbon. Fortunately, Aluminum and Carbon appear more frequently than Silicon. You’ll need all three to craft numerous upgrades and builds that help you survive longer in Revenge of the Savage Planet.

King’s 1979 novel (written under his Richard Bachman pseudonym) has been heading toward theoretical film production since at least 1988, when Night of the Living Dead director George A. Romero was reportedly attached to direct.King fan and filmmaker Frank Darabont (director of The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, and The Mist) held onto the rights for decades, promising he’d eventually make the movie. News that longtime Stephen King producer Roy Lee (the It movies) had bought the rights and that Francis Lawrence (the Hunger Games movies) would be directing The Long Walk sounded promising, though. And now the film finally has a trailer and a release date, strongly implying that it might actually be happening this time.The long journey to The Long Walk is endlessly surprising — on a surface level, it seems like one of Stephen King’s most eminently filmable horror stories. In a dystopic future America, a contest is held every year where 100 teenage boys set out on a walk together, accompanied by a military escort. Anyone who drops below a certain speed gets three warnings before being shot in the head. The Long Walk continues until there’s only one survivor, who gets anything he wants. And that’s the entire story. It sounds simple, but it’s one of King’s most beautiful and nuanced books, with most of the story happening in the character interactions between the doomed boys and the eventual winner. Here’s Lionsgate’s summary of the film:From the highly anticipated adaptation of master storyteller Stephen King’s first-written novel, and Francis Lawrence, the visionary director of The Hunger Games franchise films (Catching Fire, Mockingjay – Pts. 1 & 2 , and The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes), comes THE LONG WALK, an intense, chilling, and emotional thriller that challenges audiences to confront a haunting question: how far could you go?Cooper Hoffman (Saturday Night, Licorice Pizza) stars as Ray Garraty — an interesting casting, because while at age 22, he seems too old to play the 16-year-old Garraty, he’s proven himself to be a terrific and nuanced young actor over a variety of projects. The cast also includes Mark Hamill as The Major, the mysterious military leader behind the Long Walk, Charlie Plummer (King Jack) as intolerable foil Gary Barkovitch, and David Jonsson (broken android Andy from Alien: Romulus) as Garraty’s friend Peter McVries. Garrett Wareing, Tut Nyuot, Ben Wang, Roman Griffin Davis, Jordan Gonzalez, Joshua Odjick, and Josh Hamilton round out the featured cast.

It said these had achieved their aims and were not providing much benefit.The plans, which will chip away at rules designed to prevent a future financial crisis, are part of the FCA’s response to prime minister Sir Keir Starmer’s call for regulators to focus on promoting economic growth.\\xa0“These proposals can allow lenders greater scope to innovate and develop their own approaches to deliver good outcomes, and in doing so empower borrowers to make the right choices for their mortgage,” said Aladhal.\\xa0Banks welcomed the announcement. “The proposals should prove beneficial for those looking to remortgage or reduce their mortgage term,” said Charles Roe, director of mortgages at the UK Finance trade body. “The changes will help drive the government’s growth agenda in a way that benefits our members, and their mortgage customers.”However, there are fears the regulator is diluting consumer protections. “The FCA will need to watch the market very carefully after these rules come into force to ensure they don’t drive a return to the era of mis-selling or catalyse a new era of mis-buying,” said James Daley, head of consumer group Fairer Finance.Under the proposals, lenders would be allowed to do a lighter affordability assessment of a customer when offering to remortgage at a cheaper rate than their existing lender.Last year, 83 per cent of people who remortgaged stayed with their existing lender and the FCA said this reflected “several barriers or transaction costs, both in time and money” when seeking a mortgage from a different provider.Lenders would be freed from having to conduct a full affordability assessment when customers are reducing the term of their mortgage. The FCA said 41 per cent of new mortgages last year extended beyond the state pension age of 67 and reducing the term would lower the risk of repayment problems “later in life”.The regulator said it also aimed to make it easier for customers to arrange a mortgage without having to go through the formal process of receiving regulated advice, which includes the lender checking if a home loan is suitable.In the past two decades, 97 per cent of customers getting a new mortgage have received regulated advice from their lender. That is up from about 70 per cent before the FCA introduced stricter requirements in 2014 in response to the 2008 financial crisis.The FCA said its 2014 rule had restricted “more than intended” the ability of consumers to opt out of advice when they knew the precise home loan they wanted and were confident of not needing the extra protection of having the suitability assessed.Its rules would not change for higher risk customers, such as those consolidating debt, exercising a statutory “right to buy” their home, with shared equity arrangements or on lifetime mortgages.The regulator said it was able to dilute some requirements since introducing consumer duty rules two years ago that require firms to ensure customers get good outcomes. But it said there was a risk its proposals could mean people are “more likely to choose an unsuitable or more expensive product”.\\xa0Companies have until June 4 to respond to the consultation.', 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: UK to loosen mortgage lending rules\\nENTITIES: UK Financial Conduct Authority, Keir Starmer, UK Finance\\nEVENT: UK regulator plans to dilute mortgage lending rules, easing affordability assessments and advice requirements for some borrowers.\\nCONTEXT: Relaxing mortgage rules aims to boost economic growth.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 50756, 'sourceId': 12613, 'url': 'https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/pakistan-india-david-lammy-indian-rishi-sunak-b1226342.html', 'title': 'Starmer calls for calm amid ‘rising tensions’ between India and Pakistan', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T18:57:13.000Z', 'content': 'Sir Keir Starmer called for India and Pakistan to take steps to ease the “rising tensions” following exchanges of fire in Kashmir.The Prime Minister said the UK was encouraging “dialogue, de-escalation and the protection of civilians”.Pakistan has described Delhi’s missile attacks as an “act of war” and responded with shelling on the Indian side of the line of control.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer addressed the rising tensions in the Commons (Stefan Rousseau/PA)PA WireAt least 26 people, including a child, are reported to have died in the missile strikes which came in retaliation to last month’s massacre of tourists in the Indian part of Kashmir.Pakistan responded with shelling – killing seven civilians according to Indian police and medics – and claimed to have shot down Indian fighter jets.At Prime Minister’s Questions, Sir Keir said: “Rising tensions between India and Pakistan will be of serious concern for many across Britain.“We are engaging urgently with both countries as well as other international partners, encouraging dialogue, de-escalation and the protection of civilians.”Sir Keir Starmer called for calm at the beginning of PMQs (House of Commons/UK Parliament/PA)PA WireThe Foreign Office has updated its travel advice for the region, warning against all travel within 10 kilometres of the India-Pakistan border and 10 miles of the line of control, the de facto border that divides disputed Kashmir.In a separate statement, Foreign Secretary David Lammy called for India and Pakistan to “show restraint and engage in direct dialogue to find a swift, diplomatic path forward”.Mr Lammy said he had “made clear to my counterparts in India and Pakistan that if this escalates further, nobody wins”.He added: “The UK was clear in its condemnation of the horrific terrorist attack in Pahalgam last month. We need all sides to work urgently to see regional stability restored and ensure protection of civilians.”Former prime minister Rishi Sunak backed India’s right to retaliate after the terrorist attack.He said: “No nation should have to accept terrorist attacks being launched against it from land controlled by another country.“India is justified in striking terrorist infrastructure. There can be no impunity for terrorists.”Around 50 people gathered outside the High Commission of India in central London on Wednesday evening to protest over the violence in Kashmir.Protesters chanted for Pakistan and called for peace in the region.The escalation in the conflict between the two nuclear-armed powers follows last month’s massacre, which New Delhi has blamed Pakistan for.Islamabad has denied responsibility for the attack by armed militants near Pahalgam.Asked if Sir Keir agreed with his predecessor Mr Sunak, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “We are going to continue to engage with both sides, we don’t want to see any escalation to this conflict.”The spokesman said “the safety of British nationals in the region remains our top priority”.Meanwhile, the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) expressed concern about the impact of events in Kashmir on British Indian and Pakistani communities, noting “heightened emotions” in recent days.Maswood Ahmed, deputy secretary general of the MCB, said: “In these tense times, we must all play our part.“The MCB stands ready to engage with authorities, faith institutions and both Pakistani and Indian communities to ensure our streets remain peaceful.”In the Commons, Foreign Office minister Hamish Falconer told MPs: “The British Pakistani and British Indian communities make a huge contribution to this country.

The Lords Science and Technology Committee has written to the Prime Minster, Home Secretary, Chancellor and Science Minister to say reforms are urgently needed following increasing global competition for STEM workers. The committee argues that funding policies under Donald Trump’s US administration have left many American scientists seeking to relocate to other countries. Other nations, including France, Germany, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Canada and Australia, have already announced programmes to encourage them to move there. Britain is set miss out because of a complex and costly process that means UK visa fees for scientists are amongst the highest in the world, the committee warns. It is planning to publish its Immigration White Paper next week, which will lay out the details of Sir Keir Starmer’s plan to reduce immigration. In his letter published on Wednesday, committee chair Lord Robert Mair, said: “The Government must seize this rare opportunity to rectify the situation where it is putting up unnecessarily high barriers to the global talent that want to live and work here, harming the national interest and in stark contrast to the actions of other nations. “At a time of dramatic geopolitical and technological change, our action––or inaction––right now will have a huge impact on our future. We cannot afford business as usual.”Visas for science, research and engineering roles fell by a third in the second half last year compared to the period in 2023. Lord Mair added: “We understand that the Government was elected on a pledge to reduce overall immigration numbers–but the Global Talent visa accounts for only around 4,000 people a year, less than 1% of the overall figures in 2024.“Reducing overall net migration is therefore not incompatible with increasing the proportion of science and technology experts who receive visas.”As part of the Government’s immigration crackdown, visa applications from nationalities considered most likely to overstay and claim asylum in Britain could be restricted. In its manifesto, Labour promised that it would bring down the numbers of people coming into the country from abroad. The party said that the overall level of net migration “must be properly controlled and managed”.UK visa applications have significantly fallen in recent months, particularly for those coming for jobs in the NHS and social care, after tough new restrictions on eligibility were introduced in early 2024 under the previous Government.But asylum applications have rocketed. Home Office figures show a total of 108,138 people applied for asylum in Britain in 2024, the highest number for any 12-month period since current records began in 2001.A Home Office spokesman said: “To tackle abuse by foreign nationals who arrive on work and study visas and go on to claim asylum, we are building intelligence on the profile of these individuals to identify them earlier and faster.“We keep the visa system under constant review and will where we detect trends, which may undermine our immigration rules, we will not hesitate to take action. “Under our plan for change, our upcoming Immigration White Paper will set out a comprehensive plan to restore order to our broken immigration system.”', 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: UK visa policy concerns amid immigration plans\\nENTITIES: Lords Science and Technology Committee, UK Government, Sir Keir Starmer, Lord Robert Mair, Home Office, NHS\\nEVENT: The Lords committee warns that current UK visa policies create barriers for attracting STEM workers, while the government plans to reveal new immigration restrictions, even as asylum applications surge.\\nCONTEXT: UK visa policy faces criticism amid global talent race.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 50730, 'sourceId': 12613, 'url': 'https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/rachel-reeves-economy-fiscal-rules-budget-chancellor-tax-b1226465.html', 'title': 'Chancellor Rachel Reeves on track to miss fiscal rules by £63billion, says economic forecaster', 'publishDate': '2025-05-08T06:50:44.000Z', 'content': 'The Government is on track to miss its key fiscal rules, increasing the likelihood of tax hikes later this year, an economic think tank has warned.Economic growth is also on track to be weaker than previously expected this year, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr).Fresh forecasts from the organisation indicated that a slowdown in domestic demand and global economic uncertainty will impact potential growth throughout the year.It predicted that the UK economy will grow by 1.2% in 2025 “amid low business confidence, high uncertainty and rising cost pressures”.In its previous forecasts in February, Niesr had pointed to 1.5% growth for the year.The think tank indicated that the reduced level of growth will result in lower than previously predicted tax receipts.As a result, it said the Government is now expected to miss its fiscal rules requiring UK national debt as a share of the economy to fall and to be on course for a budget surplus.In the Government’s spring statement, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said state finances were on track to give a headroom worth around £9.9 billion by 2029/30.Niesr’s forecasts suggest this could now be set for a shortfall of £62.9 billion over this time frame, suggesting the Treasury could need to look at more spending cuts or tax increases to achieve a surplus.Stephen Millard, Niesr interim director, said: “The Chancellor’s self-imposed and arbitrary fiscal rules have led to a situation where twice a year the Chancellor has to either find further departmental savings or announce politically unpalatable tax rises.“The uncertainty created by this leads to low investment and lower growth, the precise reverse of what the government wants to achieve. We have to rethink the fiscal framework.”The organisation’s fiscal outlook also pointed towards rising inflation for the year, which it expects to average 3.3% in 2025.Previously, Niesr had predicted it would average 2.4% for the year, with a peak of 3.2%.It is the latest body to trim back the UK’s economic growth contexts amid pressure from changes to US tariff policies on the global economy.Adrian Pabst, deputy director for public policy at the organisation, said: “The Government’s ambition of boosting growth and living standards in every part of the United Kingdom requires a comprehensive, credible plan of economic transformation which is yet to emerge.“While planning reform and infrastructure investments in London and the South East will add to GDP growth, we need higher public investment in second-tier cities and poorer regions to unlock greater business investment.”The Conservatives meanwhile accused Ms Reeves of “playing fast and loose with the public finances”.Shadow chancellor Mel Stride added: “She should have learned lessons after she was forced into an emergency budget in March.“Now she is once again teetering on the edge of breaking her own fiscal rules.“This inevitably means rising speculation about further painful tax rises come the autumn, all at a time when businesses are in desperate need of certainty, and households are worried about rising bills.”', 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: UK growth forecast cut; fiscal rules threatened\\nENTITIES: Rachel Reeves, National Institute of Economic and Social Research, Niesr, UK Treasury\\nEVENT: Niesr forecasts UK economic growth lower than expected, leading to a £63 billion shortfall in government finances by 2029/30.\\nCONTEXT: Fiscal rules may require tax hikes or spending cuts.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 50763, 'sourceId': 12613, 'url': 'https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/hiv-people-government-symonds-campaigners-b1226421.html', 'title': 'Infected blood victims will die before they get compensation, minister accepts', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T16:50:28.000Z', 'content': 'Some victims of the infected blood scandal will die before they receive compensation and the current number of people who have received a payout is “unsatisfactory”, the Government has admitted.People affected by the scandal, dubbed the “biggest disaster in the history of the NHS”, said they “don’t have time on our side” as they urged officials to speed up compensation payments.Sir Brian Langstaff, chairman of the Infected Blood Inquiry, is holding two days of special hearings to examine the “timeliness and adequacy of the Government’s response to compensation”.Opening the hearing, Sir Brian said: “It is no secret that the inquiry has received letter after letter, email after email, call after call, expressing worries and concerns about how compensation is being delivered.“The inquiry will do everything in its power to identify action that can be taken by the Government and by the Infected Blood Compensation Authority to improve the delivery of compensation and to ensure that justice is done.”Cabinet Office minister Nick Thomas–Symonds began his evidence by apologising to victims.“I know many people before me will have suffered unimaginably because of this scandal, I would like to acknowledge that the government has failed you over decades on behalf of the state. I am sorry,” he said.Pointing out that it could be years before some people will receive compensation, inquiry counsel Jenni Richards KC asked Mr Thomas–Symonds whether both infected and affected people will die before they receive compensation.“Yes,” he replied.The minister, who was heckled as he gave evidence, told the hearing that he is “restless for further progress on payments”.Ms Richards read out the latest compensation figures from the IBCA, which show that just over 100 people have received a payment, saying: “That’s a profoundly unsatisfactory state of affairs, isn’t it?”Mr Thomas–Symonds replied: “It absolutely is, and I’m never going to think this is satisfactory until everybody has received the compensation they are due.”He said that he is pressing the IBCA on how the process can “speed up”, including asking whether more risks can be taken to ensure prompt payments.Mr Thomas-Symonds was also challenged on whether infections which occurred before January 1 1982 will “fall outside the liability window”.The minister told the inquiry he would “go away and look at that situation”.He also said he would consider a “supplemental route” for affected people including children, parents and siblings.Campaigners representing people infected and affected by the scandal gave emotional evidence on Wednesday morning.Andrew Evans, from the campaign group Tainted Blood, shared a quote from one of the members of the group, who said: “I’m utterly exhausted. The anguish is beyond words. I just want this over.”Mr Evans, who was infected with HIV and hepatitis C through contaminated blood products during treatment for haemophilia as a child, said that victims have been left feeling “betrayed and disappointed”, adding: “People have given up on any expectation of receiving anything.“They have lost all hope of ever getting justice.”Gary Webster was infected while at Lord Mayor’s Treloar School and College in Hampshire (Ben Whitley/PA)PA WireGary Webster, who was infected with HIV and hepatitis C when he attend Lord Mayor’s Treloar School in Hampshire (Treloar’s) in the 1970s and 80s, said his experience with the compensation scheme had been a “nightmare”.The 60-year-old said: “People will not get their compensation and a lot of claims will die with them.“It’s just too slow and people won’t get the justice they deserve.”Campaigner Carolyn Challis was infected with hepatitis C when she received blood transfusions during chemotherapy treatment for lymphatic cancer between 1992 and 1993.The mother-of-three from North Devon said that the compensation scheme is “not fit for purpose”.“We don’t have time on our side or the energy to keep fighting for justice,” she said.Bill Wright, from Haemophilia Scotland, told the inquiry that the scandal was the “biggest disaster in NHS history”.The report into the infected blood scandal was published in May 2024 (Jeff Moore/PA)PA ArchiveMeanwhile, Alan Burgess, who was co-infected with HIV and hepatitis C while receiving treatment for haemophilia, said that the ICBA was “playing games with our mental health”.He added: “They’re playing games with our mental health and our physical health – they’ve got to be made to realise what they’re doing.“It’s like trying to nail custard to the wall, you can talk to them but they don’t seem to listen.”He also told the hearing victims were dying while the process was ongoing, with one of his friends dying just weeks ago.Nigel Hamilton, chairman of Haemophilia Northern Ireland, said: “We are entitled to justice and we will have justice.”In a message to the IBCA, Mr Hamilton added: “Work with us like never before and ensure that we are not just listened to, but we are also heard.”Mary Grindley, 76, who has been campaigning for 45 years, called on the compensation authority to set a timeline for “payments to estates”, adding: “It’s as though the people who have died have been totally forgotten.”The grandmother gave up teaching in 1991 to look after her husband, John, who contracted HIV and hepatitis C while receiving treatment for haemophilia and who died from Aids in 1994 at the age of 41.More than 30,000 people in the UK were infected with HIV and hepatitis C after they were given contaminated blood and blood products between the 1970s and early 1990s.Some 3,000 people died as a result and survivors are living with lifelong health implications.In her October budget, Chancellor Rachel Reeves allocated £11.8 billion to compensate victims, administered by the IBCA.The IBCA said that, as of May 6, 677 people have been asked to start their claim and 106 payments have been made, totalling more than £96 million.Officials from the IBCA will give evidence on Thursday.', 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Infected blood victims may die before payout\\nENTITIES: Infected Blood Inquiry, Sir Brian Langstaff, Nick Thomas-Symonds, IBCA, Rachel Reeves, Andrew Evans, Gary Webster, Carolyn Challis, Bill Wright, Alan Burgess, Nigel Hamilton, Mary Grindley\\nEVENT: Infected blood scandal victims may die before compensation is paid, government admits during inquiry hearing.

The party won most votes, most seats and overall control of most councils.True, the party's share of the votes cast across all 23 councils where elections took place on Thursday was no more than 31%. So despite doing well, it secured far from a majority of those voting.However, its performance was enough to put Reform well ahead of the Conservatives – who traditionally dominate county councils - on 23%, the Liberal Democrats on 17% and Labour on 14% when you tally up the votes in those parts of England that went to the polls on Thursday.Local elections 2025 in maps and chartsAt the 2024 general election Reform secured 14% of the vote but just 5 out of 650 seats at Westminster. But crucially, being ahead of everyone else in 2025 ensured the first-past-the-post election system helped Reform.Its tally of 677 council seats represented 41% of all those being contested on Thursday, 10 points above its share of the vote, a nod to both the nature of the voting system and Reform's ability to cluster votes. That boost helped the party win control of as many as 10 councils, something that Reform's predecessor, UKIP, never managed at the height of its popularity in the run up to the 2015 general election.In Staffordshire, Reform won 72% of the seats on 41% of the vote. In Kent, 37% of the vote delivered it 70% of the seats, while in Derbyshire the same share was rewarded with 66% of all the councillors.Instead of insulating Conservative and Labour from the impact of a third-party challenge, as it has done so often before, first past the post exacerbated their losses. In both cases Reform took nearly half of all the seats those parties were defending.The map above is the most detailed local election mapping ever produced by the BBC. It details the strength of the Reform vote in every ward that voted on Thursday and shows support for Reform varied considerably.That variation has some striking and important features. They suggest the party was particularly popular among those who voted for Brexit in 2016 and for Boris Johnson in 2019 - and that Reform's success cannot simply be dismissed as a short-lived protest vote.Brexit still a fault lineReflecting the party's anti-EU stance, Reform did much better in wards that voted heavily for Leave in the 2016 EU referendum than it did in wards that backed Remain.In wards where more than 65% voted Leave in 2016, Reform won on average as much as 45% of the vote. In contrast, in places where a majority backed Remain, only 19% voted for Reform.Although talked about much less by politicians nowadays, Brexit is still an important fault line in our politics. Reform's appeal is significantly concentrated among those who believe the Brexit decision was right.Even so, the fact that even in pro-Remain wards the party was able to win as much as a fifth of the vote was testimony to the scale of the swing that it enjoyed on Thursday.PA MediaReform's successful campaign saw it win 677 English council seatsThe Brexit division is also evident in the demographic character of the places where Reform did best and those where it did less well.University graduates and those in professional and managerial jobs were least likely to vote for Brexit in 2016. Reform found it more difficult to do well in places where they are most numerous.Reform won 39% of the vote in heavily working-class wards but only 19% in the most middle-class ones.The map shows Reform's highest vote of all (65.1%) was in Thornley & Wheatley Hill, situated in Tony Blair's former Sedgefield constituency in Durham and once a centre of coal mining. Next highest was Romney Marsh in Kent and Chadsmoor in Staffordshire.PA MediaReform performed best in areas that have sometimes been characterised in the wake of the Brexit referendum as 'left-behind' BritainMeanwhile, support for the party averaged 43% in wards where more than half of adults have few, if any, educational qualifications. In contrast, it polled just 19% where more than two in five have a degree.Reform's lowest share of the vote, 3.7%, was in the Parks ward in Oxford, situated in the heart of the famous university city.Immigration is also a key issue for Reform. However, this perhaps makes the party less appealing to those from a minority background.Certainly, on average the party only polled 22% in wards where more than one in five identify as other than 'white', compared with a tally of 33% in places where more than 95% told the 2021 Census that they were 'white'.In summary, Reform did best in what has sometimes been characterised in the wake of the Brexit referendum as 'left-behind' Britain – places that have profited less from globalisation and university expansion and where a more conservative outlook on immigration is more common.A problem for the two main partiesNeither the Conservatives nor Labour are likely to recover from the drubbing they received on Thursday unless they can appeal more to this slice of Britain.Although polls indicate that Reform finds it easier to win over former Conservative voters than their Labour counterparts, Reform's average share of the vote was strikingly just as high in wards that Labour were defending as it was in places that the Conservatives were trying to retain.The party on average won 32% of the vote in previously Labour wards and 32% in Conservative ones.ReutersReform won the Runcorn and Helsby by-election by just six votesAs a result, Labour lost seats to Reform at much the same rate as the Conservatives, a pattern that cost Labour control of the one council they were defending, Doncaster.In contrast, Reform's advance was more muted in wards that the Liberal Democrats and the Greens were defending. The party's average share in these wards was just 22%. As a result, Reform had relatively little success in taking seats from these two parties.Liberal Democrat and Green wards – unlike many Conservative and Labour ones - are heavily populated by university graduates.Reform's success on Thursday undoubtedly reflects the mood of an electorate that still has little faith in the Conservatives and which now is disappointed by Labour's performance in office.However, it is evidently proving most popular in a very distinctive part of Britain that overturned the political tables a decade ago in voting for Brexit - and which now has done so again.John Curtice is Professor of Politics, University of Strathclyde, and Senior Fellow, National Centre for Social Research and 'The UK in a Changing Europe'.Analysis by Patrick English, Steve Fisher, Robert Ford, and Lotte HargraveMap produced by Libby Rogers, Muskeen Liddar, Jess Carr and Callum ThomsonMore from InDepthBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

The food in question? Two boxes of popular children's snack foods from Costco.Are the snacks especially healthy or nutritious? No. But are they causing ADHD? Organic Tarzan,\\xa0who describes himself as a 'Marine Corps veteran with a background in kinesiology', is convinced they do play a role. But the scientific data is lacking.The comments sections of her videos are full of mothers sharing stories of how\\xa0 doctors tried to 'push' medication on their children with ADHD, only for their array of symptoms to disappear thanks to\\xa0dietary changes.'They wanted me to medicate my eight year old for his ADHD,' says one.\\xa0'Instead I changed his diet to gluten-free and his behaviour changed in three days.''Big Pharma won't get its hands on my kids when I can cure their behaviour with diet alone,' agreed another mother.It's understandable that parents would want to try every possible avenue before giving their children stimulant medication like Ritalin and Vyvanse. Seeing anecdotal accounts of miraculous three-day turnarounds no doubt offers hope.But there is scant scientific backing of these claims, and even the most legitimate of the 'ADHD diets' comes with a big caveat. One 'treatment' that has been back in the spotlight thanks to TikTok and Instagram In classrooms, at coffee catch-ups between parents, in doctor's offices and, notably, all over social media, one condition has had an explosion in awareness in recent years: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.'ADHD is a formal neuro-developmental disorder where there are excessive and pervasive impacts on inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity and emotional regulation,' explains Dr Tim Jones, the Chair of Child and Young Person's Health at the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP).\\xa0'It manifests in many different ways across kids and adults.'In 2018, about 186,000 Australians received ADHD medication (1.4 million prescriptions dispensed). By 2022, this more than doubled to 414,000 people (3.2 million prescriptions).According to Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme records, the number of Australians on ADHD medication grew by almost 300 per cent over the past decade, reaching about 470,000 people in 2022–23.With an increase in both awareness and diagnosis, the conversation around alternatives to medication, particularly in children, has been reignited.For many 'ADHD mums', dietary changes are the most common pathway.An alarming number of the four-million-plus posts\\xa0associated with the tag #ADHD on TikTok centre on diets that users claim can\\xa0'cure' the neurodevelopmental disorder, as well as the 'wrong' foods that supposedly cause it in the first place. Dr Tim Jones says he's aware of the Feingold diet 'but only through patients showing me their social media feeds' The Feingold diet, first introduced more than half a century ago, has made a comeback recently thanks to TikTok and Instagram. It is an elimination diet thought to reverse some of the symptoms of ADHD in children specifically.Developed in the 1970s by Dr Benjamin Feingold, who hypothesised that artificial colours, flavours and certain preservatives could contribute to hyperactivity in children, the Feingold diet involves eliminating these additives, along with salicylates (naturally occurring compounds found in some fruits and vegetables), from a child's diet to see if symptoms improve.\\xa0The diet soon gained popularity among parents of children with ADHD, some of whom reported improvements in behaviour. However, studies have found limited and inconsistent evidence to support its effectiveness, with only a small subset of children seeming to show any measurable improvement from following the plan. The Feingold diet involves eliminating certain additives, sugary food and food colourings - but does it actually help? While the Feingold diet may work for those children who are particularly sensitive to food additives - and it is worth trying under medical supervision if you believe your child falls into this category - experts warn parents must manage their expectations.Studies suggest only between five and 10 per cent of kids with ADHD experience worsening symptoms due to food additives like artificial colours and preservatives.That leaves up to 90 per cent of diagnosed children who do not fall within this\\xa0subset and won't benefit from this restrictive and hard-to-follow diet.These numbers, of course, haven't stopped social media creators from promoting Feingold as 'the cure' for ADHD while accusing 'Big Pharma' of destroying the\\xa0diet's credibility so they can push stimulants on children.Dr Jones says he's aware of the Feingold diet 'but only through patients showing me their social media feeds'.While studies have found a link between certain food additives and hyperactivity in children (with or without ADHD), Dr Jones adds: 'We have absolutely no evidence to support the use of the Feingold or any other elimination diets in ADHD, and more broadly, we have strong evidence that they do not work.'The RACGP does not endorse dietary modification\\xa0as a useful medical intervention to treat ADHD, beyond the usual recommendation of following a healthy, balanced diet.Dr\\xa0Jones avoids dietary 'names or fads' when dealing with ADHD parents and instead likes to examine what specific foods may be making symptoms worse.'Genuinely, every family I work with just wants what's best for their child,' he says.\\xa0'There are kids who are getting excessive exposure to sugar or caffeine or some of these other food additives, and it is exacerbating their symptoms.'It's therefore very reasonable to then look at working on healthy eating as a whole family, in those cases.'Having said that, in no way would we say this is what's caused their [ADHD], and in no way would we be promising that diet [can] make a difference. We're more just talking about the general principles of living well and living in good health being broadly of use to all.'Dr Jones says his greatest concern about parents exploring alternatives like the Feingold diet is that they may be refusing or delaying evidence-based treatment.'We know early intervention works,' he explains.'If you've got these kids with these vulnerabilities, and you adopt behavioral strategies and teaching strategies to support them engaging in their learning and in their self-development early, that is going to make the biggest difference.'Dr Jones adds that for parents who are reluctant to try medication as a first course of action, they can rest assured there are other evidence-based interventions that can and should be tried first.'If a child is under six in Australia, the first-line interventions are behavioural interventions,' he explains.'These interventions look at how that child communicates with their family, how they engage in their world and how they are supported in the school environment, and medication is not endorsed as a first-line strategy in those children.'Dr Jones says three factors have contributed to the rise in ineffective alternative solutions being touted as viable treatments for ADHD in children.\\xa0Firstly, the overwhelming amount of available information online; secondly, a struggling education system that lacks the resources to give children the right kind of engagement in learning; and thirdly, the lack of accessible continuity of care. 'When I was a kid, my parents, who were very experienced parents, still really found it very challenging. But they could get into a GP easily,' he says.'They were sometimes seeing the GP for weekly support. And now we've got a situation where so many families don't have that long-term relationship with a trusted GP to just go through all the thick and thin of life, and help you make those good decisions as you move through parenting your kids.'\", 'location': 'AUS', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: ADHD diet claims versus medical advice\\nENTITIES: TikTok, Instagram, Dr Tim Jones, Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, RACGP, Dr Benjamin Feingold\\nEVENT: Mothers claim dietary changes, specifically the Feingold diet, can cure ADHD in children, despite lack of scientific evidence and warnings from doctors.\\nCONTEXT: Social media promotes unproven ADHD diet as cure.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 51471, 'sourceId': 12666, 'url': 'https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/destiny2-renegades-star-wars-35183089', 'title': 'Destiny 2’s Renegades expansion is Star Wars themed as community is left torn', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T10:00:05.000Z', 'content': 'TechGamingDestiny 2Destiny 2\\'s new saga was revealed last night, but fans are torn on Renegades, a Star Wars inspired expansion that\\'s slated to launch in December 2025 — here\\'s all we learned11:00, 07 May 2025Fans are torn over RenegadesYesterday saw Destiny 2 developer Bungie reveal not one, not two, but four expansions for the long-running loot shooter starting with Edge of Fate in July.For a studio that only just revealed its Marathon reboot, it\\'s an impressive release cadence, but December\\'s planned Renegades expansion has got people talking more than any other.\\u200cTeased in The Edge of Fate reveal stream, the planned expansion features some familiar sights and sounds.

They are objects waiting to be whipped out at dinner, shown to friends and then refilled once done. Inside the joy continues, bullets, often embossed (Prada Beauty lip products epitomise this - stamped with the brands’ famous Saffiano leather and Re-Nylon finishes), formulas richly pigmented and cleverly named, packed with nourishing actives that promise to plump, perfect and deliver unrivalled staying power. Parties? Cocktails? Kissing? They can survive all three. The ritual and luxury is real. L’Oréal Paris All this said, there is, in my opinion, just as much magic - sometimes more - that comes in affordable, high-street lippie form. The thrill of discovering a hidden beauty with a price tag that allows for wild experimentation, because it doesn't gobble up your whole pay check. Want to try cherry? Violet? Coral? Brick? Go ahead and do it without regret. Moreover, the formulas of these more democratic offerings have evolved beyond belief, regularly rivalling their couture contemporaries in pigmentation, texture and wear. Some (sshhh), even originate from the same factories and production lines. So while high-end is all about ritual and aspiration, high street is fun and fabulous and gratifying. Plus - most importantly - it delivers.And I’m clearly not alone in this opinion. This week Kendall Jenner, Heidi Klum, Halle Berry and Tracee Ellis Ross all took to the Met Gala’s narcissus-scattered red carpet wearing one of my all-time favourite lipsticks - L’Oréal Paris Colour Riche Satin - a product long-heroed by makeup artists, those in the know and - well - me, that comes in at £9.99. Heidi and Halle wore the muted pink Worth It. For Kendall it was shade Worth It Medium a deep, rosy nude, and Tracee chose a true red. My picks from the range F.Y.I are Le Bordeaux, a brilliant, universally flattering blue red and the hot pink Laprune. Sure, the click isn’t so loud, or the packaging all that heavy, but with a whopping 70-shade range, epic pigments and a, Omega 3 and Vitamin E-enriched formula, for under a tenner there is literally nothing not to love. Trust me - and the A-listers - no one will know that this lipstick didn't cost your daily paycheck, because it’s just so good. Do - if you wish - like Kendall and dress your shade of choice with a couture Torishéju suit and Chopard diamonds, saving the change you didn’t spend on that high end alternative for a slap-up supper, or new pair of shoes.

Stories of these unannounced visits popped up around the country — agents who attempted to gain access to two elementary schools in Los Angeles; agents who showed up “five deep and armed” at the home of an immigration lawyer’s 19-year-old client in Virginia; agents who interviewed a terrified 16-year-old Honduran girl at her uncle’s house in Washington state.Department of Homeland Security officials have said the welfare checks are part of an ongoing effort to ensure that unaccompanied children “are safe and not being exploited, abused, and sex trafficked.” Immigrant advocates say some visits have led to children being forced to leave the country with their deported parents or being removed from their sponsors and placed in federal custody.Advocates point to the case of a 17-year-old Honduran in Hawaii whose older brother had been detained by federal agents. The boy was transported to a facility for unaccompanied youths in California.“This is just par for the course for an administration that has staked their claim on making life so incredibly difficult for immigrants at large that they think people will leave and not come to the U.S.,” said Jen Smyers, former chief of staff under the Biden administration for the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is responsible for the care of unaccompanied children. More to Read Fear of the welfare checks “drives people underground, increases exploitation and trafficking,” Smyers said. “And they’re doing it with this perverse narrative by saying that they care about kids. But all they’re doing is wrecking these kids’ lives.” Those under review by the Trump administration are among the roughly 450,000 children who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border without their parents and were released to sponsors during President Biden’s term.Children who arrive unaccompanied by a parent are placed in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is under the Department of Health and Human Services. The department is required to screen adult sponsors who volunteer to care for the children, usually their parents or other relatives. Shortly after President Trump took office, his administration formulated a multi-agency plan to track down unaccompanied children, investigate whether they are being subjected to human trafficking and deport those who are removable. An internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement memo, obtained by The Times, details the four-phase operation.The memo indicates that agents should prioritize youths who didn’t show up for an immigration hearing, those whom the government has not been able to contact since they were released to sponsors, those who are considered a threat to public safety and those with deportation orders. The agency is also looking closely at youths released from federal custody to sponsors who are not blood relatives, including so-called super sponsors who have taken in more than three unaccompanied children.The sponsorship program has been beset by problems in recent years. The federal government has failed to properly vet some sponsors, according to a federal watchdog report from last year. Thousands of children rapidly released from government shelters were later exploited by major companies. Last month, a federal grand jury indicted a man on allegations that he lured a 14-year-old girl from Guatemala to the U.S. and falsely claimed she was his sister to gain custody as her sponsor.About 100 children have been removed from their sponsors this year and returned to federal custody, the Associated Press reported, and 450 cases with complaints have been referred to federal law enforcement. The review of sponsorships under the Trump administration is being led by two branches of ICE: Enforcement and Removal Operations, or ERO, and Homeland Security Investigations, or HSI. Along with combating human trafficking, the effort aims to identify possible candidates for deportation. Referring to unaccompanied children as “UAC,” the memo states: “ERO officers should remember they are to enforce final orders of removal, where possible, and HSI will pursue criminal options for UAC who have committed crimes.” The Homeland Security and Health and Human Services departments did not respond to a request for comment.Over the last two months, immigration attorneys say, agents have attempted to intimidate minors. In one instance in California, underage clients answered the door to find agents in casual wear asking about their mother and whether they had a job. Another family reported to their attorney that HSI agents arrived while the minor was at school, yet the agents returned four times in one day looking for the student.The tactic puts in jeopardy sponsors who lack legal authorization to be in the country or live in mixed-status households, said Karina Ramos, a managing attorney at the Los Angeles-based Immigrant Defenders Law Center. “It’s definitely going to have a chilling effect on a sponsor, if they know there are going to be immigration officers questioning their status,” she said.The case of the teenager in Hawaii began April 9 when his older brother was arrested on suspicion of misdemeanor illegal entry, according to someone with knowledge of the case.The teen had entered the country unaccompanied and was previously in federal custody in Texas. He was released to his older brother’s care in 2023. According to the person with knowledge of the case, when the teen was apprehended last month, agents considered whether they could deport him along with his brother.After his older brother was apprehended, the 17-year-old was placed in a facility for unaccompanied youths in California. Hawaii has no Office of Refugee Resettlement facilities.Before he was transported to California, teachers who knew the student attempted to aid his release, according to local advocates and the Honolulu Civil Beat. The teachers carried documents showing his aunt could take custody of him if he was released to her.Advocates said there are intersecting operations in Hawaii — welfare checks on unaccompanied children and enforcement actions against deportable immigrants. At least four immigrant children in two separate cases were recently removed with their parents, who were targeted for deportation, advocates said. “Having a parallel directive to remove grown-ups from children is never in the best interest of the child,” said Mary Miller Flowers, director of policy and legislative affairs at the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights. “So it feels like it’s a euphemism for enforcement actions.”In other parts of the country, young immigrants and their adult sponsors are grappling with what the welfare checks could spell for them.In Houston, Alexa Sendukas, managing attorney for the Galveston-Houston Immigrant Representation Project, said 21 clients have experienced welfare checks in recent weeks. Those who let agents inside their homes told her that agents walked from room to room, asking questions and taking photos.In a meeting last week, HSI agents told Sendukas that they had rescued two children from a trafficking situation in the Houston area and found a sponsor who was producing child exploitation material. But she remains skeptical.“We’ve heard the example of the Hawaii case,” she said, adding that advocates worry that agents doing welfare checks are gathering information they can use in the future. Referring to the ICE memo, she said, “The guidance suggests a multiphase initiative — what does the next phase look like?” In San Diego, federal agents recently conducted a wellness check at the residence of a girl represented by immigration attorney Ian Seruelo. She is in the process of receiving special immigration juvenile status, he said.A day after the wellness check, as the girl was visiting her parents, who live at a different location, federal agents stopped them while they were driving to church and detained them for several hours, Seruelo said. The parents have no criminal record but are undocumented, and their status was probably known to officials, Seruelo said, because they had been in deportation proceedings that were dropped. Neither the girl nor her parents are in custody, he said.Seruelo said he found the timing of the parents’ detention suspect. “I think they were using the wellness check to get information about the parents,” he said. Smyers, the former Health and Human Services official, said the public safety and border security justifications noted in the ICE memo about tracking down unaccompanied children are the same justifications used by Stephen Miller, the federal official and mastermind behind the separation of thousands of families at the southern border during President Trump’s first term.“The American public should be just as galvanized against this as they were to family separation at the border,” she said.Castillo reported from Washington and Gomez from Los Angeles.', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Welfare checks spark deportation fears for migrant children\\nENTITIES: Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Department of Homeland Security, Office of Refugee Resettlement, Trump administration, Biden administration\\nEVENT: Immigration agents conduct welfare checks on unaccompanied minors, raising concerns about deportations of the children, their sponsors, and their families.\\nCONTEXT: Welfare checks on unaccompanied minors raise deportation concerns.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 52768, 'sourceId': 12701, 'url': 'https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/declan-rice-arsenal-fc-trophy-vow-champions-league-exit-b1226472.html', 'title': 'Declan Rice makes defiant new Arsenal trophy vow after Champions League exit', 'publishDate': '2025-05-08T00:29:42.000Z', 'content': 'A deflated Declan Rice insisted that a heartbreaking Champions League semi-final defeat by Paris Saint-Germain would not “define” this Arsenal team, vowing they would bounce back stronger again in pursuit of trophies.The Gunners saw hopes of reaching the final of European football’s elite club competition for the first time since 2006 cruelly dashed at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday night, failing to overturn a 1-0 first-leg deficit against PSG as they went down 2-1 despite a spirited performance.It was the latest in a now long line of near-misses for Arsenal, who have fallen away in the Premier League title race for two consecutive seasons as well as losing all of their last four semi-final ties under manager Mikel Arteta without winning any of the individual legs.It is five years since they last lifted any major silverware, with Arteta having so far not managed to add to the FA Cup secured in his first season in the job back in 2020, aside from two Community Shield triumphs.But Rice is adamant that these setbacks will help Arsenal achieve their goals in the end.\"It’s gutting, such a dominant start,” the England midfielder told TNT Sports. “If you score one of them chances probably in the first 15 or 20 minutes, then the game completely changes. It’s just the small margins in football.“Two mistakes from us, two goals for them. With the chances we missed, it just felt like it wasn’t meant to be. “We gave it absolutely everything, this competition you’re either in or you’re out. Over the two legs we could\\'ve scored three or four goals to be honest but [Gianluigi] Donnarumma has been unbelievable and you’ve got to look at the small margins. It just obviously wasn\\'t meant to be.\"In life in general, sometimes you have to lose a few in order to win and you have to overcome some of these setbacks to mentally grow as a person, as a player and as a group.“We\\'re going through that stage at the minute after a few losses in terms of losing out on the league and coming close in the Champions League in back-to-back years.“We\\'re growing as a team, as people, but we need to keep pushing and keep believing. This is why we play this sport, there are going to be setbacks along the way.“PSG have obviously gone through tonight, we\\'re absolutely gutted but this isn’t going to define us for sure. We\\'re going to be back and when we get our players back who have been out for a very long time, we are going to be a much stronger outfit so we’ve got to keep going.”Rice admitted that it has been a struggle for Arsenal to play so much of the season without so many key players, but said they fully believed they could complete their comeback mission in Paris.\"It\\'s tough,” he continued. “We\\'ve done the whole season without five or six of our best players and to be where we are and do what we\\'ve done has been unbelievable. I fully stand by that.“In the end the group of players who have gone out there have given it absolutely everything, the whole squad has, even the players that flew over with us tonight that have been injured, every staff member. “Everyone fully believed and I think you could see that from the first whistle, how much we believed we could win and go out there and put on a performance.“On another night we maybe score two or three, it was just that first 20 minutes where they score and we don\\'t take our chances and it’s a real kick in the teeth.“We’ll assess it, we\\'ll be back. Three games left, it\\'s been a really long season, we really, really wanted this one, but we keep pushing because this is why we play this sport. We want to win and do the best we can.\"On continuing their run without a trophy under Arteta, Rice added: “We\\'re all desperate for it. That\\'s why we play football, we want to win trophies, we want to be at the pinnacle, winning stuff.“For whatever reason, these last two years in the cup competitions and the Premier League, it hasn\\'t been meant to be.“We\\'ve been really, really close and it\\'s obviously not good enough, because Arsenal are a club that deserve to be winning trophies and deserve to be pushing and there’s not a lot more we can really be doing.“Sometimes in life you have to go through these small losses in order to win big. That’s what a lot of these big superstars have done in the past, they have all suffered defeats to then come out on top.“It hurts, you see the boys in there, the manager. It’s tough, it’s a semi-final. We wanted to be in Munich and it’s obviously not meant to be but this doesn\\'t define us and we\\'ll be back for sure.\"Rice’s midfield colleague Martin Odegaard, meanwhile, challenged Arsenal to channel the pain of their semi-final loss into a force for good moving forward.\"We gave it a proper go,” the captain said. “I think we started the game really well. We were on the front foot, had the momentum, a few big moments and chances but in the end it wasn\\'t enough.“Between the boxes we did really well, inside the boxes over the two games we weren\\'t good enough. Credit to their goalkeeper as well who made some amazing saves. It wasn\\'t enough and that\\'s painful.\"In the boxes, especially today what we did with the ball between the boxes, how we dominated, how we took the control of the game from the start and created some big moments. We were not strong enough and sharp enough in front of the goals and I think that\\'s where we lost it.\"It\\'s painful, very painful. We wanted to do the big thing, it was a big goal in the league and also here in the Champions League. Massive disappointment but we have to stay strong and stay together. We have to take the lessons, take that pain and use it and come back stronger.\"We have to learn from this. We did a lot of good things but it\\'s not enough. Especially in front of the goals, it’s where the games are decided and that\\'s where we have to be even sharper and get more out of all the good things we did. That’s where we have to improve and use this pain in a good way and come back stronger.”', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Arsenal vows to return stronger after defeat\\nENTITIES: Declan Rice, Arsenal, Paris Saint-Germain, Mikel Arteta, Martin Odegaard, Gianluigi Donnarumma\\nEVENT: Arsenal lost 2-1 to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League semi-final, failing to overturn a first-leg deficit, with Rice vowing the team will bounce back stronger.\\nCONTEXT: Arsenal's Champions League exit marks another trophy-less season under Arteta, fueling determination for future success.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 52911, 'sourceId': 12706, 'url': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-14686647/Man-United-handed-major-boost-key-Athletic-Bilbao-trio-ruled-Europa-League-semi-final-clash-Old-Trafford.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490', 'title': 'Man United handed major boost as key Athletic Bilbao trio are ruled out of Europa League semi-final...', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T20:25:11.000Z', 'content': \"09:49, 07 May 2025, updated\\n21:25, 07 May 2025\\nBy\\nSAM BROOKES\\nAthletic Bilbao have released their squad list for tomorrow night's matchThey will be without three key players for their match with United at Old TraffordLISTEN NOW: It's All Kicking Off!

Arsenal need to sign players for the here and now to win the Premier League... so, should they sign Harry Kane?\\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola and his wife Cristina Serra 'are still estranged' and 'will remain so' unless anything dramatic occurs, reports in Spain say.It was claimed last month the couple were trying to give their marriage a second chance after Guardiola and his fashion entrepreneur wife spent three days together at their former Barcelona marital home over Easter.It was the second time since news of their shock split became public in January that the former Barcelona footballer had travelled to the Catalan capital and spent time with Cristina.Barcelona-based newspaper El Nacional said after the second reunion they were prepared to 'give each another chance' and claimed 'all was not lost in their marriage.'But the journalists who broke the story of their shock split have shot down the chances of a fresh start for Pep and Cristina after their decision to call time on their 30-year relationship.Lorena Vasquez, one of a duo of well-respected Spanish showbiz reporters who call themselves the Mamarazzis, went on a Spanish TV show in February to say they had launched divorce proceedings which were 'amicable' because they were using the same lawyer. Pep Guariola and his wife Cristina Serra are reportedly estranged and will remain so They reportedly spent three days together in Barcelona in April in a bid to save their marriage Manchester City manager Guardiola and Serra split earlier this year after 30 years together She also linked the split again to the Man City manager's unexpected decision last November to renew his contract with the Premier League club until 2027.On Wednesday, shooting down possibilities of a reunion, Lorena's colleague Laura Fa said on the Mamarrazis podcast: 'It's been speculated recently that there could exist a possibility of a reconciliation because Pep Guardiola had been seen at his house in Barcelona with the woman who is still his wife and their youngest daughter.'We had already explained that despite separating they would continue to see each other as a family.'That's why after separating Pep and Cristina went to the theatre with their daughter.'As the talk of conciliation was so strong we have continued to investigate.'Lorena added: 'A lot of this has come about one of the visits Pep made to Barcelona when a photographer managed to get a photo of him.'We were able to confirm Pep Guardiola spent three days in the city and slept for at least two nights in the house in Barcelona he bought with Cristina where their daughter still lives.'What we know is that the separation is continuing its course and there's no reconciliation and as far as Cristina is concerned there's no attempt at reconciliation.\\xa0 Guardiola's decision to sign an two-year deal at Man City reportedly contributed to the split Guardiola and Serra pictured with daughter Maria after City won the Treble in Istanbul 'She was the one who sparked the split and gave Pep a sort of ultimatum and he could still be trying to come to terms with the situation.'Laura said: 'The house Pep spends time in when he is in Barcelona is still the family home and will be the place he comes to when he returns to the city to see his children or when there are family events here.'Pep and Cristina continue to have a good relationship.'We don't have many more details about the couple's intimacy but we can confirm that they are still separated and there is no reconciliation on the horizon.'The thing is that when there's a good relationship between a couple who have split, it can sometimes cause confusion.'Lorena Vazquez claimed on Spanish TV 'Y Ahora Sonsoles' on Antena 3 channel in February: 'The divorce is being prepared conscientiously and they have left it in the hands of people they really trust.'What surprises me the most is that both of them have the same lawyer who is arranging the whole thing.'They want it to be amicable for the sake of their children.'\\xa0 Guardiola and Serra pictured attending Wimbledon at the All England Club in July 2024 Serra has regularly been seen on the pitch celebrating with her husband after City win major trophies She added: 'As you can imagine money is not going to be an issue and they are now agreeing on the initial terms to make sure this separation is the most cordial possible.'She went on to say, when asked why she thought Pep was still wearing his wedding ring: 'It's surprising he's still wearing his wedding ring and I wouldn't be able to tell you if it's a symbol he wants to carry on wearing as a homage to his marriage or as an open door to reconciliation, because what we're being told is that he would perhaps be more open to that than his wife.'What I'm also being told is that Cristina is suffering with the fact her name has come to the fore.'She has been a person who has always been in the background who never wanted to be known or recognised as the partner of Pep Guardiola although she is very proud to be married to him.'But seeing herself in glossy magazines and seeing herself as the object of the tabloid press is something she doesn't like at all.'But we know they are very happy that the news has finally come out, or rather than happy I would say relieved.'We had little information when we first came out with the news but we knew it was true, so much so that they themselves have now transmitted the news to all their close friends because initially they wanted to keep information back about the details of the separation.'They are still keeping that information back but they are confirming to anyone that asks them that they are separated.\\xa0 Serra attending a Bundesliga match when Guardiola was manager of Bayern Munich The couple pictured at the pro-am at the PGA Championship in Wentworth, Surrey in 2018 Serra attended the FIFA Best Awards in London alongside Guardiola in January of last year\\n'Although they don't like being protagonists in anything, there is certain relief on their part that finally their split has come out, there are no third people involved, and that it's down to Pep's contract renovation with Manchester City that became very burdensome and was also a surprise for Cristina.Cristina insisted she was 'feeling great' in her first comments since news of their split emerged in January as she was pictured shopping alone in Barcelona.She opted for silence when she was subsequently asked by a Spanish reporter about the cause of their break-up and has refused to comment whenever she has been approached since.The couple's eldest daughter Maria opened up on her parents' lessons about love after becoming the first family member to speak since the shock news of their split.The pretty influencer and fashionista said in a Spanish magazine interview published around the same time her dad's break-up with Cristina emerged: 'My parents have always advised me to find what I am passionate about.'They encourage me to try new things, to accept failure and to keep searching until I find my calling, because when I do, full dedication will come naturally.'They also remind me that the most important thing in life is to love and be loved.' The 24-year-old London-based beauty went on to tell Vanity Fair Spain: 'In the end it all comes down to feeling loved.'Even in situations where we feel out of place, they tell me to listen carefully to others, there is always something valuable to learn from each person we meet.'\", 'location': 'N/A', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Guardiola and Serra still estranged, no reconciliation\\nENTITIES: Pep Guardiola, Cristina Serra, Manchester City\\nEVENT: Reports indicate Pep Guardiola and Cristina Serra remain estranged despite reconciliation rumors.\\nCONTEXT: Guardiola's contract renewal reportedly strained the marriage.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 52908, 'sourceId': 12706, 'url': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-14688189/Alejandro-Garnacho-Manchester-United-Ruben-Amorim.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490', 'title': 'Alejandro Garnacho finally addresses his Man United future with Argentine star linked with £70m move...', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T20:56:55.000Z', 'content': \"Alejandro Garnacho finally addresses his Man United future with Argentine star linked with £70m move away from Old Trafford after 'very difficult' start under Ruben Amorim\\n16:38, 07 May 2025, updated\\n21:56, 07 May 2025\\nBy\\nCHRIS WHEELER\\nThe winger has been linked with a move away but is under contract until 2028\\xa0LISTEN NOW: It's All Kicking Off!

But I have a contract here until 2028, so I'm happy here,' he said.Garnacho had a difficult start under Ruben Amorim.

Arsenal need to sign players for the here and now to win the Premier League... so, should they sign Harry Kane?\\nThe green rectangle of plastic grass glistened with no hint of the demons said to be lurking within and the Bodo/Glimt players fizzed passes about on a surface slick with Arctic drizzle.Around them, workers were busy adorning the Aspmyra Stadium with the final trimmings for its biggest night, fixing UEFA branding in the appropriate areas and running TV cables around the simple stands.Beyond that, the stillness of a Norwegian fishing town where day broke at 3am, the calls of the gulls, the rumble of a tractor spreading rubber crumb over an artificial training pitch and the occasional fighter jet tearing through the sky on a training exercise.Little else stirred in Bodo as Tottenham descended. The Champions League determined its two finalists amid the trembling passion of the San Siro and Parc des Princes. There will be 80,000 inside Old Trafford willing Manchester United to beat Athletic Bilbao.Here, the anticipation came with a little Scandinavian understatement. With yellow flags on display outside buildings, fluttering from lampposts, on display in the windows of shops and porches.'It is a historic football match and we want the main role,' said Bodo/Glimt boss Kjetil Knutsen. His team trail 3-1 after the first leg but a late goal in London fuelled hope and they have faith in the Aspmyra with its League Two vibe and capacity of 8,000. 'We are at home, we have the town behind us,' Knutsen added. Spurs are gearing up for their crucial Europa League semi-final second leg against Bodo/Glimt Ange Postecoglou's Tottenham are taking a 3-1 aggregate lead into the second leg in Norway Spurs will play at Bodo/Glimt's Aspmyra Stadium (above), which has an artificial surface Midfielder Jens Petter Hauge, who joined AC Milan from Bodo in 2020 and won the Europa League with Eintracht Frankfurt before returning to his hometown club last year, said: 'No matter where you go or who you meet, in the garage or the mall, everyone is looking forward to it and everyone says they've tried to get tickets and it's impossible.'Tottenham dominated last week and were worth their lead, despite disparaging post-match comments from Bodo right-back Fredrik Sjovold who claimed the Premier League team's attempts to press them into mistakes were 'ræva', meaning 'very bad' in its most polite translation, and that he had played against better in Norwegian football.Knutsen brushed it aside, putting it down to Sjovold's 'inexperience' and yet it has become a talking point in Norway, where there is a feeling that Ange Postecoglou's team were nothing special and are now without James Maddison, ruled out for three months with a knee injury he suffered in the first leg.Bodo, with key players including captain Patrick Berg back from suspension, believe they are not out of this tie, especially if they score first in the Aspmyra, where the home record is so formidable.In 10 home ties in this European campaign, which started in July in the Champions League qualifiers, the Norwegian champions have won nine, including victories against established clubs such as Lazio, Olympiacos, Twente, Besiktas and Red Star. Three years ago, they beat Roma 6-1 after knocking out Postecoglou's Celtic.The artificial pitch has been criticised, and Knutsen hit back, saying: 'We are a good football team first and foremost. Like most teams, we are better at home than away. The grass we have is what we play on. It's due to the climate. And the more you play on it the better you get. At home, over time, we have learned to trust in ourselves. It's a good pitch and good players can easily adapt.'The last time Tottenham played on an artificial pitch was in the FA Cup at Tamworth, when they needed extra-time to see off fifth-tier opposition, and Postecoglou opted against using artificial surfaces at the training ground before travelling to Norway, claiming there was little point because they were all different.Goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario, who didn't play at Tamworth, said it was probably five years since he played on one, but nobody appeared too perturbed as they trained in Bodo last night. Bodo/Glimt's record at home has been formidable and they won't think they're out of the tie Postecoglou vowed that his side are fazed by the pitch, atmosphere or conditions in Norway The Spurs boss will be without James Maddison, who is ruled out for the rest of the season The story behind Bodo/Glimt's name Bodo is the name of the town in northern Norway and Glimt means flash.\\xa0When they were formed in 1916 they were simply known as Glimt but added the Bodo in the middle of the 20th Century because another team had the same nickname.\\xa0Originally, they used a dash between the words but changed it to the unique forward slash because the dash led to confusion when the fixtures were printed on the pools.\\xa0Since their rise to international prominence after winning their first Norwegian title in 2020, Bodo/Glimt has become one of the most recognisable names in European football. 'It's obviously different,' said Postecoglou. 'Whether it's the pitch, the atmosphere, the conditions, there's always challenges to overcome it, and we'll do that.'Spurs can take comfort from the victory at Eintracht Frankfurt in the quarter final and the knowledge they are inching closer to a first major trophy since 2008, and a ticket to rejoin Europe's elite.And Postecoglou was undeterred by former Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, now FIFA's chief of global football development, who claimed the Europa League winners should not go into the Champions League as they have for the last 10 years.'Spurs does crazy things to people,' scoffed Postecoglou.\\xa0'Put that club into any sentence and invariably they all come out and try to diminish us as much as they can. Why wasn't it an issue before but it is now? 'Last year, fifth didn't get you into the Champions League and now it does. What does that mean? There are competition rules and it's not the first year. I've got great respect for Arsene, he's one of the legends of the game but Spurs does crazy things to people, I love it.'Predicted Spurs XI (4-3-3): Vicario; Porro, Romero, Van de Ven, Udogie; Bissouma, Bentancur, Kulusevski; Johnson, Solanke, Richarlison\", 'location': 'NOR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Tottenham faces Bodo/Glimt in Europa League\\nENTITIES: Bodo/Glimt, Tottenham, Ange Postecoglou, James Maddison\\nEVENT: Tottenham leads Bodo/Glimt 3-1 going into the second leg of the Europa League semi-final in Norway.

Your villain and your setting are right there, plus all the awful connotations your imagination can whip up regarding both. Eli Craig’s new slasher has a lot to live up to with a title like that, but the director of Tucker & Dale vs. Evil knows what he’s doing. He’s got all the ingredients: appealing characters, a small town with a huge secret, a ghoulish killer, and an underlying message that makes sure the film is about more than just a killer clown splattering victims around a cornfield—though rest assured, there’s still plenty of that. After a preface set in 1991 that immediately delivers—kids partying in a cornfield are ambushed by a maniac with very large shoes—we cut to the present day and get a closer look at Kettle Springs, Missouri, a farm town that’s fallen on hard times since the Baypen Brand Corn Syrup factory closed. The company’s mascot, a grinning clown named “Frendo,” still looms over the town as a reminder of more prosperous days. More recently, desperately bored local teens have cast him as the masked killer in horror shorts they put out on YouTube.\\nThe sleepy rural community soon adds two new residents: Quinn (Ginny & Georgia‘s Katie Douglas) and her father (Aaron Abrams). He’s accepted the job of town doctor, figuring that after the sudden loss of Quinn’s mother, the pair could use a fresh start. Though she quickly befriends the YouTube clique, Quinn’s not thrilled about relocating to Nowheresville, especially as she picks up on how hostile the older residents are toward the local teenagers. But there’s not much time to marinate on that as things get going; Clown in a Cornfield takes place over just a few days and nights, and a good amount of screen time is given over to red-nosed, red-wigged terror, wielding chainsaws, crossbows, cattle prods, and other conveniently available implements of destruction.\\n© RLJE Films/Shudder Despite that title, and despite Craig being the guy behind the cult-beloved Tucker & Dale vs. Evil, Clown in a Cornfield is actually less of a comedy than you might think. There are witty, self-referential lines—the script is by Craig and Carter Blanchard, adapted from the novel by Adam Cesare—but Frendo is not to be fucked with, as one character cautions Quinn. Whoever’s under the mask is ruthless and furious, and Clown in a Cornfield engages in some sly misdirection about the killer’s ID as more and more bodies pile up. Throughout the film, Clown in a Cornfield pulls on the threads of that generation-gap conflict and even brings technology in as part of it. Quinn’s new friends love making videos and being online, but they’re surrounded by adults who don’t see the point of even the most basic progress. (One of the funniest scenes, teased in the film’s trailer, is a crisis that occurs when the only way to call for help involves a rotary phone.)\\nThe motivation behind Frendo’s slaughter ties into this divide, and if the pieces don’t quite completely fit together at the end, Clown in a Cornfield has by then built up a lot of energetic goodwill. It ultimately proves itself to be a mostly straightforward slasher film—complete with many of the expected tropes, including pleasingly gruesome gore—with some clever and subversive jabs along the way. Clown in a Cornfield also stars Kevin Durand, Will Sasso, Carson MacCormac, Vincent Muller, Cassandra Potenzo, and Verity Marks. It hits theaters May 9. Want more io9 news?

They all underestimated Labor. They all exaggerated One Nation and so on. All of them,” says Murray Goot, an emeritus professor of politics at Macquarie University.“And there are 10 of these polls. Roughly [taken] at the same time.”How the polls played outA simple average of the final polls had Labor’s two-party preferred at 52.3%, and primary vote at 31.6%. On the current count, these are smaller misses than in the 2019 election, when pollsters incorrectly showed Labor ahead.But all of the polls this election were wrong in the same direction.Polls underestimated Labor’s two-party preferred voteSeveral pollsters have told Guardian Australia the record number of votes for third parties and the record level of soft and undecided voters made their jobs more difficult – but say most were not too far off the mark in the end.“Essential, along with most polls, accurately picked up that the trend was moving towards Labor during the course of the campaign,” says Peter Lewis, the executive director of Essential, who runs Guardian Australia’s Essential poll.“Additionally our methodology of including undecideds means that with the final 4.8% that declared ‘unsure’ the week before the poll leaning Labor, the polling captured the momentum, if not the final ‘landslide’.”\\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email\\nThe RedBridge director, Kos Samaras, says there was “a lot of heavy backgrounding” that the public polls were wrong. RedBridge’s final poll had Labor at 53% to 47%, and it was showing Labor was doing well in key seats and in Queensland.“We were recording pretty big numbers for Labor and I thought maybe that was an aberration,” he says.“Clearly it was not.”The ‘herding’ effectThere should be some “noise” in polling, with estimates bouncing around. A month before election day, some on social media were already questioning if the polls were too stable. There were similar concerns by election watchers in 2019.Adrian Beaumont, an election analyst at the Conversation, suspects “herding”, when pollsters consciously or unconsciously adjust their results to match those published by their competitors, so they won’t be singled out if they are wrong.Guardian Australia is not accusing any of the pollsters of herding in this campaign.In the 2019 election, there was such a small spread among the polls that the Nobel prize-winning astrophysicist Brian Schmidt calculated the odds of it being chance at greater than 100,000 to one.Psychic croc's election fail, Albanese heads straight for ice-cream, and ‘the other guy’ – video“The polls were afraid of showing a Labor victory by a landslide margin,” Beaumont says of the polls this year. “That’s why they were out – the polls understated Labor’s vote.“If you go back a couple of weeks, Roy Morgan had Labor winning 55.5% of the two-party vote. But then in the week before the election they came back down to 53%. They stayed at 53 in the final poll, which was published on the Friday before the election. If they hadn’t herded they may well have been the most accurate of pollsters.”In response to questions, Roy Morgan says there were “no changes in sampling and methodology” over the final weeks of the campaign, except to stop survey respondents nominating candidates who were not running in their electorates after the final candidate list was announced.“This is standard practice for pollsters during election campaigns,” Roy Morgan’s poll manager, Julian McCrann, says. “If there was any ‘herding’ it was towards us – we led the pack and picked up the swing to the ALP well before any other pollster.”McCrann also points out that several projections now show the final result will be about 54-46, “which is closer to a 53-47 result [final published Roy Morgan Poll] than a 55.5-44.5 result”.Method mixesGoot dismisses the idea there could have been a “late swing” towards the Labor party in the days after polls were collecting data. There were five polls conducted within a day or two before the election, he says, and they were no more accurate than earlier polls.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionFinal polls underestimated Labor“I can’t speak for other pollsters, but as far as Essential is concerned there is no herding by us,” Lewis says.“We ran double samples through the campaign but stuck to the methodology which we disclose through the Australian Polling Council.”There’s a lot of art to polling, including making assumptions about how preferences will flow, and the choice of how to “weight” survey samples so that they match the population at large.Throughout the campaign, some election analysts showed these methodological assumptions can have huge impacts, by recalculating published polls using preference flows from the last election rather than respondents’ stated preferences.“There was a fair discrepancy [among polls] depending on what you did,” Goot says.“In one case it was a difference of at least two percentage points between going with one [method] or another.”But there is no consensus on which method is more accurate.Sample sourcingGoot thinks herding was possible in this election – but “without transparency it’s difficult to know”. Either way, he says, the industry has more fundamental problems – such as whether survey samples cover everyone who should be included, and how pollsters handled “nonresponse” groups unable or unwilling to participate.Modern polling samples aren’t randomly drawn from the population. Rather, companies get access to “panels” of people from online databases. These databases are put together from a variety of sources, including loyalty programs, but we know very little about them.“What we suspect is they contain a very small percentage of all possible people that could be in it, and that should be in it,” Goot says.“[Pollsters] all say that they’ve got the best selection to draw on, but one possibility is that most of them go to the same source, and that doesn’t have all that many people in it. Some of the people answering the polls may be in more than one [poll].”Lewis says sourcing samples is a “challenge”, but that Essential’s outreach team “work hard to minimise the need for weighting”.McCrann says Roy Morgan interviews about 1,500 Australians each week. “And that is via multi-mode interviewing including online, telephone and face-to-face interviewing and we aren’t using the same databases of any rival pollster,” he says.How does weighting work?While polling companies request a spread of genders, ages and locations for their panels, not all respond, requiring them to proportionately scale up or down those that do – weighting.But weighting relies on the assumption that those who do and don’t respond to surveys are roughly similar. If this isn’t true, or the number of responses is very small, it can introduce other issues.“If, for example, the young people who respond are going to vote Green in reasonably large numbers, and the young people that don’t respond are going to vote Green in much smaller numbers, then if you weight you’re going to exaggerate the Green vote,” Goot says.Even after the 2019 election polling failure, there’s little transparency – but Goot believes there was a “good step” towards it with the polling council, formally established in 2020.Still, he notes, “not all the pollsters are members. And members don’t have to disclose very much.“They have to tell us what factors they weight by, but not how they do this. They have to put up their questions. They don’t tell us anything much about sampling, response rates or any of the other things that can go wrong with the sample.”\", 'location': 'AUS', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Australian election polls uniformly underestimated Labor support\\nENTITIES: Labor, Coalition, One Nation, Murray Goot, Peter Lewis, Kos Samaras, Adrian Beaumont, Brian Schmidt, Roy Morgan, Julian McCrann\\nEVENT: Australian election polls underestimated Labor's support, with uniform errors across different polling organizations.\\nCONTEXT: Pollsters uniformly underestimated Labor in Australian election, raising questions.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 53432, 'sourceId': 12762, 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/08/australia-fuel-petrol-cost-global-oil-prices-down', 'title': 'Global oil prices have plunged.

Photograph: Joel Carrett/AAPOil prices crashed again this week, sending the cost of petroleum plunging to four-year lows.Yet Australian motorists have seen little relief at the petrol pump despite months of depressed crude prices, raising questions over whether lower wholesale costs will be passed on.Here’s what you need to know.What happened to crude oil prices?Oil prices are at the lowest they have been since early 2021.Globally, brent crude oil prices spiked after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine well above US$100 a barrel, before trending lower. They then crashed through the US$60 barrier on Monday.Oil prices over timeThe recent falls came after the oil-producing cartel Opec+ decided at the weekend to increase production in May and June by more than expected, according to Commonwealth Bank analyst Vivek Dhar.“[That] has been tied to punishing OPEC+ members like Iraq and Kazakhstan that have consistently produced more than their allocated quota,” Dhar wrote in an investment note.As supply expands, demand has also threatened to recede amid a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies sparked by Donald Trump’s new tariff regime.The US economy shrank for the first time in three years during the first quarter of 2025 and China’s factory activity slowed in April, as analysts predict lower growth around the world.Will petrol prices fall?Analysts expect petrol prices will fall. Australia’s wholesale prices, paid by petrol retailers, are already down to as low as 156c per litre for regular unleaded, according to NRMA spokesperson Peter Khoury.That means bowser prices should come down to temporary lows of near 160c in the major cities, excluding Hobart, Canberra and Darwin.“We expect to see average prices in the 160s – possibly even lower, depending on if the trend continues – and that’s obviously great news,” Khoury says. “Heading down, but we don’t know how far and how long.”By comparison, average retail prices in major cities were about 180c per litre at the end of 2024, according to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.Wholesale prices in 2024 were around 170c a litre and had peaked at 200c in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, according to NRMA.When will petrol prices fall?The fall will vary across the country, in part because prices rise and fall in a predictable pattern independently of the wholesale price.In Perth, that pattern or price cycle sees peaks and troughs recur each week. Recent falls in wholesale prices have already pushed Perth prices to lows of 156c per litre and brought its peak price down from about 195c to 190c.Perth price petrolIn Adelaide, the cycle takes two or more weeks from peak to peak, which means retail costs should fall towards 160c a litre in May.Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane have price cycles lasting a month or longer, the ACCC estimates. Sydney recently hit its cyclical peak and should see lower prices soon, Khoury says.“We’ll expect it to continue to fall into the low 160s and possibly even into the high 150s depending on what happens over the next two or three weeks, because prices fall about a cent a day.”Sydney petrol priceMelbourne and Brisbane, though, appear to have already reached their low point for this cycle, so motorists will only see lower bowser prices if the wholesale cost stays low.Melbourne petrol pricePetrol costs tend to be more steady in Australia’s other cities and regions without price cycles, meaning prices may not fall below 170c per litre unless the global oil price continues to fall.Analysts are predicting oil prices will stay depressed, with CBA’s Dhar on Monday pointing to an average of US$65 per barrel for the rest of the year and by Wednesday suggesting prices had already hit their lowest point.But global volatility means motorists can’t assume they’ll be spending less at the bowser, Khoury says.“Things can change very quickly,” Khoury says.', 'location': 'AUS', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Australian petrol prices uncertain despite oil plunge\\nENTITIES: NRMA, Peter Khoury, Opec+, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Donald Trump, ACCC\\nEVENT: Global oil prices have fallen to four-year lows, but Australian petrol prices may not decrease significantly due to wholesale price cycles and potential market volatility.

He makes a passionate case against the ruin caused by industrial overfishing and the sinister mega-trawlers which roam everywhere, raking the seabed with their vast metal nets, brutally and wastefully hoovering up fish populations of which the majority is often simply thrown away, depleting developing countries and fishing communities of their share. Attenborough says that this is the new colonialism. The film is released in cinemas in anticipation of the UN’s World Oceans Day in June, which is campaigning for 30% of the world’s oceans to be preserved from exploitation – at present, only around 3% is protected in this way.As he arrives at his 99th birthday, Sir David presents this new documentary in the context of his own remarkable life and career, studying and thinking about the oceans as the last part of the world to be fully understood and also, perhaps, the last part to be exploited – and despoiled. As he says, until relatively recently, the ocean was regarded as a kind of mysterious, undifferentiated Sahara, a wilderness, of interest largely for providing an apparently endless supply of food. But he shows us an amazing vista of diversity and life, an extraordinary undulating landscape, a giant second planet of whose existence humanity has long been unaware but now seems in danger of damaging or even destroying.Attenborough shows us that glorious places of colour and light and life can be scoured and scorched into a nuclear winter of nothingness by overfishing, but that by preserving places from this kind of industrialisation, creating “no take zones”, we can give the ocean and its lifeforms time to recover. This is often possible within quite a short space of time and the revived species can “spill over” into other zones; effectively, it is this preservation model that is being suggested.But Attenborough is always emphasising that this is not a cause for complacency, for saying that overfishing doesn’t matter because the overfished areas can always be nursed back to life: because we never know how close we have come to the point of no return. Attenborough matches the natural world’s grandeur with his own intellectual and moral seriousness.', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE:

their unyielding support.”An Israeli official confirmed to the Telegraph that the offensive would “expand beyond air strikes” and “continue as long as necessary”.The surprise attack killed several top Hamas officials, including Issam al-Da’alis, the long-serving prime minister.Israeli media reported that the strikes were planned to take advantage of changed nighttime movement patterns during Ramadan.Medical facilities overwhelmedThey left more than 400 people dead and nearly 600 injured, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.The Red Cross said Gaza’s medical facilities were “overwhelmed”.The White House gave the operation its full backing and blamed Hamas for not releasing hostages.But hostage families expressed their horror at the resumed fighting, accusing the Israeli Government of “abandoning” their loved ones in favour of waging war.On Tuesday, the Israeli military threatened to intensify strikes, including widening the operation beyond an aerial campaign, unless Hamas returned to “genuine” negotiations.It came as the IDF ordered civilians in Gaza to evacuate certain zones on the outskirts of Gaza City and Khan Younis, suggesting a ground campaign could be imminent.Hostages still heldTanks and other military vehicles were photographed at the border fence.Announcing the military operation, the Prime Minister’s office said the action had been taken “following Hamas’ repeated refusal to release our hostages, as well as its rejection of all the proposals it has received from US presidential envoy Steve Witkoff from the mediators”.Gideon Sa’ar, the Foreign Minister, said the strikes were necessary to break the impasse.“In the past two and a half weeks, we have reached a deadlock – there is neither air strikes nor the return of hostages, and this is something Israel cannot accept,” he said.An unnamed military source later said the aim of the operation was to push Hamas into accepting the Witkoff proposal, including an extended ceasefire and a greater influx of aid in return for the release of living hostages.Thirty-three living hostages were released under the 42-day first phase of the deal, which ran from January 15.In outline, phase two obliged Israel to withdraw all its troops from Gaza as a prelude to ending the war.Netanyahu aims to defeat HamasBut Netanyahu repeatedly stalled negotiations on these points because he said it failed to meet his war aim of defeating Hamas once and for all.Witkoff tried to negotiate an alternative deal that roughly resembled a repeat of phase one, but Hamas refused because it did not address the group’s future in the strip.The terror group issued a statement on Tuesday saying: “Netanyahu and his extremist government have decided to overturn the ceasefire agreement, exposing the prisoners in Gaza to an unknown fate.”Emily Damari, a British-Israeli hostage who was released in January, said she was “crushed and disappointed” by the resumption of fighting.The Hostage and Missing Families Forum said: “The greatest fear of the families, of the hostages and of Israeli citizens has been realised.“We are horrified, furious and scared by the intentional shattering of the process of returning our loved ones from the terrible Hamas captivity.“The return to fighting before the return of the last hostage will cost us the 59 hostages who are still in Gaza and who can still be saved and returned.”Netanyahu responded by saying: “All of our hearts are with the hostages and their families.“They are going through an inhuman nightmare every day and every minute.”Twenty-four of the remaining hostages are believed to be living.Hundreds deadAs of mid-afternoon on Tuesday, 404 dead and 562 injured had been taken to hospitals, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, with efforts under way to rescue people trapped in the rubble.Pictures emerged of an apparent blaze at a tented encampment near Khan Younis as a result of the strikes, while others showed what appeared to be distraught civilians identifying loved ones.Dr Mohammad Qishta, an MSF emergency doctor at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, told the Telegraph‘s Battlelines podcast that the scene at the hospital was “disastrous”.“We have received many bodies and parts of bodies,” he said. “Most of them children and women.”Claire Nicolet, the head of emergencies for MSF, said from Gaza: “The population here is completely afraid.“Of course, they saw that this is a full restart of the fighting and they are very scared of what’s next. Unfortunately, we also understood that the medical evacuation has stopped for now which means that normally every day there are a few patients that are going outside by Rafah.“This will not happen today and we don’t know how it will continue.”Leaders killedThe other prominent Hamas leaders killed in Gaza overnight were named as Bahjat Abu Sultan, Ahmad Omar al-Taha, Mahmoud Abu Wafteh and Abu Obaida al-Jimasi.Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority were among Arab governments opposing the action.Qatar’s foreign ministry said Israel’s “escalating policies will ultimately ignite the region and undermine its security and stability”. The Gulf state and Egypt said they were urgently trying to establish talks to halt the escalation.Netanyahu is facing a huge controversy over his attempt to sack Ronen Bar, the head of Israel’s internal security service, just as the organisation is conducting an inquiry into alleged Qatari spies in Netanyahu’s private office and what role that might have played in policymaking before October 7.A large protest was planned in Jerusalem on Wednesday against the dismissal.Politics deniedThe Prime Minister criticised the press for “lies” and denied that any political considerations were behind the military operation in Gaza. He also praised the US for acting against Iran.The resumption of the war has pleased Netanyahu’s far-Right coalition partners, upon whom he relies to stay in Government.Bezalel Smotrich, the Finance Minister, welcomed the strikes, promising that the renewed fighting will “look completely different from what has been done so far”.Conversely, Itamar Ben-Gvir, who withdrew his Otzma Yehudit party from the coalition to protest against the hostage deal, announced his intention to rejoin the Government on Tuesday.Yair Golan, a former IDF Major General and now leader of the Left-leaning The Democrats, said: “The soldiers on the front lines and the hostages in Gaza are just cards in Netanyahu’s game of survival.“The protests must erupt in fury,” he said.At a rally in Tel Aviv’s Hostages Square on Tuesday, Keith Siegel, a former Hamas captive, told the crowd: “When the previous ceasefire collapsed, one of the terrorists pointed a gun at me and started beating me. He was very angry and took all his anger out on me.”', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Israel resumes Gaza strikes, hostage talks stall\\nENTITIES: Netanyahu, Hamas, Gaza, Israel, Steve Witkoff, US\\nEVENT: Israel resumed military operations in Gaza after Hamas rejected hostage deal proposals, leading to numerous casualties and stalled negotiations.\\nCONTEXT: Netanyahu restarts Gaza strikes, hostage negotiations stall.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 53587, 'sourceId': 12772, 'url': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14681939/Peter-FitzSimons-Lisa-Wilkinson-election-party-jessica-millward-joel-dry-inside-mail.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490', 'title': \"New Idea's VERY expensive mistake.

INSIDE MAIL\\n15:11, 07 May 2025, updated\\n01:23, 08 May 2025\\nBy\\nSTEVE JACKSON FOR DAILY MAIL AUSTRALIA\\nand\\nPETER VAN ONSELEN, POLITICAL EDITOR FOR DAILY MAIL AUSTRALIA\\nLeftie Christmas on the lower north shore\\nForget winning a seat in parliament - the biggest prize on election day was winning a seat in Peter FitzSimons and Lisa Wilkinson\\'s lounge room as the live vote count got underway.The media power couple opened their sprawling six-bedroom mansion to a star-studded selection of international identities - from acclaimed writers and television stars, to Hollywood actors and celebrity chefs - as they followed all the thrills and spills of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese\\'s landslide victory.Inside Mail can reveal\\xa0the heavy hitters\\xa0who converged on Sydney\\'s lower north shore for the soirée included Golden Globe-winning actress\\xa0Rachel Griffiths; political commentator\\xa0David Marr; breakfast radio host Amanda Keller, celebrity silk Sue Chrysanthou;\\xa0Blanche D\\'Alpuget, the biographer-turned-mistress-turned-wife of the late ex-PM\\xa0Bob Hawke; Man Booker prize nominee Steve Toltz; novelist Geraldine Brookes; Kelly Sloan, the chair of Destination NSW; Georgie Dent, the CEO of parents\\' advocacy group The Parenthood; and one-time The Chaser-comedian-turned-ABC-radio-host Craig Reucassel.That was a mouthful. And that\\'s not the half of the guest list - we just couldn\\'t fit any more names in that sentence.Indeed, there were so many A-listers at FitzSimons and Wilkinson\\'s ballot-box bash they couldn\\'t fit them all in one room; and they had to spread their venerable guests across several rooms as the election broadcast played out across two massive TVs.It\\'s no shock to learn invitees were glued to the ABC\\'s coverage in one of the lounges, including The Mentalist star Simon Baker who is \\'super into his politics\\' and was particularly engrossed in ousted Opposition leader Peter Dutton\\'s failed bid to retain his Brisbane seat of Dickson from former journo\\xa0Ali France.However, insiders tells us they were surprised to see Channel Nine\\'s election coverage on the big screen in the other room, given Wilkinson\\'s acrimonious exit from the network in 2017 amid a pay disparity dispute with her Today show co-host Karl Stefanovic (who was in Brisbane covering Dutton\\'s sombre election night party). Forget winning a seat in parliament - the biggest prize on election day was winning a seat in Peter FitzSimons and Lisa Wilkinson\\'s lounge room as the live vote count got underway. (FitzSimons and\\xa0Lisa Wilkinson are pictured on NYE 2021 with daughter Billi and son Louis) (Fear not … we hear that TV was switched over to the public broadcaster as the night wore on, too).Sources tell us the glitzy evening was vaguely reminiscent of the couple\\'s famous annual Australia Day parties - a tradition they nixed in 2023 out of political correctness - and which, as everyone knows, involved all guests being invited to \\'bring a plate\\' of food.And this bash was no different. We hear the communal buffet laid out on the duo\\'s elegant dining table at the weekend included everything from plates of humble party pies to an oversized pavlova, with an eye-watering leg of lamb the smorgasbord\\'s star attraction.FitzSimons\\' longtime friend, former radio co-host Mike Carlton and his ABC Foreign Correspondent exec producer wife Morag Ramsay also brought \\'a delicious sponge cake of their own creation\\'.\\xa0Osher Günsberg, who has plenty of time on his hands after all his Channel 10 shows were chopped last year, rocked up with a \\'fantastic hot curry\\'. And one-time Sunday Night reporter-turned-ABC producer Rahni Sadler kept things cool and casual with a prawn salad.Naturally, all eyes were on what renowned British celebrity chef\\xa0Nigella Lawson, who is in Sydney to host three specially curated dinners for the Vivid festival next month, would whip up for the occasion.And while she was a bit hamstrung by the fact she doesn\\'t have a kitchen to cook in while in the Harbour City, she certainly didn\\'t disappoint after arriving with a bulk delivery of expensive French bubbly. Viva la Nigella!It certainly didn\\'t go to waste. While FitzSimons famously gave up booze - and somehow sugar as well - years ago, we hear others were more than happy to indulge throughout the night.In a surprising twist halfway through the evening, there was absolutely no jeering as Dutton gave his concession speech live on TV about 9.30pm, with even the Liberal party leader\\'s harshest critics acknowledging it was a masterclass in grace. It\\'s customary for guests to bring a dish, but without a kitchen in Sydney to work with, celebrity chef Nigella Lawson (right, with Wilkinson at a previous gathering) brought champagne instead Famous guests at the election night party included Golden Globe-winning actress Rachel Griffiths The Mentalist star Simon Baker,\\xa0who is \\'super into his politics\\', was also in attendance Blanche D\\'Alpuget (right), the biographer-turned-mistress-turned-wife of the late ex-PM Bob Hawke (left), brought political gravitas to the proceedings. (They are pictured here in 2013) \\'There was no booing, everyone stopped and listened to his speech, and thought that he was really respectful and applauded his comments,\\' one guest tells us.\\'Then we all sort of looked at each other and our attention turned to Albo - and how much he was going to win by.\\'It was a very warm night with like-minded (mostly) lefties.\\'Aboriginal activist Thomas Mayo, one of the architects of the failed Voice to Parliament, was also present - and took time out from the festivities to claim Labor\\'s thumping win was a victory for Indigenous recognition on social media.\\'Tonight, Australia voted No to ignorance & Yes to Acknowledgement; No to xenophobia & Yes to Welcomes; No to regression & Yes to progress,\\' he wrote on X from FitzSimons and Wilkinson\\'s home.Seven\\'s axed Friday night funnyman Mark Humphries was also there… having hosted Fitzy on his new ABC weekend radio show Weekend Evenings just last month.Of course, as the night wore on, we hear there were plenty of media war stories being traded at increasingly loud volumes and with increasingly amusing details.Word is the two Peters - former Sydney Morning Herald editor-in-chief Peter Fray and television news god Peter Meakin - were rivalling the Two Ronnies\\xa0by proving themselves to be among the most popular raconteurs, which is hardly surprising.With so many yarns floating about, it\\'s little wonder the party was still pumping into the wee hours of the morning.Killing season at LaborEven though it\\'s all celebrations publicly over at Labor HQ, a brouhaha is breaking out within the new-look parliamentary party as the factional left and right go to war divvying up the spoils of victory.The left faction surged, picking up more seats than the right, allowing it to impose its power over the traditionally dominant right wing. The left faction is now coming after senior figures in the right as cabinet positions are being determined.The PM doesn\\'t get to pick his frontbenchers - the factions do. But the fact Anthony Albanese is also the biggest left-wing factional gorilla in the room means the power of the left is even greater. Even though it\\'s all celebrations publicly over at Labor HQ, a brouhaha is breaking out within the new-look parliamentary party as the factional left and right go to war divvying up the spoils of victory. (Anthony Albanese, centre right, is pictured celebrating Saturday\\'s election victory with his fiancée\\xa0Jodie Haydon, right, son Nathan, centre left, and Senator Penny Wong, left) Senior right-wing ministers such as Ed Husic, Jason Clare and Chris Bowen are at risk of demotion if the left gets its way.It\\'s already been decided that outgoing senior right-wing figure Bill Shorten\\'s cabinet position will be filled by someone from the left and there may be more.Former head of the trade union movement Ged Kearney will rise into the ministry alongside other left-wing operatives such as the PM\\'s assistant minister Patrick Gorman.Former right wing Labor PMs, such as Paul Keating, are aghast at the expected shift to the left Labor is now likely to make as it takes control of the Senate in conjunction with a Greens balance of power.\\'It\\'s over, the Labor Party won\\'t be what it used to be\\', one senior factional figure in the Labor right tells Inside Mail.\\'The economic reforming legacy of Bob [Hawke] and Paul [Keating] will become a more distant memory than it already is.\\'\\'Name one serious economic reform we did in Albo\\'s first term?\\' adds the disgruntled Labor figure. The left\\'s own Tanya Plibersek (right) is set to cop another demotion after Albo (left) dumped her from her beloved education portfolio to environment after the 2022 election win Even within the right, divisions are starting to surface as ministers manoeuvre to survive. Deputy PM Richard Marles is reportedly pushing to take cabinet positions off the NSW factional right to shore up his Victorian power base as the left starts to run over the top of the once-dominant right.\\'We\\'re eating our own rather than banding together to hold off the left that always got more than it should have when it was just a pimple on the party and we ran the show,\\' another right-wing MP tells me.\\'They don\\'t care; it\\'s classic hard left bullying\\', the MP adds.While it will be all smiles when Albo finally announces his new-look ministry, behind the scenes those likely to miss out or get demoted are seething, vowing to fight back \\'however we have to\\'.It\\'s not just the right at risk of being shut out by the PM and his senate sidekick Penny Wong. The left\\'s own Tanya Plibersek is set to cop another demotion after Albo dumped her from her beloved education portfolio to environment after the 2022 election win.Plibersek, the PM\\'s \\'frenemy number one\\', is at risk of losing her cabinet spot, although Labor sources tell me she\\'ll hang on for pure optics, \\'and just get pushed into the worst and most irrelevant portfolio Anthony can find\\'.They do say that what happens behind the scenes in politics is like watching sausages get made. And the chaos within the ranks of Labor is nothing compared to the shenanigans going on as the hapless Liberals try to work out who gets the poisoned chalice of being the next leader of what\\'s left of the parliamentary party.Still, the anger and resentment inside Labor will reverberate for months, if not years.Meanwhile, expect shockwaves as policy changes are announced by an emboldened ALP dominated by MPs and senators who, back in their uni days, believed Australia had to become a socialist panacea modelled on the sort of excesses\\xa0Gough Whitlam never got the chance to enact because he only survived as PM for three years.With friends like these...\\xa0Anthony Albanese\\xa0took the opportunity at his first media conference after his thumping election win to thank the many world leaders who had reached out to him since his victory.One of those was the Singaporean PM, whom he also congratulated for his election win on the very same night.As resounding as Labor\\'s win was, it was nothing compared to the one\\xa0Singapore\\'s People\\'s Action Party had, securing 83 out of the 93 seats on offer.While that\\'s nothing compared to the way WA Labor likes to win in the one-party state the west has become in recent times, it\\'s actually a closer result than you usually see in Singapore.That\\'s because it\\'s not actually a true democracy. The opposition has limits placed on its ability to campaign, and the ruling party has never lost! In his first press conference since being re-elected, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese (pictured) congratulated the Singaporean PM\\xa0for his election win on the very same night Perhaps Albo doesn\\'t realise Singapore isn\\'t a democracy like we are. Or maybe he has plans to use his newfound power to emulate the success of the PAP in Singapore.Either way, it\\'s a little unusual for a democratic western leader to congratulate a non-democratic leader on an election win, just because they pretend to be a true democracy and hold stacked elections.Putin\\xa0doesn\\'t head to the polls again until five years from now. He won last year\\'s fraudulent Russian election with 88.5 per cent of the vote. After the size of Albo\\'s win he may well still be around then to congratulate the Kremlin on another historic victory.Easy ride at first presser\\xa0Speaking of Albo\\'s first presser since his victory, can you guess what the first word uttered by the assembled media was when the PM waved through his first question?\\'Congratulations.\\'Not exactly a swift return to holding the newly elected government to account!We won\\'t go too hard on the gesture, since it was delivered by the Australian Financial Review\\'s Phil Coorey, one of the best in the business in Canberra.Let\\'s just hope the role of the Fourth Estate is a little more robust going forward, because with the opposition crippled by the election outcome, it\\'s capacity to hold Labor to account in its second term could be severely limited.Jessica blasts \\'codswallop\\' rumour about her husbandNow, as everyone knows, Inside Mail has a nasty habit of spoiling the party... which is surprising because we don\\'t tend to get invited to all that many.Indeed, just last week we spoiled former 7News reporter Joel Dry\\'s homecoming party after revealing Nine was about to announce the network had signed him to co-host its 6pm Brisbane bulletin alongside Melissa Downes.\\xa0We also revealed not everyone (or, in fact, hardly anyone) was pleased with the \\'captain\\'s call\\' made by\\xa0Nine News Queensland boss\\xa0Brendan Hockings\\xa0to parachute\\xa0Dry in to replace veteran\\xa0newsman Andrew Lofthouse, who retired due to ill health in January.Many thought it was rough that network stalwart\\xa0Josh Bavas had been overlooked for the gig - and that\\'s putting it politely.Now, if the newsroom insiders we spoke to were unimpressed by the appointment... they were even less impressed by the time Brisbane\\'s sleepy hometown newssheet the Courier-Mail belatedly got onto the story later in the day.\\'Brendan Hockings has lost the plot,\\' one source told the Courier-Mail after the paper finally stumbled across the development.

If possible, just try.\\'No Idea about contempt of court?\\xa0In case you\\'ve been living under a rock, there\\'s a big news story going on at the moment involving a controversial dish.

Yesterday afternoon, we finally got an answer: Yes.Before his loss to Labor candidate Sarah Witty was called by several media outlets on Wednesday, one senior Liberal MP, no doubt shattered by the loss on Saturday night, did ring to tell us: \\'As bad as what happened to us is, I can live with it a little better if that pair [Bandt and Ryan] also loses.\\'It\\'s not quite a case of the enemy of my enemy is my friend - a saying believed to have originated in ancient Indian political philosophy, specifically from the Sanskrit text Arthashastra - but it\\'s close enough.

This time around they\\'ve only lost one, and might actually offset it by winning another one off Labor, despite a bloodbath for the Liberals who look set to lose at least 13 more and are behind in another of others still too close to call.That\\'s only going to give the Nats greater say in the combined party room and around the shadow cabinet table, which might promote policies more favourable to people living in the bush than in the cities.This could be a major problem for the Coalition\\'s chances of returning to power anytime soon, because while the Nats have done well hanging onto their seats, there really aren\\'t many more they can target to grow much further.The opposition need to win seats in the cities, and that\\'s the job of Liberals, who are a dying breed in the parliament.Aunty\\'s advice: \\'Just dress better\\'\\xa0 Sweeney walked the Met Gala red carpet in a shimmering black Miu Miu gown Now we all know the ABC likes to cry poor - and who can really blame them?

Headline and underlying inflation are back in the RBA\\'s target band for the first time since 2014, paving the way for a further 25bp interest rate cut in May. And the labour market continues to outperform expectations, with the unemployment rate tracking at just over 4% — still around historically low levels.\"However, he warns it won\\'t all be smooth sailing.\"This term of Government will still present its share of economic challenges. Three stand out above the rest:* Navigating the global trade war and US China strategic competition;* Tackling housing affordability and boosting housing supply; and* Managing the next phase of the net zero transition, particularly the pressures in gas and electricity markets.\"He believes some of these forces may push Labor to reconsider some policies that it did not take to the 2025 election, or even ruled out.\"The Government has been clear that they don\\'t intend to make changes to negative gearing or the capital gains tax discount,\" Yeaman notes.\"If the housing debate intensifies, or there is a need to raise more revenue for budget repair, expect the pressure to grow on the Government to reopen this discussion, especially given their larger majority.\"And he does believe the need to raise more revenue will be on the agenda over the next few years, especially with the Albanese government committed to another two rounds of modest tax cuts in July 2026 and July 2027.\"To date, the 2024 25 budget position is tracking ahead of expectations according to the monthly financial statements. As at March, the financial year to date budget deficit was $21.2bn, compared to the expected profile at the time of MYEFO of $34.1bn,\" Yeaman observes.\"Both expenses and revenue are tracking better than forecast due to a stronger taxation revenue take than expected. Most of this has come through company tax and super tax revenue. On the spending side defence spending is running well below estimates, as is social security but outlays can be lumpy.\"In the medium term, structural pressures on the Budget will continue to build. The era of large revenue upgrades from commodity prices appears behind us and spending pressures remain evident in several areas.\"In other words, at some point someone is going to have to undertake some serious, and probably painful, reforms to either taxation or government spending.The ABC\\'s Peter Martin, the Grattan Institute\\'s CEO Aruna Sathanapally and myself discuss some of these reform options in The Economy, Stupid on Radio National at 5:30pm today, or via the ABC Listen or your favourite podcast app anytime.\\xa08h agoThu 8 May 2025 at 5:39amUpdateBy Nadia DalyIt seems like you have been relegate on this site, I use to get to you as part of \"for you \" now I have to find you amongst all the other news, not a good change - Ilia Thanks for the love, Ilia, and sorry you\\'ve been having trouble finding us.

We think unemployment is currently close to its non‑accelerating inflation rate.\"\"Even as the softening labour market reduces wage pressures, real wages are expected to continue to grow given inflation has returned to the RBA’s 2 3% inflation target band.\"While the note\\'s author, Commbank\\'s Stephen Wu noted the RBA was \"cautious and uncertain about the outlook for wages growth\", he said CBA feels more confident about the outlook for wages growth.\"A modest uptick in quarterly wages growth is likely in Q1 25, based on our internal CBA data and our read of recent negotiated wage outcomes. There are delayed wage agreements with sizable wage increases for a small portion of workers. The impact on WPI should be modest, given weights are based on employers’ wages bill. We expect quarterly WPI rose by 0.8%/qtr in Q1 25, up from 0.7%/qtr in Q4 24.\"10h agoThu 8 May 2025 at 3:39amAdministrators warn childcare centres may have to shutBy Nadia DalyThe future of staff and children at Genius childcare centres remains in doubt as the financially stricken company searches for new buyers.More from Ben Butler and Jade Toomey:Key Event11h agoThu 8 May 2025 at 3:05amDonald Trump spruiks \\'major trade deal\\'By Nadia DalyMore information is coming in on that big tariff announcement expected tomorrow.Donald Trump has posted on his favourite platform Truth Social that a \"MAJOR TRADE DEAL WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF A BIG, AND HIGHLY RESPECTED, COUNTRY.

It says it depends on what further investigations uncover.Here\\'s what Fitch has said in a statement:The additional conditions placed on Macquarie Bank Limited’s (MBL A+/Stable/a) financial services licence by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) will not have an immediate impact on the bank’s ratings, says Fitch Ratings.ASIC requires MBL to address deficiencies in its over-the-counter derivatives trade reporting and futures dealing business.Furthermore, the bank must appoint an independent expert to review and report on the effectiveness of its remediation plan.ASIC’s actions follow a $5 million fine levied against MBL in September 2024 after an ASIC investigation found the bank had failed to prevent suspicious orders being placed on the electricity futures market.No new fines have been announced as part of the current measures.Fitch expects MBL to incur additional expenses from the remediation programme, which will demand increased management attention, but the terms will remain manageable for the bank.The bank\\'s financial profile key rating driver scores, which significantly contribute to its Viability Rating (VR) of \\'a\\', are unlikely to be affected.The risk profile score of ‘a’ is also not affected for now, although there could be downward pressure if further investigations uncover widespread weaknesses in MBL’s risk controls; however, this is not our base-case scenario.MBL has comfortable headroom at the current VR, meaning a downgrade in the VR is unlikely unless several key rating driver scores are lowered at the same time.12h agoThu 8 May 2025 at 1:38am\\'RBA will almost definitely cut\\' rates: analystBy Nadia DalyHello, Nadia Daly here, taking the reins on the blog for this afternoon.We heard the US central bank held on rates overnight, but what about their Aussie counterparts?Here\\'s a note from GSFM investment specialist Stephen Miller, who, like most RBA-watchers, reckons our central bank will cut interest rates by 25 basis points later this month.\"The March quarter consumer price index (CPI) was a good enough result for a 25 bp policy rate cut at the next RBA meeting on May 19-20, but that is about it. The trimmed-mean result at 2.7 per cent was bang on the RBA projection and recall RBA Governor, Michele Bullock, was at pains to quash any notion that the April rate cut was necessarily the start of a sequence of rate cuts at each successive RBA meeting. It may be but the governor wants to give herself and the board maximum optionality for future RBA board meetings.In that sense, expectations in some quarters for a 50bp policy rate cut seem \\'a bridge too far\\'. That said, the upending of the global trade system occasioned by the Trump Administration’s tariff agenda will more likely than not see a global recession by year-end. That prospect, combined with perhaps some \\'over-achievement\\' on inflation relative to the current RBA projection, may mean that we do get successive policy rate reductions at future RBA Board meetings despite the understandable unwillingness of the Governor to pre-commit to such a path.Australia’s eschewal of retaliatory tariff measures may give the RBA a less complicated path to attacking the consequences of a global trade war. The absence of retaliatory measures will mean a mitigation of the inflation part of the global \\'stagflation-lite\\' scenario, allowing the RBA to cut rates and, if need be, to cut aggressively to forestall the inevitable decline in economic growth. So, the RBA will almost definitely cut the policy rate in May. Further, given the prospect of the RBA \\'over-achieving\\' on inflation, combined with the likelihood of global recession, it could well be that the policy rate has a “2” handle by year-end. Just don’t expect the governor to indicate that in her May press conference.\"13h agoThu 8 May 2025 at 1:13amNo farm, no Liberal member?

But politics is a numbers game.Most Australians live in large capital cities. so unless the opposition can win convince more voters in them to get behind their policies and choices, they\\'re not going to win government.Key Event13h agoThu 8 May 2025 at 1:05amFour Corners and ABC Business Reporting Team investigate BunningsBy Rhiana WhitsonFour Corners’ Angus Grigg and ABC business reporter Emilia Terzon dig into Bunnings’ unchecked dominance, its soaring profits, and whether regulators have turned a blind eye while it reshapes Australian retail.\\'Hammered\\' goes to air on Monday 12 May at 8.30pm on ABC TV and\\xa0ABC iview.', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: ASX rises on US trade deal optimism\\nENTITIES: Donald Trump, UK, ASX, US Federal Reserve\\nEVENT: Australian share market closed higher after Trump foreshadowed a major trade deal announcement, reportedly with the UK, and the US Federal Reserve held interest rates.\\nCONTEXT: Optimism about US trade deals boosted Australian market.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 53681, 'sourceId': 12793, 'url': 'https://dynamicbusiness.com/leadership-2/expert/your-taxes-under-albanese-what-the-changes-mean-for-you.html', 'title': 'Your taxes under Albanese: What the changes mean for you', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T13:03:00.000Z', 'content': 'Anthony Albanese emerged the winner of the Federal Election on Saturday 3rd\\xa0May 2025. His Labor Party won the election by a landslide, taking at least 85 seats in the House of Representatives and forming majority government.\\nThe Labor party had taken a number of tax related measures into the election which will now progress, in due course, to become law. Key measures which will impact your taxes include:\\nStandard $1,000 tax deduction\\nFrom 1 July 2026, the government will introduce an automatic deduction of $1,000 for work-related expenses without the need for receipts, benefiting approximately six million workers who currently claim less than this amount.\\nThe reform will allow taxpayers to choose to claim a $1,000 instant tax deduction instead of claiming individual work-related expenses. It is intended to save time and money for taxpayers, who won’t – in theory – need to keep receipts/invoices to substantiate the $1,000 deduction. Of course, in practice, many taxpayers will still need to keep full substantiation as they won’t necessarily know whether their work-related expenses are more or less than $1,000 until they get to the end of the tax year.\\nIf you wish to claim more than $1,000 in work-related expenses, you won’t be able to claim the automatic deduction. You will need to follow the current rules, which involve full substantiation of most expenses.\\nThe ATO will not need to audit taxpayers who claim the standard deduction. This will enable them to focus on higher tax claims (including work-related deductions over $1,000), which is sure to increase the pressure on taxpayers to make sure they have the necessary records to support their claim.\\nCurrently taxpayers can claim up to $300 in work-related expenses without substantiation. If they exceed the $300, they need full substantiation for all their expenses, not just the excess over $300. The $300 limit doesn’t apply to claims for car expenses, meal allowance, award transport payments allowance, or travel allowance expenses. Taxpayers do need to prove how they spent the money and how they calculated the claims.\\nIt remains to be seen how Labor implements this proposal; will it be a blanket exception for all work-related expenses of less than $1,000 or will it simply piggy-back on the existing $300 exception (raising the threshold by $700), complete with its exclusions and checks?\\nAnd note – this is a standard deduction, not a simple refund of $1,000. The amount you get back depends on your tax rate. For example, someone who pays tax at 30% will get $300 (30% x $1,000) back.\\nTaxpayers will need to complete a tax return to claim the deduction which means that it will be July 2027 at the earliest before they see any benefit.\\nReduction in the bottom rate of income tax\\nFrom July 1, 2026, the tax rate for the lowest tax bracket will be cut from 16 per cent to 15 per cent, which is equivalent to one cent less for every dollar you earn between $18,201 and $45,000. Then, on July 1, 2027, the rate will fall again to 14 per cent. The actual impact on taxpayer’s take-home pay will be limited; it amounts to a tax reduction of $268 from 1 July 2026 and $536 from 1 July 2027.\\nOther measures?\\nThe government deliberately set a “small target” strategy, ruling out more fundamental changes to the tax system. So, there are no proposals to remove or reform the system of negative gearing, no changes to the GST, and no changes to the tax rates or thresholds other than those outline above to the bottom rate.\\nALSO READ: Tax cut for SMEs could yield $10 return for every $1 lost: Report\\nKeep up to date with our stories on\\xa0LinkedIn,\\xa0Twitter,\\xa0Facebook\\xa0and\\xa0Instagram.', 'location': 'AUS', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Australia: Tax changes under Albanese government\\nENTITIES: Anthony Albanese, Labor Party, ATO\\nEVENT: Australia's Labor Party, led by Anthony Albanese, won the election and will implement tax changes including a standard $1,000 tax deduction for work-related expenses and a reduction in the bottom income tax rate.\\nCONTEXT: Taxpayers will see changes to deductions and income tax rates.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 53762, 'sourceId': 12279, 'url': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-white-house-fires-alvin-brown-ntsb/', 'title': 'Trump White House fires Biden-appointed vice chair of NTSB', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T16:52:00.000Z', 'content': \"By\\nKris Van Cleave\\nKris Van Cleave\\nEmmy Award-winning journalist Kris Van Cleave is the senior transportation correspondent for CBS News based in Phoenix, Arizona, where he also serves as a national correspondent reporting for all CBS News broadcasts and platforms.\\nRead Full Bio\\nMay 7, 2025 / 12:52 PM EDT\\n/ CBS News\\nThe vice chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, who was appointed to the post by President Joe Biden late last year, has been fired, a senior White House official confirmed to CBS News.Alvin Brown's ouster happened Tuesday.

And the ramifications for house prices are equally far-reaching.We may need to brace for house price lift-off.And Labor’s overwhelming success on election day has only cemented the bank’s forecast on the trajectory for rates.House prices will surge if rates are slashed to 2.6 per cent over the year. Credit: Peter RaeThere is really only one direction for them to go: down. For house prices, a cut in rates (from the current cash rate of 4.1 per cent) of that magnitude will be an accelerant in a market that is already moving up, albeit at a timid rate. Under this scenario, we could easily see housing prices rising into double-digit territory by year’s end.And the Labor government’s housing policy, aimed at enabling first home owners to get a foothold in the market, will likely further spur demand and fuel house prices.The forces that will motivate the Reserve Bank to lower rates are only getting stronger.Housing is a hot-button issue in Australia, with younger people vying to get a foothold in a market that eludes many thanks to a couple of years of higher rates and declining affordability.A cut in rates will bring out those who have been waiting on the sidelines of the market. However, rising prices will also put pressure on affordability.The NAB expects the Reserve Bank to cut rates by 50 basis points in May, followed by 25 basis points in July, August, November and February.NAB economists forecast rolling rate cuts this year.Credit: Penny StephensThe other major banks are also lining up with forecasts on the Reserve Bank’s lowering of rates, but none are yet suggesting it will move to lower rates at the sort of velocity predicted by the NAB.But the other three banks are all still predicting rates will fall to 3.5 per cent by the middle or end of this calendar year.The forces that will motivate the Reserve Bank to lower rates are only getting stronger.The most recent inflation data showed the consumer price index is inside the central bank’s target range of between 2 and 3 per cent.LoadingBut there is also a risk of the Australian economy slowing after the international ructions created by US President Donald Trump’s tumultuous trade policies. That could spur the RBA to lower rates more quickly than economists are expecting.Meanwhile, there are a number of government programs in place that are designed to help new buyers enter the market. Chief among them will be the policy enabling first home buyers to purchase with just a 5 per cent deposit without having to pay Lenders Mortgage Insurance. Prices on eligible properties will also be lifted and there will be no income caps on numbers.Additionally, there is Labor’s help-to-buy shared equity scheme, where the government covers up to 40 per cent of a home’s cost that first home buyers can buy out at a later date. That could be expanded this year.Of course, Labor also has a policy to increase the number of homes being built, but this demand-side response will be slower to implement due to shortages in skilled tradespeople.LoadingIn the short to medium term, it won’t come close to catching the stimulatory demand created by a combination of lower interest rates and government assistance.However, there is a wild card in any predictions of a tearaway increase in house prices that can’t be ignored.According to research director at Cotality (formerly CoreLogic) Tim Lawless, there could be a financial regulatory response from the likes of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority that may, for example, tighten loan-to-value ratios.So for all Labor’s housing efforts, it’s hard to see much standing in the way of the property price cannonball.The Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

And Bridges was there to stop Tatum, two days after his strip of Jaylen Brown in the waning moments of overtime sent the Knicks to a Game 1 victory.Bridges was again the star, shaking off an 0-for-8 start from the field to score 14 fourth-quarter points. Josh Hart led the Knicks with 23 points and Brunson added 17. Derrick White and Brown each had 20 points for the Celtics, who again were ice-cold from 3-point range, making just 10 of 40.On the strength of a 21-2 run, the Knicks held a three-point lead with 58.5 seconds to go, but Tatum hit two free throws, then split a double-team and flew in for an uncontested slam. But Brunson drew a foul on the other end and sank two clutch free throws.After 24 minutes, the Knicks trailed by nine, but neither team could really be thrilled. The Celtics’ 3-point issues continued with a 5-of-21 shooting display. Tatum missed six of his seven shots, many of them on contested isolations. They let the Knicks hang around despite building a 16-point lead at one point, as Tom Thibodeau’s team started the game with eight empty trips and missed 17 of its first 21 field goal attempts.Meanwhile, the Knicks could’ve played much better. There were eight turnovers leading to 13 Celtics points. They were again hurt on the defensive glass, allowing Boston to outrebound them by eight, and turn nine offensive rebounds into 15 second-chance points. Brunson was off, shooting only 3-of-10, and Bridges missed all six of his field goal attempts.Brown gave the Knicks fits in the opening half, producing 17 points and six rebounds. Towns was the best Knick, scoring 14 points along with 10 boards.

Tatum scored Boston’s first five points of the period and the lead soon ballooned past double figures to the 20-point mark again. Kristaps Porzingis got on the board in the series, throwing down a dunk, then a 3-pointer. It was 73-53, nearly an identical score to Game 1.Much like the series opener, the Knicks did rally, reeling off eight straight points entering the final quarter to get within 12. The similarities continued.The Knicks kept coming, and got as close as four on a Hart basket inside with 3:18 left.

A shadow darts among them: a blackcap, pecking aphids from the underside of the leaves.The insects hatched from overwintering eggs in early April, congregating on loosening bud scales, waiting for tender new leaves to unfurl. Now there are legions of them, aligned along leaf veins, hypodermic stylets plugged in, siphoning sweet sap while simultaneously giving birth to more. They stand with regimented parade-ground spacing, just close enough to stay in touch with their long antennae. A shiver of fidgeting sweeps through the colony as the blackcap approaches.Blackcaps are one of several warbler species that eat sycamore aphids. Photograph: Phil GatesConservationists are quick to point out that sycamore sits close to the bottom of an oft-quoted league table of diversity of insect species hosted by trees, but there is an alternative measure of the tree’s value. That superabundance of a single aphid species contributes to a food web of warblers, tits, hirundines and predatory insects. It’s an ecosystem asset. A 20-metre specimen can host an estimated 2.5 million aphids, diverting its photosynthetic energy into fuelling their own exponential reproductive potential. They in turn fall prey to hoverfly larvae, ladybirds and lacewings. In summer, the winged adults join the aerial plankton hunted by swallows, house martins and swifts. Survivors will lay overwintering eggs in leaf buds, ready for next spring’s population explosion.Sycamore, non-native and invasive, is perhaps our least-loved deciduous tree. As long ago as 1664, John Evelyn, in his Sylva, a treatise on Britain’s trees, despised sycamore for its “honey-dew leaves, which fall … and mar our walks”, and wanted to see it “banished from gardens and avenues”. Motorists might concur if they park in its shade and find cars covered in a sticky film of honeydew, excess tree sap that falls in a constant rain from aphid anuses after they’ve extracted nutrients they need.And yet, for all the species’ purported faults, the felling of the famous Sycamore Gap specimen, a landmark on Hadrian’s Wall familiar to generations of walkers, provoked an outpouring of public\\xa0grief and outrage.

Finding the right controller, however, can be an arduous task. In 2020, Backbone landed on the scene and instantly became a hot favorite for gaming on phones.\\nRecommended Videos\\nOver the years, the company has released two iterations of its One controller, and even one for PlayStation fans. With its latest, the Backbone Pro, the company hopes you won’t look for another controller. From mobile and cloud devices to PC and VR hardware, this is one controller to rule them all.\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\nBackbone went back to the engineering table and made a host of changes to ensure that the Pro can be used in USB-tethered mode, as well as a standalone mode. That mandated a bulk-up, but also introduced perks that gaming enthusiasts will love. The price is still at a premium, but the sum total of this $169.99 package is more than what you would get from an average controller.\\nThoughtful design, stunning build\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\nThe Backbone Pro is bigger and bulkier than its One sibling, though it still tips the scales at under 200 grams. Maneet Khaira, the founding chief of Backbone, tells me that the flagship controller has been in development for over three years and entailed hundreds of 3D-printed prototypes.\\nOver the course of testing, the team performed camera capture to finalize the most comfortable grip, button layout, and even the texture work. The updated thumbsticks required multiple micrometer-level adjustments to get them right.\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\nAll the work that went into design and engineering reflects during usage. I’ve tried nearly half a dozen game controllers in the past few months, including those with a telescoping bar like the Pro. The Backbone controller stands out with its superb build quality and weight balance.\\nA neat touch on the Pro model is the dotted texture on the handle. It’s not rubberized, but it still offers a remarkable surface-level grip. Khaira tells me that the team experimented with multiple laser-etched textures to ensure that it’s not too rough, and doesn’t get the palm sweaty either.\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\nJumping across different venues in Grid Legends in a sweltering 98 degrees Fahrenheit weather, the Backbone Pro did an admirable job at maintaining surface grip against my perspiring palms and prevented slipping.\\nThe handles are thicker this time around, and I quite like them. It’s a personal perk because I’ve grown used to the official Xbox controller and felt right at home with the Backbone Pro. The added heft is also reassuring. In hindsight, it offers a more controlled experience if you are using gyro tilt in racing games.\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\nThe Backbone Pro also throws a couple of customizable rear buttons into the mix. Positioned towards the inner side of the handle, these curved buttons offer a satisfying click feedback and really come in handy for games with crowded controls.\\nThe telescopic bar can fit any smartphone easily, including the big ones like the iPhone 16 Pro Max and Red Magic 10 Pro. It barely falls short of accommodating the iPad mini. Thankfully, the controller won’t cause any trouble if you don’t want to take the case off your phone.\\nThe best-grade inputs out there\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\nFor all that increase in size and heft, the Backbone Pro added a serious functional perk. In addition to using it in tethered mode via the USB-C insert, this one can also act as a standalone wireless controller for all your devices, including TVs, tablets, and laptops.\\nI spent most of my time using the controller in wireless mode, burning up hours in Warframe, Alien: Isolation, and the new Resident Evil titles. I didn’t run into any issues with latency, and the pairing process was also fairly seamless across the screens I tried.\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\nThis dexterity also ties into a continuity feature for gaming. For example, if you left playing a game at a certain point on a large screen, you can seamlessly carry it over on a phone via the official streaming client, such as Xbox Cloud.\\n“We want to support every platform,” Khaira told me during a live demonstration of the Backbone Pro controller. So far, my own experience with playing games across various formats has been fairly smooth and hassle-free.\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\nIn wireless mode, the built-in battery is touted to last 40 hours. I couldn’t verify this number, and honestly, you shouldn’t be concerned about it, either. That’s because the controllers allow parallel charging via the USB-C port on the right handle.\\nWhen plugged in, the port can top up the phone as well as the built-in battery. Technically, I never ran out of juice during my gaming sessions. Thankfully, the companion app conveniently shows the phone and the controller’s battery levels, so you can keep an eye on the drain.\\nA versatile gaming experience\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\nThe buttons and sticks you get on the Backbone Pro are arguably the best you will find on a controller out there. Period. In retrospect, you shouldn’t settle for anything less at this asking price.\\nThe round action buttons offer a nice clicky feedback with a satisfying level of vertical travel, perfect for mashing during your dungeon grinds. The D-Pad, in contrast, offers a quieter response, but they’re really well put together.\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\nThe slight elevation on the edges and a concave profile combine to offer a rewarding circular input for executing combos in fighting games. The Hall Effect triggers, unsurprisingly, perform just as well and keep concerns of drifting at bay.\\nMy favorite element of the controller is the full-sized ALPS joysticks. They have a nice texture around the periphery for extra grip. The pair offers precise movement control, especially in racing games where cornering and hand-brake combos require nimble fingers and subtle radial movements.\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\nYou can calibrate the trigger depth and also configure the thumbstick dead zone. Button remapping is also part of the package, but I wish the app also offered an in-game launcher experience, the way labels like Red Magic have executed.\\nI had a fantastic time gaming with the Backbone Pro and can report that the aspects such as depth sensitivity, response time, and keypress feedback are all top-notch. The only misstep was the occasional bugs in the app, which is to be expected while running a TestFlight build.\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\nIn the stable version that I was running on the Red Magic 10 Pro and OnePlus 13, I didn’t notice any lag or non-responsive buttons. Depending on the platform, you can also save custom key presets and set unique profiles, as well.\\nA rewarding controller app\\nThe most enticing element of the Backbone Pro experience is actually the mobile app. The layout and feel will be second nature to Xbox mobile app users if you’re on Team Green. The app has been beautifully designed, and the content organization is lovely.\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\nGames are neatly sorted across platforms, categories, and the cloud service providers. The app acts more like an aggregator, where you can seamlessly pick up games across Android, iOS, Apple Arcade, Xbox, Nvidia GeForce Now, and other libraries. And yes, you can launch the games directly, as well.\\nThe game cards are dynamic, which means even without tapping on them, you can get a short preview of the gameplay. When I launched the app, I got access to a bunch of freebies with the Backbone+ subscription, such as Discord Nitro and Apple Arcade for three months.\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\nThe biggest surprise? A native emulation tool in the Backbone app. The team has built a unified system where emulation cores for multiple retro Nintendo consoles have been placed in a single container. For now, you can enjoy games for SNES, NES, Game Boy, and Game Boy Advance platforms.\\nThe Backbone chief tells me that the emulation stack will go as far back as Nintendo 64. When I asked about bringing more legacy console platforms, Khaira said it’s not about choosing a side (read: Sony or Nintendo), but technical capabilities. “We want to support every platform,” he put it bluntly.\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\nBackbone is currently testing emulation cores for PlayStation 1, PSP, and Nintendo DS, in case you’re wondering. When I asked him to dig further into the challenges at hand, the Backbone chief told me that the “biggest constraint is memory on the phone.”\\nTying it all together is the Backbone+ subscription, which serves a bunch of exclusive tools and benefits. Priced at $39.99 per year, it offers $35 worth of in-game benefits, a 30% discount on Backbone products, the ability to record game videos at full-HD 60fps with cloud storage, in-app voice chats, and Twitch direct streaming.\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\nThe best, however, is yet to come. Khaira tells me that the subscription bundle will bring more titles and content later this year. “We are working on adding licensed games into the subscription bundle,” he tells me.\\nIn addition to new games, Backbone envisions offering free games as well as instantly playable games that can work offline with the premium bundle. “We want to bring down the barrier of entry as much as possible,” Khaira explains, adding that Backbone hopes to evolve into a gaming platform of its own by working with multiple partners in the gaming industry.\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\n“We are really trying to be an alternative way to play games.”\\n– Maneet Khaira, founder and CEO of Backbone.\\nVerdict\\nThe Backbone Pro is an unabashedly premium controller. But for its $169.99 ask, it inches close to the territory where you find first-party controllers from the console warlords. But where the Backbone option races ahead is the sheer flexibility.\\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends\\nThe buttons and joysticks are fantastic, and so is the flexibility of using it in docked as well as standalone mode across different platforms. From a hardware perspective, it is as good as it gets.\\nIf your preferred gaming platform is mobile devices, and the best experience is what you seek, the Backbone Pro will serve you just fine. It goes a step further by offering a fantastic catalog aggregator in the mobile app. For fans of emulation, the built-in emulator will be a huge draw.\\nThe Backbone One will remain on the shelf at its $99.99 ask, going against the Razer Kishi V2. And if you’re looking for budget alternatives, the GameSir X5 Lite is a great option.

The city of Houston experienced severe flooding in some areas due to the accumulation of historic levels of rainfall. Win McNamee/Getty ImagesCLIMATEWIRE | Many new hospitals, schools, apartment buildings and other structures would be built with extra flood protection under a major revision to an international building code approved Friday.A nonprofit that writes model building codes widely used in the U.S. took a step toward requiring that some newly built structures are constructed well above local flood level — and expanding the areas where elevation is required.“This is transformative,” said Oregon State University engineering professor Daniel Cox, who led an expert panel that wrote and proposed the new flood standards. “It’s going to change how we mitigate floods in the U.S.”On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.The standards were approved overwhelmingly Friday at a hearing in Orlando by a committee of the code-writing group, the International Code Council, despite building industry opposition.The council will take a final vote in 2026 and the new standards would take effect in 2027.The standards would apply only to states and other jurisdictions that adopt them. States are often slow to adopt new building standards. Some are facing pressure from building groups to reject updated standards that would modernize new buildings while increasing construction costs.“Right now, a hospital and fire station are built to the same level of protection as a hot dog stand.” —Rob Moore, senior policy analyst The council committee approval was a victory for flood specialists, environmentalists and insurance groups, who say added construction costs will more than pay for themselves by reducing future flood damage.“This represents a sorely needed critical leap forward in flood resilience,” Aaron Davis, deputy executive director of BuildStrong America, told the committee Friday. The group is a coalition of consumer groups, architects, insurance groups and other advocates of modernized building codes.Chad Berginnis, executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers, said the flood standards would curb growing flood damage worldwide as climate change intensifies storms and development increases in flood zones.The standard was opposed by the National Association of Home Builders, the National Multifamily Housing Council and the American Society for Health Care Engineering.“Our concern with this is that these will increase the cost of construction for new construction,” Jonathan Flannery, the society’s senior associate director of regulatory affairs, told the committee.East Houston Medical Center and Gonzalez Family & Occupational Medicine on I-10 still has water standing during Hurricane Harvey, Wednesday, August 30, 2017.Juan DeLeon/Icon Sportswire via Getty ImagesOne of the standards approved Friday would expand local flood zones so that more structures are subject to elevation requirements.Flannery said the requirement would discourage health care facilities from locating inside flood zones, where elevation requirements would increase construction costs.“If a community is looking at building a facility … and it can be built for 1 percent less outside the flood zone, they’ll do that. Yet the need may be in the flood zone area,” Flannery said.Louisiana State University construction expert Carol Friedland told the committee that the flood standards would increase the number of buildings in flood zones by five percent. They also would impose “modest cost increases” of between 0.5 percent and 2 percent in construction.But the standards would sharply reduce the chances of a building being damaged by flooding, Friedland said.The standards would apply to basic buildings such as residential or commercial structures and to “somewhat critical facilities” such as schools and “critical facilities” including hospitals. The flood standards would be higher for buildings that are more critical.“Right now, a hospital and fire station are built to the same level of protection as a hot dog stand,” Rob Moore, a senior policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told the committee.The committee approved the flood standards three days after a separate council committee rejected a proposal to increase standards for newly built homes.The homebuilders association strongly opposed requiring higher elevation of more homes because of the added construction cost.The association has opposed similar efforts in states and by the federal government under former President Joe Biden.

Here’s one that has been proven to work.\\nA worker assembles components of modular housing in the Capsys factory in the Brooklyn Navy Yard in New York in 2016, shortly before it was repurposed as the Nehemiah Spring Creek housing development.(Richard Levine / Corbis via Getty Images)\\nEzra Klein and Derek Thompson’s new book, Abundance, is riding high on the bestseller lists. The authors argue that something has gone very wrong in our nation: “Over the course of the 20th century, America developed a right that fought government and a left that hobbled it.” They focus on a set of changes—relaxing zoning restrictions, reducing or ending review by local government and environmental agencies, among others—that would make some impact on the current crisis. At the same time, those on the left often propose a massive new investment in what is called social housing. But both sets of proposed solutions miss the mark. And neither addresses an underlying reality that both impedes housing production and explains the growing equity gap between the housing haves and the housing have-nots: the lack of a robust strategy for affordable home building.\\nThe two celebrated political analysts admit to being liberals and confess that their primary audience is the Democratic Party. I wish them luck. I worry, however, that they and those on the left are underestimating the power of the current culture they seek to transform.\\nMy colleagues and I know how powerful this culture is because we have been fighting it for 40 years. When we proposed building housing on vast tracts of vacant and abandoned New York City land—first in East Brooklyn, then in the South Bronx—we met with a top civic official, who listened impatiently before replying, “Your eyes are bigger than your stomachs.”\\nAs it turned out, our stomachs were big. We ultimately built thousands of affordable houses, called Nehemiah homes, in East Brooklyn and the South Bronx that working people could buy and maintain.\\nWe didn’t call it “abundance.” We called it critical mass: building at scale, with speed. This ran against the then-conventional wisdom that the way to rebuild cities was by sprinkling a few new units here and a few new units there.\\nBuilding at scale replaced all the negative chain reactions—abandonment, business flight, crime, despair, nihilism—with a constructive chain reaction of ownership, wealth creation, retail growth, upgraded parks, improved health and education indicators, hope and more. We succeeded. Though it took longer than it should have.\\nCurrent Issue\\nThe problem was not primarily hobbling from the left that the authors describe, nor resistance from the right—not that there was much of a right in New York. The issue was that the Nehemiah effort’s proven success—the transformation of entire blocks—was not adopted in other cities without enormous pressure from our local leaders and institutions.\\nHere’s why.\\nFirst, a consensus developed that the best way to build affordable housing is through tax credits—which favor renting over owning. This does nothing to close the terrible equity gap throughout our country. A coalition of developers, nonprofits, consultants, housing intermediaries, elected and appointed officials, and financial institutions—all of which benefit from the reliance on tax credits—has dominated the discussion of building affordable housing in recent decades. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program unlocks private investment in low-income housing efforts. The New Market Tax Credit approach does the same for those interested in financing businesses, daycare centers, charter schools, and other community amenities. Neither provides a path to ownership and equity for those on the economic margins. These approaches are constructive and create some impact. But they have become comfortable monopolies, blandly accepted by many as the only way to rebuild communities.\\nSecond, institutions charged with producing this housing—including the Federal Home Loan Banks, the billion-dollar intermediaries like Enterprise and the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, the multibillion-dollar foundations that funnel through these intermediaries—have amassed fortunes, paid their executives handsomely, and opted for safe and predictable housing strategies. Meanwhile, they have done little to address the housing production crisis—even as millions of Americans remain plagued by housing scarcity.\\nThird, lack of leadership. Klein and Thompson rightly decry a policy universe filled with lawyers:\\nIn the Democratic Party, every presidential and vice-presidential nominee from Walter Mondale to Kamala Harris (Tim Walz, in this respect, was an almost radical break with tradition) attended law school. [W]hen you make legal training the default training for a political career, you make legal thinking the default thinking in politics. And legal thinking centers around statutory language and commitment to process, not results and outcomes.\\nAmen.\\nFourth, what Klein and Thompson mostly miss is the role of third-sector organizations in the robust effort to transform our political culture. At the Industrial Areas Foundation, we understood from day one that our ability to succeed had nothing to do with the quality of our plans or the design of our homes or, as Klein and Thompson describe it, “a new theory of supply.”\\nPopular\\n“swipe left below to view more authors”Swipe →\\nInstead, it had everything to do with whether we had the power to make mayors and governors respond to our demands, and enough persistence to keep them responding over years and decades. When we began the rebuilding of East Brooklyn and the South Bronx, we didn’t begin with an attempt to alter zoning regulations or to wait for what one deputy mayor recommended when we said that the Koch administration lacked a housing strategy. He said, “Yes, we do. It’s called federal money.”\\nIf we had taken him seriously, we would still be waiting; thousands of minority homebuyers would still be stuck in substandard rental and public housing, and nearly $2 billion in equity would never have been created. Instead, we began with a power analysis of the city at the time. We raised our own no-interest construction financing—something the left never does. And we persuaded Koch to make an unprecedented investment of city funds in our effort and the efforts of others. Then, policy changed—in response to the power of the organization and our growing track record of success. No matter what new theory or consensus emerges, the fundamental role that power, and powerful organizations, play will still be key.\\nForty years after we began building in East Brooklyn, 20 years after its success was obvious to just about anyone who looked, our affiliates in Chicago, United Power for Action and Justice, and in Baltimore, BUILD, have finally begun to build at the pace and scale needed to reclaim the depopulated stretches of those cities. Apparently, there is still an appetite for a major push toward new and even bigger critical masses of affordable ownership housing.\\nOur New York Metro Industrial Areas Foundation affiliates will increase the pressure until that appetite grows. But mayors and governors and others need to match or exceed the kinds of commitments that an initially reluctant Ed Koch made. We know from experience that this combination of organized citizen power and responsive local leadership can make all the difference—and actually get affordable housing built.\\nMike Gecan\\nMike Gecan worked as an organizer and then national codirector of the Industrial Areas Foundation for more than four decades.

It's the first time she has testified\", 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T19:18:29.000Z', 'content': \"NEW YORK -- Days into Harvey Weinstein 's first sexual assault trial in 2020, prosecutors privately spoke for the first time with a former model who alleged that he had forced oral sex on her. But that jury was never told about Kaja (KEYE’-ah) Sokola's claim. Prosecutors have said they still were investigating the allegation when Weinstein, a onetime movie tycoon-turned- #MeToo pariah, was convicted in February 2020 of charges based on other women's accusations.On Wednesday, Sokola began to tell a new jury her story. Sokola didn't look at Weinstein as she walked past him and onto the witness stand in a Manhattan courtroom where he's on trial again. An appeals court overturned his 2020 rape and sexual assault conviction, sending those charges back for retrial, and prosecutors subsequently added another sexual assault charge based on Sokola's allegations. As she began testifying about her life before the alleged 2006 assault, Weinstein looked toward her, with his right hand across his mouth.Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty to all the charges. His lawyers contend that his accusers consented to sexual encounters with him in hopes of getting movie and TV opportunities, and the defense has emphasized that the women stayed in contact with him for a while after the alleged assaults.The women, meanwhile, say the Oscar-winning producer used the prospect of show business work to prey on them.The Polish-born Sokola, 39, sued Weinstein after industry whispers about his behavior toward women became a chorus of public accusations in 2017, fueling the #MeToo movement and its calls for accountability for sexual misconduct. Prosecutors have said Sokola eventually received $3.5 million in compensation.She was introduced to Weinstein while on a modeling trip to New York in 2002, when she was 16, according to prosecutors. In her lawsuits, Sokola said that shortly after she met Weinstein, he invited her to lunch to discuss her career but then sexually assaulted her. The lawsuits alleged he sexually harassed and emotionally abused her for years afterward.The criminal charge stems from one instance when Sokola maintains that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in a Manhattan hotel in May 2006. Prosecutors have said it happened after Weinstein arranged for Sokola to be an extra in the film “The Nanny Diaries” and met her visiting older sister, whom she was trying to impress. “She was proud of knowing him,” her sister, cardiologist Dr. Ewa (pronounced EH’-vah) Sokola, told jurors Wednesday.She said the three of them met in a hotel lobby, chatted for about an hour about Italian movies and the heavyset Weinstein's heart health, and then he and the model left the table together.Kaja Sokola was tense when she returned about a half-hour later — “like somebody waiting for the result of an exam” or the Oscars — but didn't say anything about the alleged sexual assault, Dr. Sokola told jurors.She said she was shocked to learn about the claim over a decade later, when she read about it in a magazine article.Weinstein's lawyers will get a chance to question Kaja Sokola in the coming days. In an opening statement last month, defense attorney Arthur Aidala questioned why she waited years to come forward. Prosecutors have argued that accusers were reluctant to speak up because of Weinstein's wealth and influence.Prosecutors have said Sokola's attorneys contacted them on the eve of Weinstein's first trial to say she was willing to be interviewed. Prosecutors have said they soon spoke with her and began investigating, but didn't initially pursue charges because Weinstein was convicted and the coronavirus pandemic loomed.They revived the Sokola investigation after New York's highest court reversed Weinstein's conviction. Weinstein's lawyers fought unsuccessfully to keep Sokola's allegation out of the retrial. They accused prosecutors of “smuggling an additional charge into the case for the improper purpose of bolstering the credibility” of other accusers. One of the others, Miriam Haley, testified last week that Weinstein forced oral sex on her in 2006. The third accuser in the case, Jessica Mann, is expected to testify later.The Associated Press generally does not name sexual assault accusers without their permission, which Haley, Mann and Sokola have given.\", 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Ex-model testifies in Harvey Weinstein retrial\\nENTITIES: Harvey Weinstein, Kaja Sokola, Miriam Haley, Jessica Mann\\nEVENT: Kaja Sokola testified in Harvey Weinstein's retrial, alleging he forced oral sex on her in 2006; this is the first time she has testified.\\nCONTEXT: Weinstein's 2020 conviction was overturned, leading to this retrial.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 51031, 'sourceId': 12628, 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/d2d9afed-9fb1-4b21-90a4-fbfd5391c528', 'title': 'UK looking at setting up youth mobility scheme with EU, minister says', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T04:00:58.000Z', 'content': 'Unlock the Editor’s Digest for freeRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.Nick Thomas-Symonds, European relations minister, has confirmed publicly for the first time that Britain is looking at setting up a youth mobility scheme as part of a new “strategic partnership” with the EU, to be launched at a summit this month.Days after Nigel Farage’s anti-EU Reform UK delivered a bloody nose to Labour in local elections, Thomas-Symonds used an interview with the Financial Times to prepare the ground for a politically contentious deal with Brussels at a summit in London on May 19.The summit will agree a new UK-EU security and defence pact, increasing co-operation on procurement and training. But it will also set in train months of negotiations on a wide-ranging package of economic reforms and on the creation of some kind of youth experience scheme.Thomas-Symonds, who is heading ministerial “reset” efforts, previously insisted there were “no plans” for a youth mobility scheme, a key EU demand that would enable young adults from member states to study and work in the UK and vice versa. But on Tuesday he said that provided the UK government’s red lines were respected, “a smart, controlled youth mobility scheme would of course have benefits for our young people”.Ministers have indicated privately that they would cap numbers in any scheme and make it time limited, and Thomas-Symonds confirmed: “We will consider sensible EU proposals in this space.”He said Sir Keir Starmer, prime minister, had made it clear Britain would not return to free movement or rejoin the customs union or single market. The government was also committed to bringing down net migration, he added.But Thomas-Symonds said Britain already had youth mobility deals with countries including Australia and Uruguay, adding: “Nobody is suggesting any of those schemes, smart and controlled, are about freedom of movement.”Thomas-Symonds also suggested Britain would be prepared to allow EU fishermen to continue to enjoy current access to UK waters when a five-year agreement expires in 2026.He said it would have to be part of a wider deal to secure easier access for British fishermen selling their catch on the continent. “We are looking for an overall arrangement that is beneficial to our fishers,” he said.Thomas-Symonds left open the door to Britain continuing to align with EU rules in food standards and animal welfare, saying: “We are not interested in divergence for divergence sake or a race to the bottom on standards.”He also indicated Britain was prepared to accept a role for the European Court of Justice as part of a deal to cut red tape on cross-channel trade. “You would expect there to be an appropriate dispute resolution mechanism,” he said.Asked if he feared a backlash from Farage and Kemi Badenoch’s Conservatives, Thomas-Symonds said he looked forward to presenting the benefits of an accord to voters, who rejected Labour and the Tories in local elections in England last week. “I don’t worry about selling something that we believe would make the UK more secure and more prosperous,” he said. “This is a package for which we have a strong mandate from the British people. We need to move on from the debates of the past; this is forward-looking. It’s where the European continent is in the mid-2020s, not where it was in 2016.”Badenoch has already claimed that a youth mobility deal risks creating “another avenue which people might use to game the system”, while warning that Starmer was about to “sell out” British fishermen.After Reform’s gains last week, Thomas-Symonds’ comments are the prelude to a major political offensive by Starmer and other ministers to explain why closer EU ties will bring benefits to voters.Thomas-Symonds talked repeatedly about a “package” of reforms that he claimed would be popular with the public, from cutting red tape at borders in order to bring down food prices to making it easier for professionals or touring musicians to work on the continent.On a defence deal, he said: “At this moment in European history it’s not in the interests of the European continent to have fragmentation of our defence industrial capacity.”Asked whether Britain might at some point rejoin the Erasmus student exchange programme, Thomas-Symonds did not rule it out. “We don’t have plans to return to Erasmus,” he said. “But we are always open to listening to sensible proposals from the EU, but they have to be within the framework we’ve set out.” He said any closer ties to Europe had to be “part of a package which is in the national interest”.London has refused to cut university tuition fees for EU students to UK levels and any change to that policy would come with a considerable price tag. In the last seven-year Erasmus cycle, the UK contributed €2bn more than it received because more EU students used it than British ones.Additional reporting by Andy Bounds in Brussels', 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: UK considers youth mobility scheme with EU\\nENTITIES: UK, EU, Nick Thomas-Symonds, Keir Starmer, Nigel Farage, Kemi Badenoch\\nEVENT: The UK government is exploring a youth mobility scheme with the EU, allowing young adults to study and work in both regions, and is open to discussing continued access to UK waters for EU fishermen as part of a wider trade deal.\\nCONTEXT: The UK is considering a youth mobility scheme with the EU as part of a broader strategic partnership, aiming to improve relations post-Brexit.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 50659, 'sourceId': 12612, 'url': 'https://www.ft.com/content/f2a5e12f-0599-4f7d-a3ec-6db7050df2a0', 'title': 'UK and EU split over youth mobility deal, negotiating document shows', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T18:06:07.000Z', 'content': 'The UK and the EU are deeply split over the terms of a youth mobility scheme that is a key part of a post-Brexit “reset” agreement, fresh negotiating documents show.\\xa0With only two weeks to go until a crucial London summit kicking off formal negotiations, the two remain far apart on a deal to allow 18 to 30-year-olds on both sides of the Channel to travel and work more freely in each other’s countries.The EU is demanding a “dedicated visa” to enable young people to work, study or “simply travel” in the UK as long as they have sufficient funds, according to a draft document discussed by EU ambassadors on Wednesday. It also proposes that EU students should return to paying the same £9,535 fees to attend British universities as home students.A UK “counterproposal” suggests the two sides “explore” a much narrower scheme that is “time-limited [and] capped” and would mean visitors had “no right to bring dependants or access benefits”, the document adds. The UK government has repeatedly rejected Brussels’ version of a youth mobility deal arguing that it is too close to restoring the “free movement of people” that was ended by the 2016 Brexit vote.\\xa0Instead, the UK said it would push for a deal to improve the rights for musicians and other touring artists. The proposed text says only that the European Commission proposes to “provide clear information to artists” on rules they need to comply with.Brussels also wants the UK to work towards rejoining the “Erasmus+” student exchange programme, the document states — though European relations minister Nick Thomas-Symonds this week told the Financial Times there were no plans to rejoin. At their summit on May 19 at Lancaster House, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will announce a new security and defence partnership, alongside a plan for a new EU-UK “common understanding”.The documents set out plans to deepen co-operation in areas including energy, emissions trading, co-operation on crime fighting and tackling illegal migration, along with removing barriers to trade in food and animal products.The UK has asked for “more flexibility” than EU countries to impose controls on food and plant imports. But the document states that the UK must accept so-called “dynamic alignment” that would result in it automatically following EU rules, and requests an “adequate financial contribution” to pay for the EU’s work in that area.\\xa0In a win for London, it adds that any food agreement will be governed by an “independent arbitration panel”, which avoids the European Court of Justice having direct jurisdiction over the UK.London officials would be involved in early stage drafting of new laws covered by dynamic alignment, in a sign that any veterinary deal following EU rules will inevitably pull the two sides closer together.\\xa0The UK would also be required to make “adequate financial contribution” to any European emissions trading system if the pair chose to link their separate programmes, the document states. Beyond the disagreements on trade and mobility, the two sides will also agree on an expansive security and defence partnership that will create regular meetings, repairing what one UK diplomat called the “institutional rupture” caused by Brexit.\\xa0According to the draft text, the UK and EU will establish a six-monthly “foreign policy dialogue” between the British foreign secretary and the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs.\\xa0The EU will also “regularly” invite the UK to high-level meetings, including the quarterly meetings of the European Council of EU leaders, alongside an annual defence dialogue, training exchanges and possible staff secondments.\\xa0A UK government spokesperson said any final deal would be in “the national interest”, adding: “These are EU internal draft texts.

But there’s still changes to be made to the game in the meantime.\\nRecommended Videos\\nA new update going live tonight adds an interesting quality-of-life update that I didn’t know I needed, but now I’m thankful for it because it just makes sense. It’s also a great example of some of the small changes that help make a liveservice game that much more. Screenshot by Destructoid The issue in question? The emote and spray wheel. NetEase Games says the May 8 update for the game will now split it into two separate wheels, one for emotes and one for sprays, instead of having them both on the same button. Hotkeys can be assigned for the separate options. Not only that, but a new option will allow you to set your spray wheel to be shared across all heroes, which is my favorite part of this update. I cannot be bothered to go into each hero and customize the sprays, which are also in big need of organization options in the future. Now, I can have the spray I want in the same slot across every hero. And if you don’t want the uniformity, you can keep things as is no problem. In short, it’s a welcome change, even if it wasn’t actually a problem to begin with. In similar games, sprays and emotes also have their own buttons, so this type of change is a no-brainer, now that I do think about it. The hard part, though, will be un-learning all of the muscle memory used in the game over its first five months since launch. I shudder at the thought. And hey, while we’re talking about quality-of-life changes, Marvel Rivals could also do well with a “play of the game” feature like and killcams like Overwatch 2 has, because what’s the point of a good spray or emote if I can’t use it to taunt my enemies after I pop off with a team wipe? Come on, NetEase, get it together. You can check out the full list of changes on the game’s official website.\\nPost Tag:\\nDestructoid is supported by our audience.

From 1961 to 1983, the U.S.’s old space race rival launched 16 probes, Venera 1 through Venera 16, that either flew by, orbited, or landed on Venus—with three of them failing en route. It’s been decades since the Russians bothered with Venus, but this week, an artifact from that long-ago space program may very well bother us: Sometime between May 9 and May 11, an 1,100-lb Venus spacecraft known as Kosmos 482, which has been stuck in Earth orbit since 1972, will come crashing back to the ground, potentially threatening anyone on Earth living between 52° North and 52° South of the equator—which covers the overwhelming share of us. Here’s what you need to know.Kosmos 482 was originally intended to be known as Venera 9. It was launched on March 31, 1972, just four days after its sister probe, Venera 8. That ship had a brief but glorious life. It arrived at Venus on July 22, 1972, spent close to an hour descending through the atmosphere, and landed at 6:24 a.m. local Venus time. (Local time on another world is calculated the same way it is on Earth—by measuring the angle of the sun relative to the meridians, or lines of longitude.)Once on the ground, Venera 8 lived for only 63 minutes, which is about what was expected given Venus’s hellish conditions. The atmospheric pressure is 93 times greater than it is on Earth, with a sea level pressure of 1,350 pounds per square inch (psi) compared to just 14.7 psi here. The air is mostly carbon dioxide, which, together with Venus's greater proximity to the sun, means an average temperature 860°F—or more than 200 degrees hotter than the melting point of lead.That was the future that awaited Venera 9 too, but things didn’t work out for what turned out to be a snakebit ship. After reaching Earth orbit, it fired its engine to enter what is known as a Venus transfer trajectory; that engine burn went awry, however, either cutting off too soon or not reaching a sufficient thrust to send the spacecraft on its way. Instead, it remained in an elliptical Earth orbit, with an apogee, or high point, of 560 miles, and a perigee, or low point, of 130 miles. There it has remained for the past 53 years. For its pains, Venera 9 lost not only its mission but its name. Abiding by Soviet-era nomenclature rules, spacecraft that remain in orbit around the Earth are dubbed Kosmos, followed by a number—in this case, Kosmos 482.In 2022, Marco Langbroek, a Dutch archaeologist who toggled over to sky watching mid-career and now lectures on space situational awareness at The Netherlands’ Delft Technical University, completed a round of tracking Kosmos 482's orbit. In The Space Review, he wrote that the object would reenter Earth’s atmosphere sometime in 2025 or 2026, due to the steady accumulation of drag by the atmosphere’s upper reaches. Further tracking of the spacecraft’s trajectory—by Langbroek, NASA, and the nonprofit Aerospace Corporation—now predicts the reentry will occur on May 10, at 12:42 a.m., plus or minus 19 hours.“The reentry is an uncontrolled reentry,” Langbroek wrote on his website on April 24. “It likely will be a hard impact. I doubt the parachute deployment system will still work after 53 years and with dead batteries.”Medallion which was delivered to the surface of planet Venus by the soviet space probe Venera 3 on March 1, 1966. Universal Images Group—GettyOrdinarily, even a spacecraft as big as Kosmos 482 would not pose much danger to people on the ground. The same atmospheric friction that causes most meteors to burn up before they reach the surface disposes of errant satellites the same way. It is mostly far larger objects, like the U.S.’s Skylab space station—which reentered in July, 1979, scattering debris across the Australian outback—that cause concern. But Kosmos 482 is different; it was intentionally designed to withstand Venus’s pressure-cooker atmosphere, and even colliding with our own atmosphere at orbital speeds of 17,500 miles per hour, it could at least partly survive its plunge.“The risks involved are not particularly high, but not zero,” Langbroek writes. “With a mass of just under 500 kg and 1-meter size, risks are somewhat similar to that of a meteorite impact.”All of the land masses in Earth’s southern hemisphere are within the reentry footprint, along with the large majority of the north. Most of Russia, the U.K. the Balkans, Scandinavia, Canada, and Alaska are among the few places out of harm’s way.\\xa0Still, nobody is recommending calling the pets inside and crouching in fallout shelters. More than 70% of the Earth’s surface is water, meaning a 70% chance of a splashdown as opposed to a hard landing. What’s more, the landmasses in the reentry zone include largely unpopulated areas like the Sahara, Atacama, and Australian deserts.\\xa0It would, of course, be best if Kosmos 482 disintegrates entirely on reentry, but space sentimentalists are hoping that at least a bit of it survives. Venera probes, like all of the Soviet spacecraft sent to the moon and the planets, carried along with them small memorial coins, medals and titanium pennants—embossed with the hammer and sickle, the likeness of Lenin, the Earth, and more. Kosmos 482 will return to a world very different from the one it left—with the Soviet Union itself consigned to history. This week, after more than half a century, a bit of commemorative metal just may survive the empire that sent it aloft.\", 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Soviet Venus spacecraft to crash back to Earth\\nENTITIES: Soviet Union, Kosmos 482, Venera, NASA, Aerospace Corporation, Marco Langbroek\\nEVENT: Kosmos 482, a Venus-bound spacecraft stuck in Earth orbit since 1972, is predicted to reenter Earth's atmosphere around May 10, 2024, potentially scattering debris across a wide swath of the globe.\\nCONTEXT: Soviet-era spacecraft's reentry poses minimal but non-zero risk.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 51962, 'sourceId': 12729, 'url': 'https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/tv/eastenders-fans-convinced-lauren-peters-31593684', 'title': \"EastEnders fans convinced Lauren and Peter's baby named after former soap actor 'in tribute'\", 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T19:05:21.000Z', 'content': 'Manchester Evening News IconNewsTVEastEndersThe actor in question was working on the programme for 11 years20:05, 07 May 2025The baby arrived as Lauren connected with an unlikely figure(Image: BBC)EastEnders fans are convinced that Lauren Branning and Peter Beale’s baby is named after one of the show’s former actors.It’s been a period of departures on the BBC soap, with Sonia Fowler and Bianca Jackson both leaving last month after joining the programme in 1993.\\u200cOn top of this, viewers are still getting used to life without Martin Fowler and Reiss Colwell, who both died after an explosion at the Queen Vic in February’s 40th anniversary week.\\u200cWhile Ross Marshall and his son Joel arrived in April with a returning Vicki Fowler, fans have been desperate for new faces to show up in Walford.In scenes that aired on Wednesday night (May 8), Cindy Beale had to take matters into her own hands to get Lauren to hospital when their ambulance was delayed.Despite Cindy and Lauren being at odds before the former was bribed to leave Albert Square in February, they joined forces to get through the ordeal.Article continues belowPrior to Cindy’s affair with Junior Knight being exposed at Christmas, Lauren’s future-mum-in-law was supplying her with drugs in order to get easy money.Cindy Beale helped her former enemy Lauren through labour(Image: BBC)After returning to the show on Monday (May 5), Cindy showed a rare kind side as she shared a heart-to-heart with Lauren at the hospital.\\u200cWith the baby\\'s dad and her fianceé Peter nowhere to be seen, Lauren admitted that she feared the implications her addiction would have on her newborn.Lauren went on to give birth to a healthy baby, with Ian, Kathy and Peter Beale eventually arriving and ordering Cindy to leave.In spite of Cindy being there for Lauren when no one else was, Peter told his mum that he’s adamant he doesn’t want her in his life moving forward.\\u200cPeter and Lauren went on to arrive at a unanimous dedication to name their baby boy Jim Branning, as Cindy told Ian and Kathy that she was coming for their businesses.The name Jim Branning has caused debate among EastEnders fans on X, with many assuming it\\'s after Lauren\\'s late grandfather who was married to Dot Cotton.However, Martin Fowler actor James Bye was nicknamed Jimmy by his castmates, which many fans pointed out on the app previously known as Twitter.Article continues below@CallumWhitee_ said: “Why have they called it Jimmy?

Its effective military resistance against a much stronger adversary is in fact underpinned by this successful economic management. Rather than face institutional sclerosis or even collapse, Ukraine’s state capacity has been strengthened by the conflict. Through a combination of tax revenue collection and substantial networks of voluntary fundraising, the state has dramatically increased the size of its armed forces, invested in defence production and maintained a decent level of public infrastructure.State spending on soldiers’ wages, infrastructure and logistics – including public sector procurement from private firms – has had a positive knock-on effect, supporting demand in the civilian market economy. Soldiers on the frontline earn well above the national average wage. An innovative military industrial complex, combining traditional state-owned enterprises with an ecosystem of drone startups, has been developed. These policies have stabilised the Ukrainian economy and directed it to the goal of the country’s basic survival.But while Ukraine must be credited with these successes, it still lacks the resources domestically to meet the enormous costs of the war. External financial support has been vital to keeping the country afloat. Its wartime resilience is in this sense built on a contradiction: state capacity has grown considerably, but it has done so through a fundamental dependence on foreign financial assistance. Ukraine records a negative gross domestic savings rate, for example – an indicator of an economy that is consuming (including military spending) more each year than its annual economic output. This is made possible thanks to financial aid from Ukraine’s allies.As I argue in my recent report, Russo-Ukrainian War: The Political Economy of the Present Balance of Forces, despite this dependency, Ukraine has made the best of the situation, and Russia’s economic position is less strong than it is often portrayed.Russia’s economy is often seen as the success story of the all-out war – and it certainly defied expectations that it would descend into crisis under the effects of western sanctions. But this apparent strength disguises its fundamental dependency – not on its allies, but on fossil fuels. With oil and gas accounting for 30% to 50% of Russia’s government revenues over the past decade, and generating profits that sustain much of the rest of the economy, Russia is fundamentally a petrostate.In 2022, the global oil price spike helped Russia stabilise its economy. But with demand for oil now falling, its room for manoeuvre on the home front has narrowed. The trade-offs between the war and civilian economies will now become harder to manage.Longer-term supply and demand trends in global oil markets also pose a critical problem for Russia. The International Energy Agency predicts that over the next five years, the world will face an unprecedented supply glut, upending the price-setting power of petrostates and weakening the Russian economy.Unlike Ukraine, which has secured foreign financial assistance until 2027 in the form of aid and loans, Russia is running down liquid assets in its national wealth fund to finance its military. As the war persists, problems are developing in the Russian economy: a falling current-account surplus, rising inflation, high interest rates and a banking system put under strain by these growing contradictions. Ukraine’s inflation-adjusted central bank rate is now actually far lower than Russia’s, putting it in the peculiar position of being the country where the war is being fought, while also having a more stable monetary and banking system.On paper, Ukraine appears to be in the stronger economic position. But the recent minerals agreement with the United States complicates that assessment, offering a stark reminder of the country’s basic dependency on its allies.The deal creates a joint investment fund to access Ukraine’s mineral wealth, but on terms that are advantageous to the US. Ukraine will contribute half of all revenues from new mineral licences to capitalise the fund, without any equivalent obligation for the US to match these contributions. Yet, despite this inequity, Washington retains 50% control over decision-making. The deal even envisages that US military aid would be considered as a form of capitalisation of the fund, potentially giving the US a legal claim on future profits without having contributed any investment capital.The deal has been widely seen as a victory for Ukraine, owing to how earlier iterations contained far more onerous terms. In a win for Kyiv, those proposals have been dropped. But the final agreement still bears the marks of the raw colonialism of the original vision.From a commercial standpoint, the deal may not even work. Mineral extraction is notoriously high-risk and capital-intensive. Potential investors in projects created under the auspices of the fund will have to weigh up the political risks. A future Ukrainian government might repudiate the framework altogether – especially if the EU makes a better offer. Given that investments are already risky in Ukraine and some of the country’s mineral assets are under occupation, there is widespread scepticism that the fund will amount to much in practice.This may well help explain why Ukraine chose to sign the agreement: it has a primarily symbolic value, anchoring the US back in the camp of Ukraine supporters. Ukrainian officials point to the concessions they won: that the US formally recognises Russia as the aggressor in the war; has agreed to negotiate future changes required to make the fund compatible with Ukraine’s EU obligations if it were to join the bloc in the future in “good faith”; and acknowledges that the Ukrainian constitution explicitly places mineral assets in the hands of the Ukrainian people. Importantly, then, the deal could be rewritten if the EU demands it.Still, the narrative matters. The minerals agreement is a grim formalisation of the Trump administration’s view of international relations as coercive bullying, or what it calls “great power competition”. A country fighting for its democracy and sovereignty should not have to trade away its strategic resources. But the deal is about Ukraine playing for time and maintaining some level of US support for its war of self-defence. With Russia’s war machine facing the ticking clock of oil price declines, time might even be on Ukraine’s side.\\nLuke Cooper is an associate professorial research fellow in international relations at LSE Ideas, the in-house foreign policy thinktank of the London School of Economics and Political Science, and the director of PeaceRep’s Ukraine programme\\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Nerazzurri reached their second final in three season, after losing the 2023 edition in the 1-0 final against Pep Guardiola's Manchester City, and they have the chance to win their fourth ever Champions League trophy, after winning the last one in 2010 under Jose Mourinho at the end of the historical season when Inter won the treble. PSG, on the other side, are yet to win their first Champions League trophy, and they will play their second ever final of the tournament after losing 1-0 in the 2020 edition against Bayern Munich with the deciding goal scored by Kingsley Coman.\\xa0The team coached by Luis Enrique were able to reach the final after knocking out Arsenal in the two-legged semifinals, as the French giants won 1-0 in London before winning 2-1 the return leg in Paris on Wednesday, thanks to the goals scored by Fabian Ruiz and former Inter winger Achraf Hakimi. The Nerazzurri, on the other hand, managed to eliminate Barcelona in the semifinals after knocking out Bayern Munich in the quarterfinals, as Simone Inzaghi's side played one of the most memorable Champions League ties in the history of the game, and at the end managed to win 4-3 the return leg with the winning goal scored by Davide Frattesi after drawing 3-3 in Barcelona in the first game. Both sides are full of talents and players that can decide the final at any moment, but let's take a look at the top five players that will feature in the Champions League final this season:\\xa0How to watch the Champions League final, oddsDate: Saturday, May 31 |\\xa0Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Allianz Arena -- Munich, GermanyTV:\\xa0CBS |\\xa0Live stream:\\xa0Paramount+Odds:\\xa0Paris Saint-Germain +105; Draw +240; Inter +2705. GK Yann Sommer, Inter\\xa0It wasn't easy to pick the best goalkeeper, especially considering the incredible performances of PSG player Gianluigi Donnarumma against Liverpool in the round of 16 and then in the quarterfinals against Aston Villa. Yann Sommer been absolutely impressive, especially in the first leg of the Arsenal matchup in London. However, the Swiss goalkeeper showed out, especially against Barcelona in the two-legged semifinals, proving he is one of the best players around Europe. His incredible saves, in particular the one on Lamine Yamal at San Siro in the second leg played in Milan, showed why Inter decided to sign him to replace Andre Onana in the summer of 2023.\\n4. Achraf Hakimi, PSGThe PSG winger played for the Italian side during the 2020-21 season under Antonio Conte, when he was the Inter manager. His impact in the Italian Serie A was outstanding, and his performances led the Nerazzurri to win their first Scudetto in 11 years before PSG decided to sign him in the summer of 2021 for around $70 million, add-ons included. The Nerazzurri, after his departure, replaced him with Dutch winger Denzel Dumfries, who improved a lot and he's now close to the level of Achraf Hakimi, but still not quite there. The Moroccan star can be considered as one of the best players around the world, and he will have the chance to lift the trophy in front of his former teammates and fans after scoring the deciding goal of the semifinals tie against Arsenal in Paris.\\n3. Lautaro Martinez, InterThe Inter captain has been incredible this season, and he also showed why last year as he was named seventh in voting for the Ballon d'Or. Winning the Champions League would be the only trophy he still hasn't won so far in his career, and his quick recovery ahead of the second leg of the semifinals against Barcelona showed how much he wants to achieve it, starting six days after suffering a muscular injury in the match played in Barcelona. Compared to the 2023 final against Manchester City, when he was playing alongside Edin Dzeko and Romelu Lukaku, his new teammate, Marcus Thuram, has helped Lautaro Martinez to improve his goal records and performances.\\n2. Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, PSGKhvicha Kvaratskhelia to PSG has been by far the best signing of the 2025 January transfer window and possibly one of the best ever made in the winter transfer session. The former Napoli winger has been able to prove himself in a very short time in France as well, and since he joined Luis Enrique's team, he scored four goals and provided six assists, but most notably, he was able to show all his talent and quickly gained a starting place in the team. He will be the most talented player on both teams in that game, and he's the one to watch for individual brilliance.\\n1. Ousmane Dembele, PSGThere is one PSG with Ousmane Dembele on the pitch, and there is one without him. If the French winger will be fit at the best of his form in the 2025 final, there is no much Inter can do to contain him, even if the the Nerazzurri were able to face both Lamine Yamal and Raphinha in the semifinals. His numbers this season are absolutely incredible as he already scored 33 goals, 13 assists and has scored one goal every 92 minutes played over the 44 games in all competitions.

The company of Here We Are, Stephen Sondheim’s final musical, are off-book and getting the first act on its feet. But hitting your cues in a show as intricate as this is tough, whoever you are.Jane Krakowski fluffs an entrance and tries not to corpse. Martha Plimpton raises a glass a second after everyone else, and a cast-mate blows a raspberry from the sidelines. Jesse Tyler Ferguson is convinced it’s not him who is a beat off. “Do it exactly like Rory does,” suggests director Joe Mantello, and Rory Kinnear responds mock-haughtily: “That’s just a general note.”Sondheim’s songs can be notoriously tricky to perform. Ferguson, best known for his role as Mitchell in the sitcom Modern Family, found the New York premiere of this work “hypnotic” when he saw it. “And now I realise they spent weeks just learning how to speak these things, and how hard that is.” Combining the verbal rhythmic patterns with the show’s ever-moving choreography is, says Mantello, like patting your head while rubbing your stomach.The good news: after three weeks it is already very funny. Denis O’Hare – he and Tracie Bennett return from the original production – is nailing his scene. Even with 129 performances in the bank, he is still making his director laugh with fresh takes on a desperate-to-please waiter. At the back of the room, awaiting his entrance, a dead chef lies on a trolley, suitably garnished.When Here We Are opened off-Broadway in October 2023 it was the hottest ticket in town (not unlike Mantello’s 2004 Assassins, which won a Tony). A collaboration between Sondheim, Mantello and writer David Ives, it had been in development for seven years when Sondheim died, aged 91, and was completed posthumously. Ferguson and Krakowski both remember watching from the audience feeling wildly jealous of the participants, so being asked to join the show for its London debut was a dream. “And on top of that,” says Ferguson, “it’s at the National Theatre, which is something everyone dreams of doing, certainly as an American. I feel very, very fancy.”‘A loving farewell’... Chumisa Dornford-May in Here We Are. Photograph: Marc BrennerA satirical amalgam of two of Luis Buñuel’s surrealist films, The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie and The Exterminating Angel, the show is about a group of wealthy friends who head out for brunch, only to find themselves caught up in a sequence of absurd situations. “I’ve sort of taken my lead from Buñuel, who said the only explanation is there’s no explanation,” says Mantello. When it starts to snow in the middle of the room, you don’t ask why: “It’s magical.”The characters are symbols of late-capitalist excess – an immoral industrialist, a philandering ambassador, a celebrity plastic surgeon – but their bond of friendship is real. “The secret is, you cast really charming actors,” says Mantello. “You have such affection for these faces when they walk on stage, and maybe just as you start to run out of patience, so does the show.”The music famously runs out before the end, early in the second half. “Sondheim makes people crazy in all kinds of interesting and different ways,” says Ives. “And social media went crazy over whether this show should even go on. Should Mozart’s Requiem not be heard because Süssmayr had to finish some of the writing? Should Lulu by Alban Berg, one of the greatest operas ever written, not go on because Berg died without finishing the third act? I don’t think so.”It needed Mantello’s vision to stage such a technically tricky show, says Ives. “He is a genius at composition. It’s like watching a classical painting, the way they move around.” The last time he felt so fraught before an opening night, he adds, was when he wrote Venus in Fur, and that was based on a pornographic, sadomasochistic novel. “Joe and I just did not know what people were going to make of this,” he says.Instead of opening on Broadway, they mounted the production at The Shed, a 1,200-seater cultural centre in Hudson Yards. “We tried to find a space to fit the oddness of this piece.” The New York Times, which had questioned the play’s readiness to be seen, pivoted after opening night: “cool and impossibly chic”, it was “a worthy and loving farewell”.“People realised that we weren’t there to somehow traduce a Bible or slander Sondheim,” says Ives. “We were there to show people what he had done. And behold, it was good!”‘You never had to ask him a follow-up question’ … Stephen Sondheim in 1997. Photograph: Douglas Elbinger/Getty ImagesKrakowski’s long musical theatre CV includes a first meeting with “Mr Sondheim” when she was 14, playing Fredericka in a production of A Little Night Music. She still remembers the precision of his notes: “You never had to ask him a follow-up question.” Krakowski’s family adored musical theatre – her mother was a drama teacher, her father gave them Sondheim librettos to study on car trips. At 24, she was performing in the first Broadway revival of Company, terrified by the responsibility of holding the alto line. “And now,” jokes 56-year-old Krakowski, “aged 29 …”Ferguson grew up in New Mexico watching the Tony awards and wearing out hard-to-find videotapes of Sweeney Todd and Into the Woods. He remembers missing out on the part of Jack in Into the Woods at the Albuquerque Civic Light Opera, “and bawling, crying so hard because I really was right for the role. I still am.” Krakowski shakes her head: “Let it go, Jesse.”The only time Ferguson met Sondheim was backstage after a production of Merrily We Roll Alongn Foster. “At this point in my career I had met some very, very famous people, but nothing compared to this man who meant so much to me from such an early age.” Intimidated and overwhelmed, all he could say was: “Good job.” He looks at us with a hangdog expression. “Those are the only two words I ever spoke to Stephen Sondheim.”The composer’s loss still felt fresh during the New York production. “I found that very, very moving, that we actually hear the music stop,” says Krakowski, tearing up at the memory. “And David Hyde Pierce did this very subtle thing,” adds Mantello,” where he just looked up for a second, and it was like bringing him into the room. You don’t want it to get sentimental or maudlin or self-conscious, but it was just a breath to say, ‘You were here.’”‘Cool and impossibly chic’ … the production at the Shed in New York. Photograph: no creditMantello’s inventive staging – including restaurant sets that drop from the ceiling – is being faithfully recreated for the Lyttelton at the NT. The cast, meanwhile, are finding new gags. We watch as Plimpton adds a hint of dominatrix to one character – “That’s something she brought to the table,” says Mantello. And this time around, the show’s end-of-the-world undertones may hit even harder.“Politically, we’re in a very different place,” says Ferguson, “where a lot of those fears – not for everyone, but for many people – are here. Some of it is going to make jokes funnier, and some of it is going to make stuff more poignant. There are lines that I cannot believe have been in this script for three years.” One line about Teslas has taken on an entirely new meaning.We discuss Thomas Ostermeier’s recent production of The Seagull, which questioned the value of theatre and literature when you’re faced with apocalypse. “Being a closeted gay kid in Albuquerque, I went to art to heal me and fill me with purpose,” says Ferguson. “Now I’m a father with two kids, and I’m looking at the world that’s being created around them. And what I do to feel like I can protect them is take them to experience art. So if you ask me what are we even doing here – I’m surviving. You know, this is exactly where I should be right now.”Mantello says one of the reasons he’s excited to bring the show to the UK is that he feels British audiences are more inclined to dissect shows in the aftermath. “I’m making a broad generalisation here, but the idea of the play as the beginning of a conversation – that you take it into the bar next door, that you take what you’ve just experienced and sift through it – happens less in America than you’d think.”How long will it take for this play to become part of the Sondheim canon? “Well, it’s in the canon now,” Ives points out. “And you know, how many of his shows were actually well received? All those we think of as classics lasted a week or two. He loved to say to me, ‘It never made any money.’ And as Mantello says, it takes time for people to catch up to him. But we’re just so proud of it, so, here we are.”', 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Sondheim's final musical 'Here We Are' debuts\\nENTITIES: Stephen Sondheim, Joe Mantello, David Ives, Jane Krakowski, Martha Plimpton, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, National Theatre, Luis Buñuel\\nEVENT: The article discusses the production of Stephen Sondheim's final musical, Here We Are, at the National Theatre in London, highlighting the challenges and emotional resonance of completing the work after his death.\\nCONTEXT: Sondheim's final musical, completed posthumously, debuts in London.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 52900, 'sourceId': 12706, 'url': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-14687977/Ruben-Amorim-breaks-silence-Bruno-Fernandes-mega-money-offer-Saudi-Arabia-Al-Hilal-attempt-lure-Man-United-transfer.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490', 'title': \"Ruben Amorim breaks silence on Bruno Fernandes' mega-money offer from Saudi Arabia - as Al Hilal...\", 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T23:11:44.000Z', 'content': \"Ruben Amorim breaks silence on Bruno Fernandes' mega-money offer from Saudi Arabia - as Al Hilal attempt to lure Man United captain in British transfer record deal\\n15:48, 07 May 2025, updated\\n00:11, 08 May 2025\\nBy\\nCHRIS WHEELER\\nAl-Hilal are prepared to break the British transfer record to buy FernandesThe Saudi Pro League side could pay Fernandes around £200m over three years\\xa0LISTEN NOW: It's All Kicking Off!

He is a leader, he’s the captain, so he’s really important. It’s normal that a lot of clubs want a player like Bruno, like (Alejandro) Garnacho, like others. But we want to keep the best players, and Bruno is clearly one of the top players in the world, so our idea didn’t change.

We know this season was really disappointing for everybody. I felt that and still feel this season was the worst, I don’t say in history but in the last 50 years, I don’t know.’Amorim was also asked about Arsene Wenger’s claims over weekend that the Europa League winners should return to the competition the following season rather than gain automatic qualification for the Champions League. He added: ‘I just know the rules. If people want to change the rules by all means, but these are the rules. If you win the Europa League, you go to the Champions League.‘I know the Champions League should be for teams who are champions, or the best team in the league, but they find this way of promoting the (Europa League) competition.

Another suggests building symbolic pathways and a pair of bridges over the lake in the park.The winning entry will be chosen later this year, but there is no date yet set for when the finished memorial will be unveiled. The construction budget will be between £23m and £46m, depending on the selected design, says the Cabinet Office.TSS JFAAn oak tree from Windsor Great Park was the inspiration for this proposalThe public will get a chance to say whether they want a more traditional representation of the late Queen, or something more experimental, in what will become an important London landmark.The new memorial will be placed not too far from statues of the late Queen\\'s parents, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother. Also nearby is the memorial to Queen Victoria outside Buckingham Palace.WILKINSON EYREInterweaving bridges are used in one of the proposed designsThe location for the monument will be a section of St James\\'s Park close to the Mall and across to a bridge over a lake in the park. The entries include plans to landscape and redesign this area and the construction process is expected to mean replacing the current bridge.The memorial scheme will also provide community projects and facilities around the country. This will follow in the tradition of legacy schemes such as the King George V Playing Fields, which saw almost 500 sports grounds opened in memory of the monarch who died in 1936. Many of those playing fields are still in use, dotted around the country.JLL GibbonsA figure of the late Queen on horseback is part of this design for the parkThe public is being encouraged to contribute ideas about the memorial and to give feedback on the shortlisted designs.\"We want public engagement, we want the public to comment on these proposals, because we want them to feel part of it,\" said Baroness Amos, a member of the committee which will select the design to be built.\"So much of what the late Queen was about was meeting people and engaging with them,\" she said.Baroness Amos, a former leader of the House of Lords, said the memorial should be a fitting tribute to the late Queen, who died at the age of 96 after seven decades on the throne.\"This is about an extraordinary woman and an extraordinary reign, about her commitment to public service, her duty, her commitment to the community, to the nation and the Commonwealth,\" she said.The five final teams are: Foster + Partners with Yinka Shonibare and Michel Desvigne PaysagisteHeatherwick Studio with Halima Cassell, MRG Studio, Webb Yates and ArupJ&L Gibbons with Michael Levine RDI, William Matthews Associates, Structure Workshop and ArupTom Stuart-Smith with Jamie Fobert Architects, Adam Lowe (Factum Arte) and Structure WorkshopWilkinsonEyre with Lisa Vandy and Fiona Clark, Andy Sturgeon Design, Atelier One and Hilson Moran', 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Queen Elizabeth Memorial Designs Unveiled for Public Input\\nENTITIES: Queen Elizabeth II, Foster + Partners, Heatherwick Studio, J&L Gibbons, Tom Stuart-Smith, WilkinsonEyre, Baroness Amos\\nEVENT: Final designs revealed for Queen Elizabeth II memorial to be built in St James's Park, London.

It offers excellent battery life and more than enough power for daily tasks at an affordable price. On the other side, the MacBook Pro offers three levels of power to meet the needs of even the most demanding user, more RAM, more storage, longer battery life and a significantly superior display. Those features aren’t cheap though.\\nThere is so much mode to differentiate the different Apple laptop models as you will see if you read on.\\nFor advice about the best MacBook, we also have a buying guide, see: Best MacBook: Which Mac laptop is best?

When Apple introduced the M4 version of the MacBook Air in March 2025 it dropped the price by $100/£100. As a result, the price gap is even larger between the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air.\\nWith no ‘budget’ MacBook Pro available, the MacBook Air is the only option for those looking for a bargain. If you are looking for the cheapest option the $999/£999 MacBook Air would appear to be the clear winner. However, we recommend spending $200/£200 more to get the 10-core CPU/10-core GPU 512GB MacBook Air, which is worth every extra penny.\\nThe price of the MacBook Pro is higher, and on everyday tasks it performs the same as the MacBook Air, but it does offer better performance on long, CPU-intensive tasks, like image and video rendering and similar tasks. Not to mention the better screen, HDMI port, and SDXC Card slot, and more discussed below.

However, to the average person the screen quality of the MacBook Air will be more than sufficient.\\nIt’s not just fewer pixels though. Both Airs have a maximum brightness of 500 nits, which is half of the Pro’s 1,000 nits in normal use, or a third if you’re running HDR content at a max of 1,600 nits of which the MacBook Pro is capable. This is achieved by the Pro display incorporating mini-LEDs rather than the Air’s standard LCD screen.\\nPerhaps the biggest difference though is that the Pro features ProMotion, meaning that the refresh rate tops out at 120Hz, again double that of the Air’s 60Hz refresh rate. This helps keep scrolling and animations smooth and crisp. Any of these displays will be great for everyday use and long hours of work, but the Pro has the edge when it comes to features.\\nAnd there is more. With the M4 MacBook Pro, Apple introduced a nano-texture glass option that has a matte-like finish for $150.\\xa0This option is not available on the MacBook Air, and if you need to cut down the glare from the display, it’s a feature to consider.\\nAll of this is mute if you will plug your Mac into a display, of course, in which case you can buy a display that offers you the screen quality you need.\\n15-inch MacBook Air (left) and 14-inch MacBook Pro.Foundry\\nMacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: Performance Difference\\nThere’s a reason why there is a “Pro” in the name. The MacBook Pro is better suited to pro users, by which we mean creative professionals, graphic designers, photographers, film makers, 3D animators, programmers, and so on. A MacBook Air would be more than sufficient for home users, students, and office workers, but as soon as you start to push it with something more demanding, like movie editing software, or a computer game, you might find it heats up and slows down a bit, at least in comparison to how a MacBook Pro would deal with the dame demands. That’s why we tend to recommend the MacBook Air to those who go beyond the typical user.\\nDespite this, if you are upgrading an old computer, the MacBook Air will feel super speedy whatever you are doing with it.\\nWe have the data below to show just how much better MacBook Pro performance is compared to the MacBook Air.\\nMacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: Processor\\nAll of Apple’s laptops are powered by Apple’s silicon and right now the latest Apple chip is the M4, which comes in the following varieties: M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max. To learn more about all the Mac processors read our Mac processor comparison.\\nWhen it comes to the processor specs the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air actually look pretty well matched, as shown by this table.\\nMacBookPriceCPUGPUMemorySSD13.6-inch MacBook Air, M4 (2025)\\xa0$999/£99910-core, M48-core, M416GB (up to 32GB)256GB SSD13.6-inch MacBook Air, M4 (2025)\\xa0$1,199/£1,19910-core, M410-core, M416GB (up to 32GB)512GB SSD13.6-inch MacBook Air, M4 (2025)\\xa0$1,399/£1,39910-core, M410-core, M424GB (up to 32GB)512GB SSD15-inch MacBook Air, M4 (2025)$1,199/£1,19910-core, M410-core, M416GB (up to 32GB)256GB SSD15-inch MacBook Air, M4(2025)$1,399/£1,39910-core, M410-core, M416GB (up to 32GB)512GB SSD15-inch MacBook Air, M4 (2025)$1,599/£1,59910-core, M410-core, M424GB (up to 32GB)512GB SSD14-inch MacBook Pro, M4 (2024)$1,599/£1,59910-core, M410-core, M416GB (up to 32GB)512GB SSD14-inch MacBook Pro, M4 (2024)$1,799/£1,79910-core, M410-core, M416GB (up to 32GB)1TB SSD14-inch MacBook Pro, M4 (2024)$1,999/£1,99910-core, M410-core, M424GB (up to 32GB)1TB SSDThe specs look similar, but there are factors in the design of the MacBook Pro that will enable the machine to withstand higher power requirements.\\nHowever, there is a difference in terms of how well the processors perform in the different models, as you can see from the Geekbench and Cinebench results below. A similarly specced MacBook Pro performs better than the MacBook Air, albeit only slightly beter.\\nThe M4 15-inch MacBook Air scored 14680 in the multiple CPU Geekbench and 3907 in the GPU test for Cinebench 2024.\\nThe M4 14-inch MacBook Pro scored 14763 in the multiple CPU Geekbench and 3997 in the GPU test for Cinebench 2024.\\nThe M4 Pro 16-inch MacBook Pro scored 22406 in the multiple CPU Geekbench and 9297 in the GPU test for Cinebench 2024.\\nThe chart below shows the Geekbench results for the various processors.\\nThe MacBook Air is slower because in order for it to be so compact it is fanless, which means it is less able to manage heat, and therefore may run slower in order to keep cool if you really push it. If it’s power you need then, as the benchmarks show, a MacBook Pro will have the edge.\\nHowever, that’s not to say that the M4 MacBook Air is slow. As you can see from the scores above, the M4 shoots ahead of the M3, M2 and M1, in fact it even scores above the M3 Pro. The M4 MacBook Air is plenty powerful enough for most people, and likely way better than any old Mac you are replacing.\\nIf you really need a powerful machine you might want to consider the M4 Pro MacBook Pro.\\nIf you need to push your Mac with graphic-intensive apps a MacBook Pro would be a better choice.Foundry\\nMacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: RAM (unified memory)\\nPrior to October 2024, many Macs shipped with just 8GB RAM as standard. These days a Mac may struggle with just 8GB RAM so Apple has upped this allocation, and since October 2024 all MacBook Air and MacBook Pro ship with at least 16GB RAM as standard. There is an option to increase unified memory to 24GB or 32GB in the M4 MacBook Pro and Air.\\nIf you need more memory you will need to look to the MacBook Pro with M4 Pro or M4 Max. With the M4 Pro you can get up to 48GB unified memory, while the M4 Max can support up to 128GB memory.\\nOur advice is to get as much RAM as you can afford when you buy the Mac, as you can’t upgrade it later.\\nMacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: Storage\\nApple offers a 256GB storage option at the entry-level for both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air. The entry-level MacBook Pro starts at 512GB. There is the option to add 1TB or 2TB SSD to both laptops.\\nWhile a 2556GB SSD might prove to be enough for you, especially if you use iCloud or other cloud based services to supplement your storage. But 512GB might be a better option, as we found, see: Here’s proof that a 256GB SSD is too small for a Mac in 2025.\\nAnother reason to avoid the 256GB model: in previous generations, there were some concerns about this 256GB SSD, with reports that its SSD is up to 50 percent slower on read speeds and 30 percent on write speeds. We found that these observations were indeed true when we ran our own set of tests using Blackmagic Disk Speed Test on older MacBook models. In more recent times, this has seemed to be less of an issue. This will only matter if you are using apps that access the SSD often, so it may not make a difference in typical use.\\nIf you want more than 2TB SSD you need to look at the MacBook Pro models with the M4 Pro and M4 Max which can support up to 8TB SSD.\\nMacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: Design\\n15-inch MacBook Air (left) and 14-inch MacBook Pro (right).Foundry\\nFollowing a redesign of the MacBook Air in June 2022, you could have been forgiven for thinking you were looking at a MacBook Pro. Gone is the tapered edge for which the Air was famous, replaced with a more uniform design. The MacBook Air is still thinner – albeit fractionally – but it is also very slightly larger than the old version of the Air, thanks to the bigger screen.\\nBoth the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro have a notch at the top of the screen as see on some iPhone models. It’s not a bad thing, but some people don’t like notches. The notch conceals the FaceTime camera, which, with the introduction of the M4 MacBook Air, is now the same 12MP Center Stage camera with support for Desk View and 1080p HD video recording on all models.\\nDespite the presence of the iPhone-like notch, MacBooks do not offer Face ID for unlocking. Instead all MacBook’s have a Touch ID sensor built into the keyboard, so you can just tap your finger on there to unlock things and enter passwords.\\nEugen Wegmann\\nOne key difference between these MacBooks is the color choices. There are four color choices for the 13-inch MacBook Air and the 15-inch MacBook Air: Midnight (dark blue), Starlight (gold), Sky Blue and Silver. Apple introduced the Sky Blue option with the M4 MacBook Air and discontinued the Space Gray option (to the dismay of some). The Starlight shade is paler gold, while Midnight is close to black with a dark blue hue.\\nThe 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro offer only Silver and Space Black options.\\nMacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: Dimensions\\nFoundry\\nApple refers to them as the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air and the 14-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro. The measurements are based on the screen size, but those numbers are actually not accurate. Here’s what the real screen measurements are:\\nThe screen on the 13-inch MacBook Air measures 13.6-inches diagonally.\\nThe screen on the 15-inch MacBook Air measures 15.3-inches diagonally.\\nThe screen on the 14-inch MacBook Pro measures 14.2-inches diagonally.\\nThe screen on the 16-inch MacBook Pro measures 16.2-inches diagonally.\\nA larger display doesn’t necessarily mean the Mac is bigger and heavier though. The 15-inch Air is thinner, so it not only weighs less than the 16-inch MacBook Pro, it is also lighter than the 14-inch MacBook Pro due to the fans needed for heat dissipation in the more powerful machine.\\n16-inch MacBook Pro, M4 Pro: 4.7 pounds (2.14 kg), M4 Max: 4.7 pounds (2.15 kg)\\n14-inch MacBook Pro, M4 Pro: 3.5 pounds (1.60 kg), M4 Max: 3.6 pounds (1.62 kg)\\n14-inch MacBook Pro, M4: 3.4 pounds (1.55 kg)\\n15-inch MacBook Air, M4: 3.3 pounds (1.51 kg)\\n13-inch MacBook Air, M4: 2.7 pounds (1.24 kg)\\nFrom the figures above, you’ll notice that the M4 Pro and M4 Max models weigh a little bit more than the M4 MacBook Pro.\\nAnd as you can see from the below, the 13-inch MacBook Air dimensions aren’t much smaller than those of the 14-inch MacBook Air. Given that there is actually only half an inch (0.6in) difference in screen size, this shouldn’t be surprising.\\n16-inch MacBook Pro, M4: 14.01 x 9.77 x 0.66 inches (35.57 x 24.81 x 1.68cm)\\n15-inch MacBook Air, M4: 13.40 x 9.35 x 0.45 inches (34.04 x 23.76 x 1.15cm)\\n14-inch MacBook Pro, M4: 12.31 x 8.71 x 0.61 inches (31.26 x 22.12 x 1.55cm)\\n13-inch MacBook Air, M4: 11.97 x 8.46 x 0.44 inches (30.41 x 21.5 x 1.13cm)\\nThe MacBook Air (bottom) is thinner than the MacBook Pro (top).Apple\\nMacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: Battery life and charging\\nThe MacBook Air ships with a braided MagSafe cable and compact dual-USB-C Power Adapter.IDG\\nWhen it comes to battery life, according to Apple, the MacBook Air offers 18 hours battery life when video streaming, while the 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro offers an 24 hours video streaming. The main reason for this difference is that the 14-inch MacBook Pro has a larger battery: 72.4 watt-hours compared to 66.5 watt-hours in the 15-inch MacBook Air and 53.8 watt-hours in the 13-inch Air. The battery in the 16-inch MacBook Pro is even bigger at 100 watt-hours.\\nMacBook Air, 13-inch, M4, 18 hours battery life (Apple)\\nMacBook Air, 15-inch, M4, 18 hours battery life (Apple), 1,076 minutes, just under 18 hours (our test)\\nMacBook Pro, 14-inch, M4, 24 hours battery life (Apple), 20 hours (our test)\\nMacBook Pro, 14-inch, M4 Pro/M4 Max, 22 hours battery life (Apple)\\nMacBook Pro, 16-inch, M4 Pro/M4 Max, 24 hours battery life (Apple), 26 hours (our test)\\nIt’s not just how long the battery lasts that matters, but also the charging speed. The entry-level 13-inch MacBook Air ships with a 30W adapter, the other 13-inch Air and the 15-inch MacBook Air ship with a 35W power adapter. The 14-inch MacBook Pro M4, and the entry-level M4 Pro ships with a 70W adapter, the other 14-inch MAcBook Pro models offer a 96W charger, and the 16-inch model has a 140W adapter for even faster charging.\\nEach 14-inch MacBook Pro can also be fast charged with a 96W adapter (only included with some models) and the MacBook Air can be fast charged with a 70W adapter (not included). See our comparison test of Apple’s MacBook Air chargers as well as the best USB-C charger for your MacBook.\\nMacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: Ports and expansion\\nOver the years it’s felt like Apple has been on a mission to remove ports from Macs in order to make them slimmer and slimmer. This has been a disadvantage for many, although generally if you need more or different ports you can just plug in an adapter or a dock (read: Best USB-C hubs and adapters for Mac).\\nThe MacBook Air offers a MagSafe charging port alongside two Thunderbolt 4/USB-C ports.\\nThe MacBook Pro offers an additional Thunderbolt 4/USB-C port, as well as HDMI and SDXC ports.\\nThe arrival of Thunderbolt 4 for this generation means that the M4 MacBooks can support more displays. See: How to connect two or more external displays to an M1, M2, M3 or M4 MacBook.\\nConnectivity for both models is via Bluetooth 5.3 and Wi-Fi 6E. All Mac laptops offer a 3.5mm headphone jack.\\nThe MacBook Air with MagSafe as well as two USB/Thunderbolt ports compared to the 2020 M1 MacBook Air.IDG\\nMacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: Audio and camera\\nAll of the MacBooks in the current generation offer a 12MP Center Stage camera that automatically keeps the user in the center of the frame. The camera also supports Desk View, which can show the desk space in front of the laptop. This is an upgrade from the M3 MacBooks, which only offered a 1080p FaceTime camera.\\nThe 15-inch MacBook Air has a benefit over the 13-inch MacBook Air model: if features a six-speaker sound system with force-canceling woofers, compared to a four-speaker sound system. Apple describes the speaker system in the 14-inch MacBook Pro as a high-fidelity six-speaker sound system with force-cancelling woofers, indicating that it is superior to that in the 15-inch Air. Apple also refers to a “studio-quality three-mic array with high signal-to-noise ratio and directional beamforming” in the 14-inch Pro, while both Air models offer only a “three-mic array with directional beamforming”.\\nThe MacBook Pro has a better speaker system than the MacBook Air: six-speaker arrays rather than a four-speaker sound system. The sound on the MacBook Pro is described by Apple as “High Fidelity,” by which we assume Apple is indicating it is superior to the Air.\\nMacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: Buying advice\\nSo which MacBook should you choose? If you are on a budget it has to be the MacBook Air and you won’t be disappointed. If you need a bit more power than the Air can offer, and a better quality display, the M4 MacBook Pro will see you good. But if you need even more power you’ll have to fork out for the M4 Pro or M4 Max MacBook Pro models.\\nIf one factor that is important to you is the screen size, the 15-inch MacBook Air will give you a larger screen for less money than the 14-inch MacBook Pro. Just be aware that screen quality is not as good as that on the more expensive model. Of course, if you are going to plug your Mac into an external display whenever you are at your desk this shouldn’t be a decision breaker. See our round-up of the best displays for Mac.\\nIf it’s display quality that matters, the XDR, ProMotion display of the MacBook Pro will meet your needs. There is also the option of a non-glossy Nano-texture display with the MacBook Pro that doesn’t exist for the Air.\\nWe recommend getting the best machine you can afford at the time of purchase because you won’t be able to upgrade down the line.

It reportedly contained photos of girls Among the materials reportedly found was a hard drive containing photographs believed to be taken in Portugal, thought to be crucial in persuading investigators that Madeleine died shortly after her disappearance in May 2007.A laptop was also handed to police, the Sun reported, thought to contain vital information linking Brueckner to the case.Police are also said to have discovered a stash of USB sticks and memory cards buried beneath the body of Brueckner\\'s dead dog, which was buried at the disused factory.The storage devices are alleged to have contained thousands of files, including images of child abuse, stories detailing fantasies of abducting young girls, and records of Skype chats with other paedophiles.\\xa0One story reported by The Sun described drugging a mother and daughter outside a pre-school and abusing a four-year-old blonde girl.\\xa0These materials are believed to be among the cache that led investigators to believe that Brueckner was involved in Madeleine\\'s disappearance and death.Further searches of the compound are reported to have revealed over 75 children\\'s swimming costumes, toys, small bikes, and masks.\\xa0Three unlicensed firearms and ammunition were also said to have been found, along with bottles of substances suspected to be chloroform or ether - chemicals that can cause unconsciousness.The Sun also reported that a satellite navigation device seized by police traced Brueckner\\'s movements in the Algarve, including the Arade Dam, approximately 35 miles from where Madeleine vanished in Praia da Luz.Pictures of Brueckner posing at the dam were also reportedly found - including a bizarre nude selfie in which he had crudely drawn a balaclava-esque mask over his face.\\xa0 Bottles and substances found inside a Jaguar matching the description of Brueckner\\'s vehicle Among the items found in the bolthole in Neuwegersleben were 75 child\\'s swimming costumes This laptop was reported to have been handed to German police and allegedly contains information that could link Brueckner to Madeleine\\'s disappearance Police recovered three black-market guns and ammunition - alongside bottles of substances suspected to be chloroform or ether, both of which can cause unconsciousness An insurance document reportedly proves for the first time Brueckner was at a festival in March 2008 where he allegedly all but confessed to killing Madeleine Police later searched areas around the Arade Dam in 2023, removing materials later sent to German authorities. Two members of the Metropolitan Police also attended the search, according to a Freedom of Information response.\\xa0It is unclear whether any of the material found in Portugal two years ago has ultimately yielded fresh evidence of Brueckner\\'s alleged involvement in her disappearance.However, an insurance claim signed by Brueckner, among the cache reported by the Sun, indicates he was at a festival in Orgiva, Spain, in early 2008, where he allegedly told a friend that Madeleine \\'did not scream\\'.The insurance document suggests he crashed his Winnebago at a petrol station in the town on March 20 that year. The festival ran from March 21 to 23, according to archive listings.That claim originated in a letter written by Brueckner wrote from prison after being convicted of rape, revealed by the Mail in 2023, in which he attacked the account of a key informant, Helge Busching.Busching had told German authorities in 2017 that Brueckner had \\'made a comment about the missing girl\\' at a \\'hippy festival\\' in Spain in 2008 - and later relayed the claims to national tabloid Bild.He had said: \\'Christian asked me if I was still going to Portugal.\\'I replied: \"I\\'m no longer going to Portugal because there are too many problems there, Portugal has too many police for me on account of the missing child.\\'\"It is indeed strange that she disappeared without a trace.\"\\xa0\\'Christian replied: \"Yes, she did not scream.\"\\'Brueckner has described the account as \\'not even worthy of comment\\' and has denied any involvement in Madeleine McCann\\'s disappearance. Questions also remain over Busching\\'s account. A photograph thought to show Christian\\xa0Brueckner at the Arade Dam - a key location in the Madeleine McCann investigation which Portuguese police searched in 2023 German police unearthed the disturbing cache of materials at a former box-making factory owned by Bruecker (pictured in 2020) Plastic boxes, electronics and a bathtub dumped outside Brueckner\\'s run-down bolthole Police are seen searching areas around the Arade Dam in Portugal in May 2023 A police tent in the Arade Dam area. Materials were sent to German authorities for further analysis but it is not known if any decisive evidence was found Brueckner is likely to walk free from prison later this year unless prosecutors are able to conclusively charge him German prosecutors have stated for years that they believe Brueckner is responsible for the youngster\\'s death.They have previously disclosed that mobile phone location data puts Brueckner in Praia da Luz on the night Madeleine disappeared.\\xa0In 2020,\\xa0German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters told Australian news programme 60 Minutes, which said 8,000 pieces of evidence had been found at the factory: \\'We have strong evidence that Madeleine McCann is dead and that our suspect killed her.\\'We don\\'t have the body and no parts of the body, but we have enough evidence to say our suspect killed Madeleine McCann.\\'He added at the time that he had written to Madeleine\\'s parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, stating as much.\\'The parents have been told the German police have evidence that she is dead but we have not told them the details,\\' he said.Despite these findings, German prosecutors have yet to charge Brueckner in connection with Madeleine\\'s disappearance.\\xa0Brueckner is currently serving seven years for raping an elderly American woman in the Algarve the year before Madeleine disappeared and he is due to be released later this year.Prosecutors are seeking a retrial over separate rape claims for which he was acquitted late last year.\\xa0If that fails, they will then seek an appeal, but Brueckner\\'s lawyers have told MailOnline it \\'only has a ten per cent chance of succeeding\\'.Just last month MailOnline revealed that the budget for detectives investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann had been slashed.They have been granted a further £108,000 to carry on the search for her - a drop of £84,000 on the amount awarded last year.The money was approved in April following a request from the Metropolitan Police\\'s Operation Grange team who were specifically tasked with finding the toddler.With the latest £108,000 Operation Grange has spent almost £13.5million investigating the case – prompting some to question whether it is viable considering no arrests or charges have been made.The money comes from a special Home Office fund and is reviewed annually with Operation Grange making a request which is submitted and then considered.Last week marked the 18th anniversary of her disappearance on May 3, and also her 22nd birthday - but there has been no real breakthrough in the hunt. Kate and Gerry McCann, Madeleine\\'s parents, hold pyjamas similar to those of their daughter during a press conference in June 2007 Brueckner is serving seven years for raping an elderly American woman in the Algarve the year before Madeleine disappeared Prosecutors insist Madeleine is dead but are yet to disclose evidence supporting this theory Police standing outside the Ocean Club hotel village on May 4, 2007, a day after Madeleine was reported missing Gerry and Kate McCann hold a picture of Madeleine as they make an appeal from the holiday apartment days after she disappeared In a heart-rending statement, Kate and Gerry McCann restated their unwavering commitment to finding out the truth of what has happened to their daughter.It read: \\'As we arrive at the 18th anniversary of Madeleine\\'s abduction, we\\'d like to thank our faithful supporters once again for standing by us and never forgetting about Madeleine.\\'The years appear to be passing even more quickly and whilst we have no significant news to share, our determination to \"leave no stone unturned\" is unwavering. We will do our utmost to achieve this.\\'May is also the month which includes International Missing Children\\'s Day (25th).\\xa0\\'We continue to remember all missing children and their families, both here in the UK and abroad, thinking especially of all the children displaced from their homes & families in Ukraine and Gaza at this time.\\'We\\'re very grateful to the UK charity Missing People for their ongoing, invaluable work, and to all organisations, charities and police forces who remain committed, despite many challenges and limited resources, to finding & bringing home the many missing and abducted children. \\'May is also Madeleine\\'s birthday - her 22nd this year.

The Hang Seng in Hong Kong gained only 0.1% by the end of trading, closing at 22,691.88. The Shanghai Composite index rose 0.8% to 3,342.67. The trade talks may account for the decision to announce the economic rescue package, Lynne Song of ING Economics said in a report. “This way, the easing won’t be seen as a knee-jerk reaction to tariffs. Policymakers are likely now privy to some of the early data on how the economy is being impacted by the tariff shock,” Song said. But analysts said the muted response to the policies announced Wednesday also may reflect disappointment over the lack of major government spending increases that many economists say may be needed to wrest the Chinese economy out of its doldrums. “These will help to shore up growth at the margin. But any boost to credit demand will be modest and today’s moves are no substitute for an expansion in fiscal support,\" Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a report.

Palantir’s stock’s price remains near $110, when it was sitting at only $20 less than a year ago. Uncertainty around tariffs has made U.S. households more pessimistic about the economy and could affect their long-term plans for purchases. That uncertainty has helped fuel a surge in imports ahead of potentially more severe tariffs ahead. The U.S. trade deficit soared to a record $140.5 billion in March as consumers and businesses alike tried to get ahead of tariffs that went into effect in April and others that have been postponed until July. Last week, the government reported the U.S. economy shrank at a 0.3% annual pace during the first quarter of the year because of a surge in imports.Some companies say they’re already seeing impacts to their business from the uncertainty created by tariffs.DoorDash fell 7.4% after reporting weaker revenue than analysts expected for the latest quarter.Also early Wednesday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.32% from 4.31% late Tuesday.U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 54 cents to $59.63 per barrel.

One of the locals asked 'Why would you go there?' And they told me who it was run by,' he said.\\xa0It turns out the café is run by The Twelve Tribes, which was founded in Tennessee and expanded to Australia in the 1990s.\\xa0Those working in the café live in nearby Balmoral House while the rest are at a farm near Picton, about 90 minutes south-west of Sydney.The cult has been accused of child abuse and child labour as well as forcing its members to live by authoritarian rules. It is not suggested there is any truth to the accusations. Mr Hammond (pictured) said he 'felt guilty' for 'accidentally supporting a cult' The Yellow Deli Cafe is a popular spot on Katoomba's main street (customers pictured) In 2019, Andrew McLeod, who then managed the cafe and is an original member of the Australian branch of the group,\\xa0said allegations of child abuse and child labour were untrue.'We want our children to have a well-balanced life and what we do and our beliefs have somehow been taken out of context to portray us as a fundamentalist cult that bashes our children, which is just not true,' he said.'It's sad that so many people are gullible enough to believe what they believe without looking into it themselves.'Mr Hammond shared a video on TikTok about the encounter, admitting he 'felt guilty' for 'accidentally supporting a cult'.'Went into the Yellow Deli in Katoomba thinking, “Wow, what a wholesome little café — handmade furniture, herbal tea, peaceful vibes…,” he captioned the clip.'Turns out it’s run by The Twelve Tribes, which is less “hippie commune” and more “actual cult with some seriously wild beliefs.”'I was just out here vibing with my sandwich, meanwhile unknowingly funding the end times. Honestly though… great eggs 9/10. Would escape again.'The viral clip was flooded with comments from locals and visitors who had also innocently come across the establishment.\\xa0On reflection, Mr Hammond suggested his tattoos may have caused his less-than-friendly reception, having since heard similar experiences of others who have visited the cafe.\\xa0 The expat said he 'can't complain about the food' but would not return to the cafe as 'it's not something I would support'.The cafe declined to comment when contacted by Daily Mail Australia.What is the Twelves Tribes? The cult began in 1975 in Chattanooga, Tennessee, when former carnival showman Gene Spriggs broke away from the\\xa0First Presbyterian Church after finding services were cancelled for the Super Bowl.He and his wife Marsha earlier opened the first Yellow Deli a few years earlier and were living communally with a small group from 1972.Twelve Tribes practices a hybrid of pre-Catholic Christianity and Judaism mixed with teachings by Spriggs.The group's stated aim is to bring about the return of Jesus - whom they refer to by the Hebrew name Yahshua - by reestablishing the 12 tribes of Israel. Twelve Tribes practices a hybrid of pre-Catholic Christianity and Judaism mixed with teachings by its founder, Gene Spriggs All members are forced to sell their possessions and give to proceeds to the cult and are assigned a Hebrew name discard their old ones. Spriggs himself is known as\\xa0Yoneq.\\xa0These tribes would include 144,000 'perfect male children', which accounts for the group's obsessive and controversial child-rearing practices.The Sabbath is observed in line with Jewish tradition, along with conservative dietary rules and abstinence from alcohol, tobacco, and drugs.Birth control of any kind is banned, as is much modern medicine - they instead rely largely on homeopathy and 'natural' remedies.Marriage outside the cult is forbidden and couples must go through a series of supervised talks to get to know each other. Only after marriage can they even kiss or hold hands. These tribes would include 144,000 'perfect male children', which accounts for the group's obsessive and controversial child-rearing practices Children aren't allowed to play with toys, engage in make-believe, or any of the normal childhood activities, and must be supervised at all times.They must be strictly obedient and are beaten with a 50cm rod for every infraction by any adult watching them, not just their parents.All children are homeschooled and do not attend university as it is considered a waste of time and not a good environment.Instead, children work in the community from a young age, sparking accusations of child labour.Estée Lauder and other businesses cut ties with the organisation after finding children were involved in making their products.\\xa0 The few boxes of pamphlets would be easily missed or glossed over by the vast majority of visitors Members don't vote and are not allowed to watch TV or any other media as 'the crazy box robs your time and pollutes your soul'.\\xa0Twelve Tribes has 3,000 members and operates in the U.S., Canada, France, Spain, Argentina, Brazil, Germany and England, arriving in Australia in the early 1990s.Members live in Balmoral House in Katoomba, Peppercorn Creek Farm near Picton, and a small number in Coledale, north of Wollongong.Numerous businesses include a network of cafes in every country, all called the Yellow Deli or Common Ground, and bakeries, farms, and furniture, construction, and demolition businesses.These are believed to be very profitable because none of the workers need to be paid.\", 'location': 'AUS', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Tourist unknowingly supports cult-run Australian cafe\\nENTITIES: Tom Hammond, The Yellow Deli Cafe, The Twelve Tribes, Australia\\nEVENT: A British tourist unknowingly ate at a cafe run by a controversial religious cult, The Twelve Tribes, in the Blue Mountains, Australia.\\nCONTEXT: Tourist warns others about cult-run cafe in Australia.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 53902, 'sourceId': 12816, 'url': 'https://www.foxsports.com.au/ufc/ufc-2025-robert-whittaker-on-next-ufc-fight-renier-de-ridder-rumours-prediction-for-ufc-315-jack-della-maddalena-vs-belal-muhammad/news-story/db1e27bde7a0033f94bde1b5922454ef', 'title': '‘It’s bulls***’: Aussie’s ducking claims blasted amid UFC title ‘kill shot’ prediction', 'publishDate': '2025-05-08T05:58:00.000Z', 'content': 'Robert Whittaker reckons Australia will crown its third UFC champion via “kill shot” this Sunday - while also opening up on his own chances of headlining Down Under and “bulls***” ducking claims.

Sports.The prediction comes six years after Bobby Knuckles became Australia’s first UFC champion, and with rumours swirling he could be set to fight rising Dutch star Renier de Ridder as soon as International Fight Week in July.While Whittaker stressed late on Wednesday afternoon that no contracts have been signed, the fighter also suggested the UFC may also be saving him for his first Australian appearance in 2019 – when beaten by Israel Adesanya for the middleweight crown.Elsewhere, Whittaker also confirmed that he has either requested, or accepted, UFC fight offers against a host of potential rivals in recent weeks – among them Sean Strickland, Caio Borralho and Roman Dolidze.Over the past 24 hours, there have also been reports suggesting the former champ is being offered breakout Dutch prospect de Ridder, who is himself fresh off a huge win over American phenom Bo Nickal.When it comes to who the Sydneysider faces next, Whittaker’s agent Titus Day also hit back at recent claims from Borralho that the Australian was ducking him, branding the suggestion “bulls***”.Whittaker relives UFC championship win | 02:42Yet more immediately, our first UFC champ wanted to chat about the Perth native who could be next.With Whittaker convinced JDM can become the nation’s latest belt holder, and only weeks after Alexander Volkanovski reclaimed his UFC featherweight crown.While Maddalena is as wide as $3 with some bookmakers, Whittaker insists the former schoolboy rugby star will shock in Sunday’s championship bout.Asked how JDM wins, the former champ started: “It’s tricky because Belal, he’s really good at turning bouts into dog fights.“That’s where he thrives.“And so to win, Jack must embrace that.“Then, mate, he just needs to bide his time.“As we saw in his last fight against Gilbert Burns, Jack is so good at finding those moments that change big fights … then finding the kill shot.“And I feel like if he bides his time, stays patient, embraces the dogfight, he’s then got 25 minutes to find that moment to take the belt.”While Muhammad is tipped to try and win the fight grappling, Whittaker surprisingly suggested the champ would “likely have more success standing”.“Because wrestling takes it out of you,” he explained. “And Jack is no chump on the ground.“So apart from there being danger when Belal tries to take Jack down, it’ll also wear him out.“And again, as we saw in the Burns fight, Jack fought through adversity and then still had kill shot potential at the very end of round three.“So it may be safer for Belal to stand and bang.”\"I\\'m going to do your boy dirty!\" | 04:49And as for JDM keeping that “kill shot” potential through five rounds of a title fight?“Definitely, he can,” Whittaker insisted.“Before that Gilbert Burns fight, I would’ve had a different outlook.“But that fight really opened my eyes.“While I always knew how good Jack was, it was that performance where he really displayed a certain X-factor.”Currently sitting at No.5 in the UFC middleweight rankings, Whittaker is himself coming off a nasty first-round loss to Khamzat Chimaev at UFC 308 – with the Aussie tapping to a face crank that seriously damaged his teeth and jaw.Seven months on and Whittaker still doesn’t know who he will fight next, or where.Overnight, there were reports linking ‘The Reaper’ to de Ridder as soon as UFC 317 in late June.Other whispers include a Perth Fight Night card in July, or suggestions Dana White could bring a Pay-Per-View card Down Under at the back end of this year to be headlined by Maddalena’s first title defence should he win.For Whittaker, an Australian bout would represent his first on homesoil since losing UFC middleweight gold to Adesanya in 2019.Since then, one of Australia’s most popular athletes has fought four times in America, three in Abu Dhabi, plus one each in Paris and Saudi Arabia.“And I’ve heard rumours of an Australian card in Perth (this July),” he said.“So maybe they’re holding me out for that.“We’ll have to wait and see.“Certainly, I’d love to fight here again.”\\'Jack can win at any moment!\\' | 02:27But as for an opponent?“Initially, I was asking for Strickland because I thought the fight made sense,” said the fighter“Especially with our respective timelines.“But I know the UFC have a few moving pieces right now and, while they haven’t locked me in for anything, they’ve still come to me with a few names.“(Laughs) It’s basically been everyone and their friend who didn’t have a fight locked in.“And I’ve said yes for all of them.“My goal is to win that belt back.“To make my way back up there and get that title shot again.”Whittaker’s agent Day also shot down suggestions from rising Brazilian star Borralho that the former champ was ducking him.“Because we actually approached the UFC about fighting Caio,” Day stressed.“But we got nothing back.“It was the same when we first asked about Strickland.“Then we were approached by the UFC about Dolidze and said ‘yes’, but there has been nothing regarding Borralho … the idea we’re ducking him is bulls***”.” While Team Whittaker were unavailable for comment on Thursday regarding de Ridder, it is understood that no deal has yet been struck for who the former champ fights next – or where.Asked if he was frustrated by the delay, Whittaker continued: “Yeah, it’s frustrating to be on the sidelines but I realise things and tricky.“And this is the nature of the beast, right?“And not the first time it’s happened, either.“But I never really complain or ask for too much when it comes to who I fight.“I just like to control the date.“I feel that’s my tradeoff.“And for me, getting things finalised is important.“To get into the gear I need to, I like a name and a date.”',

GlobalP/Getty ImagesScientists have made a potent antivenom using antibodies from a man who has been bitten hundreds of times by venomous snakes. The therapy protects mice against the venoms of 19 species of deadly snake, including the king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah).The antivenom combines the existing drug varespladib with antibodies that are copies of those in the blood of Tim Friede, a US snake collector who has given himself more than 600 doses of venom to build up his immunity. He has also been bitten roughly 200 times by venomous snakes. The antivenom is reported today in a paper in Cell.Scientists say that the research could lead to direly needed treatments, but that its reliance on material from a person who performed dangerous experiments on himself makes it ethically murky. The paper’s authors say they played no part in Friede’s self-exposure to venom. “We did not advise Friede to do this and no one else needs to do this again — we have all the molecules we need,” says co-author Jacob Glanville, chief executive of biomedical firm Centivax in South San Francisco, California. “Snake venom is dangerous,” he adds, and he cautions people not to follow Friede’s example.On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

Each antivenom protects against the venom of at most a few species.“Considering the advanced technologies available in immunology today, it is unacceptable to continue relying on these outdated methods for treating snake bites,” says Kartik Sunagar, a biologist who develops antivenoms at the Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru.The paper’s authors sought to make an antivenom that would protect against a wide range of the world’s 600-plus venomous snake species. As a start, the team focused on the Elapidae family, which includes nearly half of those species. Elapid venom contains peptides called short-chain neurotoxins (SNX) and long-chain neurotoxins (LNX). Both types of peptide bind to the same receptors on nerve cells, impairing communication between neurons and potentially causing muscle paralysis and respiratory failure.Don’t try this at homeGlanville and his co-author Peter Kwong, a biochemist at Columbia University in New York City, had read news coverage about Friede, who took careful notes about his venom exposure. After receiving approval from an ethics review board, getting informed consent from Friede, and supplying him with documents about the dangers of snake venom, the team collected two vials of Friede’s blood. They isolated antibodies from it and tested them against a panel of toxins from elapid snakes. Antibodies that bound to the toxins were then tested in mice that had been dosed with snake venom. Seeking to add protection against even more species, the researchers tested a third element: varespladib, which inhibits a snake-venom enzyme that breaks down muscle and nerve tissue.Antibodies from snake collector Tim Friede, here with a water cobra (Hydrodynastes gigas), have been used to make a broad-spectrum antivenom.CentivaxThey found that a cocktail made up of varespladib and two antibodies from Friede allowed mice to survive otherwise lethal doses of venom from any one of 19 species of dangerous elapid snakes. One of the antibodies binds to a molecular feature shared by toxins in the LNX family. The other binds to a feature shared by toxins in the SNX family.Glanville says that exact copies of human antibodies could pose less risk of adverse reactions than those based on animal antibodies and broad-spectrum synthetic antibodies designed with computational approaches.Sunagar and other scientists expressed concerns about the ethics of this research, because of the risks Friede took. But he also says that the study is well executed, and shows that combinations of small-molecule drugs such as varespladib and monoclonal antibodies — copies of human antibodies — hold promise. However, it’s not clear whether these antibodies can be produced at an industrial scale for an affordable price, he says.Jean-Philippe Chippaux, a specialist in venomous-snake bites and an emeritus researcher at the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development in Paris, says that the main challenge in addressing snake bite is not the efficacy of the treatments, but the fact that they are often administered too late. “We need to think about ways to bring antivenoms closer to the areas where venomous snake bites occur and to convince patients to come to the hospital more quickly,” he says. “There is no reason to believe that the new generation of broad-spectrum antibodies will achieve these results.”Glanville says he is thinking about ways to make these therapies more portable and affordable. He also says it’s important to provide proof that the cocktail works in the real world before initiating any human trials.Centivax is planning to test the experimental cocktail in dogs bitten by snakes in Australia. Dogs will first be given the experimental treatment; if it doesn’t work after a few minutes, they will receive conventional antivenom.This article is reproduced with permission and was first published on May 2, 2025.\", 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Human antibodies create potent broad-spectrum antivenom\\nENTITIES: Tim Friede, Jacob Glanville, Centivax, Peter Kwong, Columbia University\\nEVENT: Scientists created a potent antivenom using antibodies from a man repeatedly bitten by venomous snakes, protecting mice against 19 deadly species.\\nCONTEXT: New antivenom combines existing drug with human-derived antibodies.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 47770, 'sourceId': 917, 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2025/may/07/fox-chase-boy-standup-comedy-confronts-trauma-in-a-catholic-community', 'title': 'Fox Chase Boy: standup comedy confronts trauma in a Catholic community', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T10:05:14.000Z', 'content': 'There is surprising nostalgia and humour in Gerad Argeros’s story of healing after child abuse by a Catholic priest.

The firm will also not have to pay the contributions. The deal will be reciprocal for British workers transferred to workplaces in India.Officials have not provided an assessment of the cost or impact on UK businesses.The change is understood to have been a key demand by New Delhi’s negotiators who said the agreement, which has been three years in the making, will result in ‘significant financial gains’ for Indian companies.The deal will also see the UK lower tariffs on clothes, shoes and food such as frozen prawns from the subcontinent, in exchange for reciprocal cuts for products including whisky and cars.But the tax break – omitted from the UK press release on the pact – immediately provoked anger.Grim figures yesterday revealed the UK’s services sector had shrunk for the first time in 18 months, blamed on the NI increase – which came into force in April – and Donald Trump’s trade war.Tory business spokesman Harriett Baldwin told the Commons: ‘This Government is literally putting up taxes for British workers, but cutting them for Indian workers.

It is nothing short of a betrayal of working people in this country.’Defending the deal, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds pointed to equivalent agreements with the EU, the US and South Korea under the Double Contribution Convention.‘It means that when our people are moved by a company to India they will be paying into the UK system and not the Indian system, and when Indian people are temporarily in the UK they’ll be paying into their system and not to ours,’ he said. ‘But it’s very specific as to who this applies to.’But Tory MP Nick Timothy said ministers were ‘conning’ the public, adding: ‘These changes will create a massive incentive for UK firms to work with Indian service providers, undercutting domestic workers, companies and contractors.’ Reform leader Nigel Farage said: ¿In Starmer¿s Britain, people who have grown up here, worked hard, paid their taxes and propped up the economy are effectively being asked to pay to put themselves out of work' Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the deal 'means that when our people are moved by a company to India they will be paying into the UK system and not the Indian system' Indian nationals accounted for the highest proportion of UK work visas issued last year.

She lived in Solihull.As my sister had no family in the UK I had to arrange her care, register her death and make funeral arrangements from the other side of the world.

What are they attracted to? A siren's mix of tax-free wages, five-star medicine, almost no crime, and unlimited business prospects. No surprise that some 20,000 Brits have already set off for this Arabian peninsula haven!The Popularity of QatarSocial media is really abuzz with Qatar content today. Young Brits are inundating TikTok with viral clips of the just-about-impossible security – individuals leaving keys scattered across the bonnets of high-end cars for hours, then returning to find nothing disturbed. Have a go at that in London and see what happens!In the past, the United Arab Emirates have been the most popular nation with its two biggest cities, Dubai and Abu Dhabi, but now young people are being enticed to move to Qatar, especially Britons.Doha gained popularity as it hosted 2022 FIFA World Cup, where the world was exposed to the Qatari culture and innovative architecture. Even adding their national team to the popular game FC (previously FIFA franchise), where foreigners started meeting the biggest players from the Qatar team.A Cheaper LifestyleHere's the kicker – despite being one of the planet's richest countries thanks to its oil and gas bonanza, Qatar is surprisingly affordable compared to the UK. According to the Daily Mail, living costs in Britain are a whopping 34.2% higher than in Qatar. Restaurant prices? Nearly 50% more expensive back home. Groceries? 41.5% pricier in Britain.Even a McDonald's meal will leave your wallet significantly lighter in London than in Doha. Combine cheaper everyday costs with juicy business opportunities (especially in real estate), fewer crowds, and that sweet, sweet tax-free income, and you can see why Qatar is stealing the crown from its neighbors.Sports as Image LaunderingPrior to the World Cup, due to the country's poor football infrastructure, new stadiums and hotels had to be built in order to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup. During the construction process, more than 400 people lost their lives, as working conditions were extremely poor. Fatal accidents included falls from dozens of metres and heat strokes largely due to the lack of rest, hydration, and food suffered by the workers.The entire World Cup process was criticised globally, with hundreds of reports exposing the cruelty in which Qatar had been involved and arguing that the country did not deserve to host a World Cup. However, when it came down to it, these reports and criticisms did not have a tangible impact.Despite multiple boycott attempts against the sporting event, more than 1.4 million tourists travelled to Qatar for the World Cup, many without tickets. In total, 3.4 million people attended the matches. When multiplying the average ticket price of £187 ($250), it results in a total of £636 million ($850m) in just under a month.And this figure only accounts for match attendance, not including accommodation, flights, tourism, souvenirs, and stadium purchases. Therefore, the total amount of money generated in just one month exceeded one billion dollars — a ridiculous sum, which would not have been reached if people truly cared about the human rights violations that occurred during the 2022 World Cup preparations.Inspired by Abu Dhabi's success with its investment in Manchester City and the exposure gained by its most prominent tourism brand, Etihad, Qatar decided to follow suit in 2011 by purchasing the French club Paris Saint-Germain through its government investment fund, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), with Nasser Al-Khelaifi as the main figure behind the project.Al-Khelaifi being one of the best friends of the Qatar emir was appointed by him in the project. This strategy resulted in a dramatic rise in the popularity of Qatar Airways as a brand, and it has also boosted Qatar's visibility as an institution and a popular tourist destination for football fans.Despite ongoing criticism from human rights groups, the Qatari government's aggressive promotion through sports and their flagship airline continues to pay dividends. Many seem willing to overlook troubling human rights issues in exchange for the lifestyle perks Qatar offers.For a growing number of young Britons weighing their options in a cost-of-living crisis, Qatar represents an irresistible opportunity – controversy be damned.

The financial guru, Martin Lewis and his team at MoneySavingExpert.com, highlighted the concerning trend that up to 900,000 patients are reportedly overlooking significant savings as per recent analysis.The NHS prescription prepayment certificate (PPC) system is crafted to support England\\'s patients in reducing their medication expenses. An NHS PPC operates much like a prepaid card, presenting it to your pharmacist allows you to collect necessary medications without the per-item charge.With each prescription in England carrying a fee of £9.90, individuals often find themselves footing the bill for multiple items concurrently. Urging awareness, MoneySavingExpert.com founder Martin Lewis expressed: \"We need to spread the word to anyone in England who regularly gets prescriptions – including some with chronic illnesses – to check out prepayment certificates.\"He strongly advises acting promptly to secure these savings: \"And do it sooner rather than later. Doing it now would mean you pay less for longer. My simple rule of thumb is if you get more than one prescription a month on average, a prepayment certificate is the cheapest option as it caps what you pay. They give you unlimited prescriptions for either three months or a year. For someone using an average of two prescriptions a month, it\\'d be a £120 saving and it\\'d reduce the worry if you needed more, as you wouldn\\'t have to shell out more.\"According to the NHS, approximately 872,000 patients could have potentially saved around £35 million (£41 each on average) in 2023/24 by purchasing a 12-month Prepayment Certificate (PPC). There are two prepayment options available and once purchased, it covers all your prescriptions for that period, reports the Liverpool Echo.For the first time since 2022, prices will remain unchanged for 2025 and are listed below.Three-month prepayment certificate - £32.0512-month prepayment certificate - £114.50 There\\'s also a specific PPC for hormone replacement therapy: 12-month HRT prepayment certificate - £19.80Someone who gets two prescriptions each month for 12 months would save more than £100, compared with paying for individual prescriptions.

That deal, reportedly worth close to $1 million per season, has yet again become a major point of contention as speculation around his long-term future resurfaces.Oliver the missing piece for the Cats? | 01:43A potential move to Geelong last year was heavily publicised, as was an alleged mega offer from Adelaide back in 2023. It left Oliver to be told by Melbourne he was ‘on the trade table’ at the back end of 2024, after not performing to his usually-lofty standards by his own admission.With the three-time All-Australian having temporarily stepped away from senior selection, conversations around his long-term standing at the Demons are again gathering momentum.Oliver’s worth in 2030 could reportedly be worth as much as $1.7 million in the last year of his contract. It is a sum that looms as a significant hurdle for any club to jump over, let alone Geelong, whose list management strategy has rarely revolved around large salaries. The Cats have rarely splashed big money on individual players — Patrick Dangerfield’s arrival in 2016 and Jeremy Cameron’s at the end of 2020 the two notable exceptions.That salary — and Geelong’s typical caution with big-money deals — is the central roadblock.For the Cats to land the inside bull, they would need to make even further cuts to the wages of several players already on contracts below their market value. Alternatively, they would have to rely on the Demons continuing to subsidise a portion of Oliver’s wage post-departure — an arrangement that, while uncommon, has precedent in modern footy.Clayton Oliver of the Demons. Picture: Jonathan DiMaggio/AFL Photos/via Getty ImagesSource: Getty ImagesSo, while the latter solution might sound easy enough for the Cats to strike a deal with, it will be incredibly difficult (to say the least) for Melbourne to come to terms with and accept.If a trade were to happen, it would almost certainly have to involve a multi-club deal or future picks; particularly if the Demons were set in stone on not carrying too much of his salary burden. For Geelong, the prospect of pairing Oliver with Max Holmes and new star recruit Bailey Smith, you would think, is still very enticing.As the ladder stands heading into Round 9, the Cats hold Picks 12, 30, 48 and 66. It would be wishful thinking to say that draft hand alone is enough for a trade to go through — and that’s before taking into account the value of his playing contract.So ahead of Round 9, there appears to be no genuine rival suitor for Oliver.“I think he’s playing at Melbourne (in 2026),” ex-teammate and four-time premiership player Jordan Lewis told Fox Footy’s On The Couch on Monday night.“I would think, for another club to take him, a half-a-million-dollar pay-cut — at least, per year.“To say it in simple terms like that, I think it’s inevitable that he stays at Melbourne, and I don’t know what they need to work through to make sure that he’s happy and healthy in that environment, but I just think it would be too difficult to go somewhere else.”Would Oliver take a big pay cut to walk? | 02:05Melbourne have remained publicly supportive of Oliver’s growth after concerns with his off-field behaviour, but the writing may already be on the wall. The club was open to offers last year, and may well be again — despite the public narrative that they expect him to be a Demon for life.“I expect him to be (at the club next year),” teammate Jack Viney declared on Tuesday. “He’s a terrific teammate, I don’t expect not to be otherwise.”Despite that support, there’s also a risk in not trading Oliver and retaining him.After a strong pre-season, Oliver’s output this season on the surface looks sound, averaging 27.6 disposals, 14.4 contested possessions, 7.0 clearances, 5.3 tackles and 4.9 score involvements.But according to Champion Data’s Player ratings system, he’s the 211th-ranked player in the competition — a light improvement on last year (244th) but still a far cry from his brilliant stint between 2018 and 2022 where he was among the top 30 players in four of out five seasons — and in the top 10 twice. He’s polled just one vote in AFL Coaches’ Association Champion Player of the Year so far this year — an award he won back-to-back in 2021 and 2022.Considering he’s still only 27, there’s still every chance Oliver can find that blistering form that made him one of the most dynamic inside midfielders in the competition. But would he be more likely to reach those heights at another club in a fresh environment, rather than at Melbourne considering the array of recent issues?Clayton Oliver of the Demons. Picture: Robert Cianflone/Getty ImagesSource: Getty ImagesKeeping Oliver, too, would swallow up a decent portion of the Demons’ salary cap. They already have Christian Petracca (2029) and Jacob Van Rooyen (2029) on long-term deals, veterans Jack Viney (2028) and Max Gawn (2027) both still have several years left and first-round draftees Caleb Windsor (2028) and Koltyn Tholstrup (2028) have already extended their deals. And then there’s fellow first-round picks Harvey Langford and Xavier Lindsay (both 2027), who automatically signed three-year contracts last year.The Demons would love to pick in-form star Kysaiah Pickett, who’s contracted to the club until at least the end of 2027 but has been heavily linked to an interstate move at season’s end. Whether the Demons would be prepared to keep paying a portion of Pickett’s salary in exchange for more top-end picks — or get the cash off their books and take a later draft compensation — remains unclear.Either way, retaining Oliver could require a bit of a Dees cap juggling act.Speaking on Fox Footy’s AFL 360 on Tuesday night, Melbourne great Garry Lyon suggested how the Demons can best approach what is quickly becoming a truly unique ‘trade’ timeline.“I respect the call they made last week (to not play Oliver). It seemed to speak to a bit of maturity between both club, and player, that they’ve come together more meaningly than they have in the past,” he said.Lyon added: “My position’s always been keep your superstars … but I do acknowledge that this is now at a really delicate stage.Oliver playing against Geelong in Round 17, 2022 at GMHBA Stadium (Photo by Dylan Burns via Getty Images)Source: Getty Images“What they need to do is to continue in this vein of being open, honest and transparent — totally. Cards on table. No ‘I’ll go make a few calls on your behalf’, and no whipping down to Geelong behind your back.“I think there’s a really interesting month (or two) ahead.”While there is no suggestion that a move is imminent, the relationship between Oliver and the club remains under close watch. The idea of a parting post-2025 is, again, no longer far-fetched.The risk factor for any suitor, Geelong or otherwise, is significant. Not just in salary, but in stability. Would Oliver thrive in a new environment, or would a move only deepen the challenges he’s currently working through?The Cats have a long-standing history under Chris Scott of being able to bring out the best of all types of characters and personalities. Right now, the club — and by extension, the competition — are embracing Bailey Smith as much as any player in recent memory.An Oliver storyline may feel familiar, but the speculation has been reignited. And if he is to walk, it won’t be simple.

With his death, a burgeoning artistic career was cut short. Majerus had been the subject of a solo museum exhibition in Switzerland, in 1996, and he’d created a major installation for the Venice Biennale, in 1999. There would be no more of his innovative œuvre, which included individual painted canvases in addition to room-scale installations smashing together the vocabulary of early digital culture—lo-fi video games, internet-y typefaces—with aggressive brushstrokes and flat planes of color borrowed from Abstract Expressionism and Minimalism. Majerus’s souped-up Apple PowerBook G3 laptop, however, survived the wreck—at least, the hard drive did.The computer remained with his estate for many years, a relic left untouched. During that time, Majerus’s paintings continued to be shown in galleries and museums, exerting a quiet but persistent influence on a generation of artists who were creating work using and responding to the internet. Then, in 2017, the artist Cory Arcangel, famous for his digital art works, became aware of Majerus’s hard drive and began a quest to access its contents. What prompted Arcangel’s interest was an untitled painting of Majerus’s, from 2000, that an assistant had shown him on Instagram. The background is covered in acid-pastel blocks of color, reminiscent of the Neo-Geo movement of the nineteen-eighties, but the foreground contains evocative phrases in text that looks pulled from Geocities or a “Matrix”-era rave poster: “Newcomer,” “burned out,” “fuck the intention of the artist.” Majerus had intuited that the internet would lead to a great collision of styles and reference points—everything from Super Mario to Jackson Pollock coexisting in pixels. The untitled painting inspired nostalgia for the dial-up millennial generation, but Arcangel, whose own work includes a hacked version of “Super Mario Bros.” with only its clouds remaining, was also struck by how contemporary it seemed. During a recent Google Meet call from an austere apartment that a gallery representing the Majerus Estate maintains in Berlin, Arcangel said, “It just came at me from a hundred different angles, and each one of these little things sent me off into a spiral of associations.”Given Majerus’s incorporation of digital imagery, such as video-game sprites, and the fluency of his tech-culture references, Arcangel guessed that Majerus was as much a digital artist as an analog painter. Perhaps the laptop held the key to his process. Arcangel brought the hard drive to the attention of Dragan Espenschied, the preservation director at Rhizome, a New York institution that archives the history of art created in digital environments. There was a risk that the hardware might malfunction and the stored files would be lost forever. The Majerus Estate commissioned a data rescue company to create a digital copy of the drive. Then, Espenschied used an emulator—a piece of software that mimics the entire architecture of an older device—to boot up a facsimile of the laptop, including its early-two-thousands operating system and the pixellated file icons on Majerus’s cluttered desktop, which featured a background image from Ms. Pac-Man. This was his computer exactly as he had left it, down to his customized Photoshop shortcuts and the positions of the windows. “It’s like he just stepped out of the room,” Arcangel said.The contents of the computer revealed Majerus to be an artist who was “aggressively digital-native,” Arcangel said. From the files, Arcangel could reconstruct how Majerus had downloaded and collaged images of geometrically shaped Frank Stella paintings from the nineteen-sixties, zooming in, slicing them apart, and rotating them, then using them as the basis for his own wall-size, triangular “pressure groups” paintings, from 2002. Majerus used Photoshop to design his paintings and then virtually install them in specific gallery spaces in advance, tailoring the layout down to the inch, before his brush ever touched canvas. Arcangel has described Majerus as a kind of robotic “printer,” making all his decisions in advance and then rendering the output by hand.The laptop also contained poignant artifacts of Majerus’s life: a photo of what appears to be a tiny New York City hotel room, with the artist’s chunky black laptop on the hotel bed alongside a bulky power adapter, a pizza box, candy, and a binder of compact disks, a television blaring in the background. What emerges is a portrait of the artist as an itinerant hacker, and a snapshot of digital creation in the years before social media or the advent of the cloud. “There’s only a few years where somebody would have carried around their whole studio with them,” Arcangel said.Arcangel, who is forty-six, has a background in music composition but transitioned into visual art in the two-thousands, using a laptop similar to Majerus’s to create his early work. As Arcangel explored Majerus’s computer, he found himself remembering reflexively how to navigate the vintage software. The digital tools are part of the legacy of Majerus’s work—his art makes viewers recall what it was like to use the Photoshop paint bucket or burn a CD, back when those were radical technological experiences. Arcangel began recording a series of YouTube videos titled “Let’s Play Majerus G3,” riffing on the genre of Twitch-stream videos that capture creators playing video games. Last weekend in Berlin, Arcangel performed an iteration of “Let’s Play Majerus G3” at the Majerus Estate for an audience of a hundred gallerygoers, talking through the artist’s desktop and pulling up his favorite files. They included one of the only existing videos of Majerus painting, and a Photoshop image in which the artist had made a digital sketch, then edited that sketch into a photograph of his studio, visualizing what it would be like if the digital image were a canvas leaning against the wall, as if it were a physical work-in-progress. In this way, Arcangel explained, Majerus seemed to merge his computer and his IRL studio into one creative space.Digital art has thus far not proved to be particularly durable. There are now more than two decades’ worth of experimental websites, art projects on defunct social networks, and vernacular digital images that have simply been lost to technological obsolescence and disuse. Majerus’s laptop, and Arcangel’s archival work and performances, represent an effort to insert the visual legacy of our era into the longer arc of art history, to immortalize the ephemeral modus vivendi of a particular technological moment. On our video chat, Arcangel pulled up another collage in which Majerus had placed images of his work next to photos of vintage Stella exhibitions, installations of the Neo-Geo painter Peter Halley’s work, and a more recent Stella painting that Majerus had encountered in a Manhattan skyscraper lobby. He was measuring his own accomplishments against those of his influences, merging art-historical references with his own output across time, on his super-powered laptop. Majerus’s art work was birthed on the screen, and through his recovered files, Arcangel said, “We get to see over the shoulder of one of the best artists to ever do it.” ♦', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Arcangel recovers Majerus's digital art legacy\\nENTITIES: Cory Arcangel, Michel Majerus, Dragan Espenschied, Rhizome\\nEVENT: Cory Arcangel recovered Michel Majerus's hard drive after his death in a plane crash, revealing his digital art process and merging of digital and physical art.\\nCONTEXT: Cory Arcangel recovers Michel Majerus's digital artistic legacy.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 47120, 'sourceId': 890, 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/us/politics/white-house-melania-absence.html', 'title': 'A Most Sensitive Subject in the White House: Where Is Melania?', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T21:12:08.000Z', 'content': 'You have a preview view of this article while we are checking your access.

He reported from Washington. May 7, 2025Updated 5:12 p.m. ETThe lights never seem to be on and the shutters stay shut.As the weeks pass by at the White House, the corner of the residence long used by first ladies remains dark, because this first lady does not really live in Washington. Melania Trump vanishes from view for weeks at a time, holing up in Trump Tower in Manhattan or in Florida, where she can lie low at Mar-a-Lago. Administration officials say she is at the White House more often than the public knows, but when exactly, and for how long, these officials will not (or perhaps cannot) say for certain.It’s like having Greta Garbo as first lady.Mrs. Trump is expected to reappear in the capital on Thursday to unveil a postage stamp honoring Barbara Bush, the former first lady, and to attend a ceremony for military mothers. But two people with knowledge of Mrs. Trump’s schedule said she had spent fewer than 14 days at the White House since her husband was inaugurated 108 days ago. Others say even that is a generous estimate. Officials in the East Wing and West Wing declined multiple requests for comment for this article.That the first lady’s whereabouts is among the most sensitive of subjects in this White House only adds to the intrigue. “We haven’t seen such a low-profile first lady since Bess Truman, and that’s going way back in living human memory, nearly 80 years ago,” said Katherine Jellison, a historian at Ohio University whose research has focused on first ladies. She said that, like Mrs. Trump, Mrs. Truman spent much of her time running back to “her home base whenever she had the chance.” (In Mrs. Truman’s case, that was Independence, Mo.) “She just kind of liked her own private world,” Ms. Jellison said.The same is true of this first lady. She has hired staff to work for her in the East Wing, but she rarely goes into the office. Even regulars at Mar-a-Lago say they don’t often see Mrs. Trump around the premises.

The suit, which identifies the women only as Jane Does 1 through 4, says Mr. Robinson raped them repeatedly while his wife, Frances, who is a co-defendant, turned a blind eye.In a statement provided to The New York Times, Mr. Robinson’s lawyer, Christopher Frost, called the suit “an ugly method of trying to extract money from an 85-year-old American icon.”“We ask anyone following this case to reserve judgment as the evidence comes to light and all the actual facts of the case unfold,” Mr. Frost said.The lawsuit, which was filed on Tuesday in Superior Court in Los Angeles, says that three of the women feared reporting Mr. Robinson to the authorities because of their immigration status. “As low-wage workers in vulnerable positions, they lacked the resources and options necessary to protect themselves from sexual assaults throughout their tenure as employees for the Robinsons,” their lawyer, John Harris, said on Tuesday.The lawsuit goes into graphic detail about the abuse claims.Mr. Robinson, it alleges, would drop off his wife at a nail salon and rush home to assault one of the women while she was alone in the Robinsons’ house in Chatsworth, a Los Angeles neighborhood.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Under-fire footy star Willie Rioli won't play in Port Adelaide's Showdown against the Crows after the forward was investigated for threats to multiple rival players Port president David Koch this week said the club was 'incredibly angry' about the Rioli saga Many footy fans were in disbelief that Rioli wasn't sanctioned by the AFL (he is pictured left, with Port Adelaide coach Ken Hinkley) 'We've talked pretty sternly to Willie about it and said it's just not on,' Koch told 5AA Radio.'I'm making absolutely no excuse for Willie's private message after the game.'But you can't mix on-field and off-field comments or it will lead to places people don't want to go.'It comes as former AFL star Nick Riewoldt slammed the league for inconsistencies in the way it penalises players and has questioned the claim they were unaware of other threats made by Rioli.Riewoldt described the situation as 'another embarrassment' for footy boss Laura Kane.The league's failure to fine or suspend Rioli has infuriated fans, who blasted the sport's bosses for being weak and treating the Port Adelaide star with kid gloves.Respected footy commentator Gerard Whateley also felt the AFL's lack of action was deplorable.'I can't quite fathom where the AFL has landed here....(for me) they are in breach of community standards,' Whateley said on Fox Footy. Willie Rioli allegedly threatened Bailey Dale following Port's loss in round eight - and since then two other incidents have come to light Rioli threatened Bailey Dale (pictured, with his fiancée Erin Meade) after the pair clashed on the field during the Bulldogs' big win over Port Adelaide 'The football public is unhappy to say the least....they (AFL) have pulled up to punish Osama bin Laden masks at an off-season party and flipping the bird, which presumably is done for the likelihood to incite.'They seem to have just completely missed the gravity of a player (Rioli) sending a message to a rival player's teammate threatening (him) the day after a game, which I think, to the common man is going well, that's not only in breach of footy standards, that's borderline in breach of the law.'Bulldogs coach Luke Beveridge earlier this week said he wasn't surprised by the AFL's decision not to sanction Rioli. 'Obviously, Willie has made a mistake, he'll learn from it – and we are all OK with that,' he said.'Let's just make sure it doesn't happen again.'\", 'location': 'AUS', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Rioli investigated for threats, misses Showdown\\nENTITIES: Willie Rioli, Port Adelaide, AFL, Bailey Dale, Western Bulldogs, David Koch, Nick Riewoldt, Laura Kane, Gerard Whateley\\nEVENT: Willie Rioli is sitting out a game after being investigated for allegedly threatening rival AFL players, leading to internal club discussions and external criticism of the AFL's handling of the situation.\\nCONTEXT: Rioli's actions and the AFL's response have sparked widespread criticism and debate about player conduct and league consistency.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 51699, 'sourceId': 12355, 'url': 'https://redstate.com/beccalower/2025/05/07/hhs-sec-rfk-jr-and-nih-director-jay-bhattacharya-autism-n2188810', 'title': 'HHS Sec.

Trump Announces New Nominee for Surgeon General PostOkay, now, here was how the mainstream folks twisted things. The AP\\'s lede read:WASHINGTON (AP) — Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan Wednesday to use medical data and records from people on Medicaid and Medicare to help study autism although experts say it’s unlikely to help reveal the condition’s root causes.The story goes on to act as a wet blanket, quoting the leader of the anti-RFK Jr. group, Coalition of Autism Scientists, Helen Tager-Flusberg, who is a professor emerita at Boston University:“Enough research has been done at this point to know there is no simple magic bullet,” she said, cautioning that this type of dataset won’t help with the type of research most needed — into genetics and other prenatal, preconception and early infancy factors.The Associated Press also made sure readers were aware of \"autism researchers and [advocates\\']\" alarm over RFK Jr.\\'s prior comments about more research being needed on some vaccines.Although later, the article admits the positive fact that HHS included in its announcement that the agency is only beginning to build out a platform to \"study chronic conditions and treatments.\" The work on autism is the cold open, in other words.\\nScience is supposed to be about being open to scientists willing to try surprising and different avenues to find answers. There\\'s no harm in asking questions in science. That\\'s kind of Kennedy\\'s point about conventional medicine, and people\\'s distrust of Big Pharma, when academia and the old guard push back with such ferocity--while Americans are screaming at them that what they\\'re doing isn\\'t working.\\xa0The results of the partnership, in fact, could be fascinating, with an impressive number of cases at their fingertips to investigate.

But when they awoke later in the morning, the two children were gone.The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) proceeded under the belief the children, members of the Mi’kmaq First Nation community of Sipekne’katik, wandered off from their home and probably entered a heavily forested area.Speaking to the media on Tuesday, Staff Sgt Curtis MacKinnon said that dozens of searchers were being ordered to stand down and confirmed that the RCMP’s major crime unit had been involved in the investigation since 3 May.MacKinnon said all missing persons files “are treated as suspicious until our investigation leads us to determine otherwise”.He said teams were left with fewer areas to search after after combing through kilometres of unforgiving terrain. “We’re not packing up and we’re not giving up.”The disappearance of the children has shaken both the province and the country. And despite a boot print that pushed search teams in one direction, police said there is very little evidence suggesting the children are in the forest.“I want to assure you that our missing persons investigation continues,” MacKinnon said.“Many of us have children of our own and want nothing more than to reunite Lily and Jack with their loved ones.”Sgt Robert McCamon said that hopes have dimmed, given the poor weather and length of time the children have been missing.“The likelihood they’re alive right now is very low,” he said.The Globe and Mail reported that Martell was interviewed by police for four hours, as they requested he walk them through both the day of the children’s disappearance and the days leading up to the incident.He also told police the children had not been in school in the days prior to their disappearance.“My story has been consistent. When you tell the truth it’s always consistent,” he told the Globe.He told CTV Atlantic that he had been conducting his own search since the children went missing.“Hardly any evidence at all since the first day.

He struck out seven and walked two. (Eric Sondheimer / Los Angeles Times) Committed to Long Beach State, Howe was repeatedly getting called third strikes with a slider that Birmingham hitters could never figure out whether to take or swing.The only run of the game came in the bottom of the fifth inning on a sacrifice fly from Jackson Sellz that allowed Shane Bogacz to make a headfirst slide at the plate to beat the throw.Once again, Birmingham failed to win a league title in the 19th season for coach Matt Mowry but is in perfect position to win a sixth City title under Mowry. Allen Olmos struck out four in six innings and will team with freshman Carlos Acuna to give the Patriots the needed one-two pitching duo to try to make it to Dodger Stadium on May 24.El Camino Real, a nine-time City champion, will be the likely No. 1 seed when pairings are announced Saturday, and Howe is reminiscent of the great ECR pitchers from the past who led the team to championships, such as Randy Wolf, Kirk Birkins, Jose Cardona and Matt Malconian.

The team has been winning close games with clutch contributions, whether on hits, bunts or fielding plays.There will be an eight-team Open Division, and the challenge for El Camino Real and Birmingham might be having to face fellow West Valley League teams in the opening rounds. The likely teams headed to the Open Division include Venice, Sun Valley Poly, Sylmar, Banning and Cleveland, with Chatsworth, Carson and Bell in the running.Whatever happens, it would not be a surprise to see El Camino Real and Birmingham meet again for the championship at Dodger Stadium.In other action on Tuesday, Sherman Oaks Notre Dame claimed third place in the Mission League with a 5-1 win over St. Francis.

A good-quality arm not only frees up usable space on your desk’s surface, it enables more ways to move and position your display/s for optimal comfort and ergonomics. And a monitor arm makes your office setup look really cool.\\nThe only catch is the price. Most monitor arms worth buying will cost close to $200, and heavy-duty arms capable of holding two large displays can be priced even higher. The good news is that a good-quality monitor arm is likely to last you for a very long time. That’s why it’s important to make the right choice when you purchase a monitor arm.\\nTo help you with that, we’ve tested several popular monitor arms, for both single- and dual-monitor setups. Below you’ll find our curated list of recommendations, with detailed explanations of what features and qualities make them stand out. We even have some good budget recommendations. Below our picks, we point out some arms that we aren’t so keen on — to provide a point of comparison.\\nErgotron LX Pro – Best monitor arm\\nBest Prices Today:\\n£159.12\\nThe Ergotron LX Pro is a practical, effective, easy-to-use monitor arm. Ergotron achieves this ease-of-install with clever, yet simple, engineering.\\nThe LX Pro’s clamp mechanism, which secures the monitor to a desk, takes the extra step of providing a comfortable handhold that makes it easy to work the clamp without tools. The arm’s two sections, meanwhile, simply slip into place. Ergotron also provides thumb screws for attaching the arm’s VESA mount to the back of your monitor.\\nDepending on your monitor, you may need to use the included hex wrench to tighten the components. Otherwise, installation doesn’t require tools.\\nThe arm’s desk clamp mechanism is wide, which is important. Clamps with a small surface concentrate more force on your desk and cause damage if over-tightened. A wider clamp better distributes the force. That means the LX Pro is less likely to damage weaker desks (though caution when tightening the clamp is recommended).\\nFortunately, the arm’s ease of installation doesn’t lead to functional downsides. The arm can support monitors up to 34 inches diagonally that weigh up to 22 pounds. The arm also lifts up to 13 inches, tilts up to 85 degrees, and can swivel and rotate to a full 360 degrees. Cables are routed through channels in the arm and secured by sturdy detachable cladding. Ergotron provides a 10-year warranty.\\nThe LX Pro even fixes our gripes about its predecessor, the Ergotron LX. The LX Pro’s base is more compact, the white colorway now has a color-coordinated VESA mount, and the new design is more attractive. The only downgrade compared to the old Ergotron LX is a lower maximum weight (the LX could handle up to 25 pounds). But that’s unlikely to matter, as 32-inch and 34-inch monitors usually weigh 15 pounds or less.\\nThe LX Pro’s $209 MSRP is enough to make shoppers think twice, but it’s great value for money. The arm’s overall build quality feels competitive with more expensive monitor arms, such as the Humanscale M2.1.\\nThat makes the Ergotron LX Pro an easy recommendation. It’s simple to set up, looks nice, works well in day-to-day use, yet remains affordable. We already liked the Ergotron LX, but the LX Pro is a great upgrade.\\nWorkstream by Monoprice – Best budget monitor arm\\nBest Prices Today:\\n£98.28\\nThe Workstream by Monoprice single monitor arm is a no-frills solution that delivers basic monitor arm features at an exceptionally low price.\\nThe monitor arm has an all-metal construction that in some ways feels sturdier than the Ergotron LX, as the Workstream doesn’t include as much plastic cladding. It’s not entirely a win, though, as the plastic that exists feels frail (and I even broke a small, though unnoticeable, bit while adjusting the monitor).\\nIt provides a good range of adjustment, with 13.2 inches of height and 90 degrees of tilt, swivel, and rotation. The arm’s height and tilt adjustment are comparable to others on this list, but it can’t swivel in a full circle, which may prove annoying if you frequently move a monitor arm to share your screen with colleagues.\\nThe Workstream’s slim budget is felt in its difficult setup and stiff operation. Users will need to install several screws for a clamp or gromet mount. More screws may need to be adjusted once the arm is in place, as its default tension proved inadequate for supporting a 32-inch monitor.\\nMonoprice lists the monitor as capable of supporting 20 pounds, but I felt the 32-inch monitor (which weighed 15 pounds) was pushing the Workstream to its limits. Monoprice also skimps on the warranty, offering just one year of coverage.\\nThese flaws are easily excused by the Workstream’s $60 price tag. It’s clearly less capable, less attractive, and more difficult to use than Ergotron’s LX, but it offers a good range of adjustment and durable construction for less than half the price. It’s an ideal choice for shoppers on a tight budget, as well as those who plan to install a small, light 24-inch or 27-inch monitor.\\nHuanuo HNSS6 Single Monitor Arm – Best monitor arm under $50\\nBest Prices Today:\\n£29.99\\nThe Huanuo HNSS6 Single Monitor Arm is easily our go-to recommendation for shoppers looking to buy the least expensive monitor arm that can still fulfill its job.\\nThe arm comes in two pieces: The lower portion swivels while the upper portion allows for height, tilt, and rotation adjustments. A gas spring provides tension to keep monitors aloft, which is an upgrade from the clips and screws used by the least expensive arms. However, it’s worth noting that gas springs can lose their potency over time. These features are typical for the price: Most competitors are similar in design and use a gas cylinder.\\nWhat makes the Huanuo a winner is its overall quality and ease of install. Setup required installation of just three screws (and adjustment to a couple more). The clamp used to mount the arm to the desk was intuitive compared to rivals like the MountUp Single Monitor Arm, as the spacing of the clamp is adjustable without removing and re-installing screws to secure it. The arm claims to hold 32-inch displays up to 20 pounds, which is enough to hold most monitors. We tested it with panels up to 32 inches weighing up to 12 pounds, and it supported those with ease.\\nOne notable downside is cable management. The plastic covers provided are finicky and won’t hold many wires, so if you want to add USB cables in addition to a video connection and power, you’re probably out of luck. To be fair, though, the same is true of most inexpensive arms.\\nThe Huanuo wasn’t as easy to set up or adjust as the Ergotron LX, our favorite overall pick, and it’s not as sturdy as the Monoprice Single Monitor Arm, which typically sells for $60. Still, the Huanuo gets the job done.\\nHerman Miller Flo – Best upscale monitor arm\\nPrice When Reviewed:\\n£205\\nBest Prices Today:\\nHerman Miller\\n£205\\nWant a monitor arm that gets the job done and looks good doing it? The Herman Miller Flo is for you.\\nThe Flo’s design sets it apart from the pack. Herman Miller ditches the angular, industrial design of many competitors for a smooth, natural look. While clearly designed for a corporate office, it also fits in with a home office setup, where its friendly, approachable look helps it blend in with its surroundings. The Flo is backed by a 12-year warranty and offers 24/7 customer service.\\nIt’s easy to set up and use. The monitor’s clamp works similarly to other monitor arms I tested, but it’s more refined and requires fewer screws (a grommet is also available). The VESA mount is also excellent, providing a simple clip design that’s secure and can be easily pre-mounted to a monitor for simple installation. The way this mount works accommodates monitors that have a slightly recessed mount position, which may cause problems for other monitor arms.\\nThe monitor’s range of adjustment isn’t much different from other high-end monitor arms. It offers 13.3 inches of vertical adjustment, 80 degrees of tilt, and 360 degrees of swivel and rotation. That’s essentially identical to the less expensive Ergotron LX. The Flo’s operation is smoother, however: I found I could adjust a monitor’s height with a mere nudge.\\nSurprisingly, the Flo has a listed weight limit of 20 pounds and recommends use with monitors weighing at least 7 pounds. Most monitors fit within this range, but some heavier models won’t be compatible with the Flo.\\nHerman Miller lists the Flo at $295, which is a lot to ask for a single-monitor arm. The Ergotron LX offers similar features at a much lower price. However, the Flo is a smoother, more appealing monitor arm, and worth the upgrade if you want form with your function.\\nErgotron HX – Best heavy-duty monitor arm\\nBest Prices Today:\\n£259\\n£273\\nCDW\\n$349\\nIt’s natural, given the only slight difference in name, to think the Ergotron HX is merely an uprated version of the Ergotron LX. That’s not the case. This is an entirely different monitor arm which pairs its increased capacity with improved build quality and a more professional look.\\nFirst, let’s talk weight. The Ergotron HX is rated to hold monitors that weigh up to 42 pounds and screen sizes up to 49 inches. That’s an extraordinarily high weight limit—I haven’t reviewed a single monitor in 2023 that exceeds it. I attached both a 32-inch widescreen and 38-inch ultrawide monitor, which weighed roughly 15 and 20 pounds, respectively, and the HX easily handled both.\\nThe use of plastic is minimal and reserved for small portions of cladding that appear used only for cable routing. The arm’s moving parts include larger, sturdier mechanisms, and felt extremely smooth in my use. Ergotron backs the arm with a 10-year warranty.\\nThe monitors range of adjustment is a bit limited compared to the LX. It offers 11.5 inches of height, 75 degrees of tilt, 180 degrees of swivel, and 360 degrees of rotation. However, a somewhat more limited height adjustment is typical in this category due to the size of monitors these stands are expected to carry.\\nThe monitor arm’s impressive design also provides a more robust look. This could be a con for some, however, as the arm can seem a bit…much in a home office setup. It’s an expensive arm, as well. Expect to pay about $350.\\nThe Ergotron HX is an obvious choice if you want to mount an ultrawide, super-ultrawide, or large format widescreen monitor on your desk.\\nHumanscale M2.1 with M/Connect – Best monitor arm w/ built-in dock\\nBest Prices Today:\\nHumanscale\\n$356\\nThe Humanscale M2.1 with M/Connect laptop docking station is an attractive, robust, and modern monitor arm that can expand your laptop’s connectivity without taking up additional space on your desktop.\\nHumanscale’s entry-level M2.1 doesn’t include a laptop dock, but it’s designed to accommodate the M/Connect 3, which nestles snuggly into the base of the arm. Most home office shoppers will likely choose the M/Connect 3 USB Data Hub, which currently retails for $253 (on top of the M2.1’s base price of $356). The hub adds three USB-C ports and two USB-A ports. If you want even more ports, the $600 M/Connect 3 Pro Dock adds two more USB-A ports, two more USB-C, Ethernet, and two DisplayPort ports.\\nThe M/Connect 3’s added connectivity is an excellent way to expand the ports on a laptop. Its central location makes the ports easy to access and keeps them firmly located in a set position on your desk (as opposed to freestanding hubs and adapters, which tend to get shoved around, or off, a desk). It’s also a good alternative to a USB-C monitor. We like USB-C monitors, but packing connectivity into the monitor can make it difficult to access some ports, as most are located on the rear of the display.\\nConnectivity aside, the Humanscale M2.1 is a robust, if conventional, monitor arm. It can handle monitors between 5 and 15 pounds, which is enough to support the vast majority of widescreen monitors under 32 inches in size. It also has a “smart stop” feature, which lets users customize the amount of rotation the arm allows, and easy-to-use quick release joints that are handy when disassembling or moving the arm. The arm isn’t as smooth in operation as the Herman Miller Flo, but it remains easy enough to adjust.\\nBest Prices Today:\\n£304.54\\nCDW\\n$415\\nTwo monitors are always better than one, and the same goes for monitor arms. It’s no surprise, then, that Ergotron’s LX Side-by-Side ranks as our best dual monitor arm. The Ergotron LX Side-by-Side pairs two LX monitor arms together on one mount. The look, feel, and specifications of each arm are close to its standalone sibling.\\nMonitor size is one exception: While the standard LX is rated for monitors up to 34 inches, the Side-by-Side’s arm is only rated for monitors up to 27 inches. The monitor arms aren’t long enough to fit two 32-inch or 34-inch monitors side-by-side. Vertical arrangements are also supported, though only if one of the two monitors is small (less than 23 inches diagonal).\\nLook and feel is otherwise similar to the standard Ergotron LX, and that’s why the dual monitor arm also earns a recommendation. The dual-monitor arm provides the same winning balance of build quality, adjustability, and smooth operation, and it’s backed by the same 10-year warranty. \\xa0Pricing is a bit higher at $330, which is a slight savings compared to buying two LX arms individually.\\nWorkstream by Monoprice Dual Monitor Arm – Best budget dual monitor arm\\nPrice When Reviewed:\\n£116\\nBest Prices Today:\\n£86.38\\nThe same logic that applies to our favorite dual monitor arm also to the budget model, giving Monoprice’s Workstream Dual Monitor Arm a clear path to victory.\\nIn fact, the dual arm’s pricing is even more impressive. The Workstream Dual Monitor is four times less expensive than the Ergotron LX Side-by-Side. I’m a bit shocked by the quality Monoprice can offer at a $100 price point. Ergotron’s alternative is more attractive and easier to use, but is it four times better? That’s a tough call.\\nThe Workstream’s downsides are identical to standard model. Build quality is impressive for the price, but the arm is difficult to set up and not as smooth in operation. I’m also doubtful the arm is capable of handling two 20-pound monitors, as its spec sheets claim. Fortunately, 27-inch monitors (the largest this arm can handle side-by-side) usually weigh less than 10 pounds, so weight capacity shouldn’t be an issue.\\nHuanuo HNDS12 – Best mid-range dual monitor arm\\nPrice When Reviewed:\\n£119.99\\nBest Prices Today:\\nHuanuo\\n£119.99\\nThe Huanuo HNDS12 represents a middle ground for shoppers who want an upgrade in quality but need to respect their budget.\\nEach monitor arm is almost all metal with only a small piece of plastic to provide cable routing. The arm also has gas springs capable of lifting up to 26 pounds of weight, which is enough to handle 32-inch widescreen and 34-inch ultrawide monitors.\\nThere’s one unusual feature: a USB hub. This includes two USB ports that are placed at the front of the arm base. Each of these will need to plug in to your computer, which might be a problem if you have a laptop with just a few ports, but it’s a functional bonus.\\nThe Huanuo HNDS12, like the HNDS6 (below), is a bit fiddly to set up. It has two clamps that need to be adjusted and roughly a dozen screws that need to be installed. The gas springs also require a bit of adjustment to reduce the force provide, at least when used with a 24-inch or 27-inch monitor.\\nStill, the HNDS12 is a good pick at its regular retail price of $140, which often drops as low as $110 when on sale. It looks attractive and offers plenty of force for holding larger monitors.\\nClearspace Uni-2 – Best upscale dual monitor arm\\nBest Prices Today:\\nClearspace Design\\n$649\\nThe Clearspace Uni-2’s design is a bit different from most competitors. It places two individual arms on a single pole. Each arm can adjust for height, swivel, and tilt, and each monitor mounts to an “independent slider” which can move right or left, making it easier to tune the placement of each monitor relative to the other. Compared to the Humanscale M8.1, I found the Uni-2 easier to adjust. However, the Humanscale M8.1’s beefy crossbar is likely to prove more stable if you’re mounting large monitors.\\nI think the Clearspace Uni-2 looks great, and that’s important. Competitors from Humanscale and Herman Miller also look luxurious but have a more corporate or “executive’s office” vibe. The Uni-2’s softer look feels more appropriate for a home office. Clearspace also provides black, silver, and white colorways, and every component of each colorway is molded in the promised color (which isn’t true of most competitors). Clearspace also throws in subtle touches, like soft-touch inserts on the side of each monitor arm. That’s the kind of design a home office user will appreciate.\\nClearspace also looks to separate itself with connectivity. The Uni-2 comes standard Smart Hub that provides a single USB-A and USB-C port. That’s a small edge over competitors, which often sell the dock as an upgrade. Owners can improve the basic hub with the optional SmartDock (pictured), which expands connectivity to include additional USB ports, HDMI, and Ethernet. Unfortunately, I can’t recommend it: The SmartDock is priced at $650 yet lacks support for features I’d expect at that price, like 4K 60Hz video and 2.5Gbps Ethernet.\\nWhile the optional SmartDock is a miss, the arm is a winner. The Clearspace Uni-2 is expensive, but the price can be justified if you’re picky about the look and feel of your home office space. Clearspace also offers a single-monitor and triple-monitor arm: While I didn’t test them, I expect they’d offer similar perks.\\nMonitor arms that we don’t recommend\\nMountUp MU0004 Single Monitor Arm\\nThe MountUp MU0004 Single Monitor Arm seems like an even more affordable alternative to the Huanuo HNSS6. They look similar in photos, and each has a gas spring. However, the MountUp’s lower price — usually $5 to $10 less than the Huanuo — comes with some compromises.\\nThe MountUp arm was more difficult to install. This is due to the clamp, which has a two-piece design that requires screws be removed and re-installed when adjusting the clamp’s size. Adjustment of the clamp was also a bit more difficult, as turning the knob required more force, and the clamp lacks a rubberized pad to prevent it from marking the underside of your desk. \\xa0We also didn’t like the MountUp’s fit and finish. It had a coarse, matte feel that seemed more industrial than the Huanuo, and miles behind the Ergotron LX.\\nIt’s not all bad news. MonutUp says the monitor arm can support 32-inch displays up to 17 pounds. That’s rather heavy for a modern monitor, and it easily handled a 32-inch display weighing 12 pounds. While inferior to the Huanuo, the MonutUp could work if you don’t mind fiddling with a few more screws during installation and can overlooks is lackluster build quality.\\nStill, it’s hard to justifying paying $30 for the MonutUp if you can bug the Huanuo for $40 (or even $50). A monitor arm can last for years, so spending a few extra bucks for a better experience makes sense.\\nVivo STAND-V002 Dual Monitor Stand\\nBest Prices Today:\\n£27.99\\nAt the time we bought it for testing, the Vivo STAND-V002 was ranked as the second best-selling monitor arm on Amazon. That’s a shame, because it’s easily the worst arm we’ve tested so far.\\nTo be fair, it’s also the least expensive. The STAND-V002 is typically sold below $30. That’s less than many top-selling single monitor arms! Vivo achieves that by cutting the arm’s features to the bone.\\nAdjustability is minimal, so much so that Vivo (mostly) advertises the STAND-V002 as a “desk mount” or “stand” instead of an arm. It has a clamp, a pole, and two jointed arms that attach to the pole at a single point. You can adjust the monitors for height, but only together: One can’t be higher than the other. The arms, meanwhile, have joints that allow swivel and adjustment side-to-side, as well as tilt up and down. You can’t adjust these on-the-fly, though, because everything is tensioned by screws that must be loosened with a tool, adjusted, and then re-tightened to keep the monitors in place.Build quality is poor. Vivo claims the arms can hold two monitors up to 22 pounds each, but we noticed a slight deflection downward even when attaching a 27-inch display weighing 10 pounds. Cable management is provided by plastic clips that are barely adequate to the task and tend to fall off when jostled. The clamp is small and lacks a rubber pad, so it could mark softer woods and materials.\\nWe suppose the Vivo could work if you plan to mount a couple 24-inch monitors and don’t care about adjusting them once in place, but it’s otherwise not worth $30. It’s cheap, sure — but in our experience, monitor arms this cheap tend to fall apart after a couple years (or less).\\nHumanscale M8.1\\nBest Prices Today:\\nHumanscale\\n$545\\nHumanscale is synonymous with high-end office furniture: The Freedom chair is something of an icon in executive offices across the globe. But Humanscale’s high-end office hardware is at times an awkward fit for a home office, as the M8.1 demonstrates.\\nThe Humanscale M8.1 looks similar to the M2.1, but it’s upgraded to handle monitors between 6 and 28 pounds (almost double the M2.1 in our list above). That’s enough to handle nearly any monitor available today, including large ultrawides like the Dell Ultrasharp U4025QW. The arm can also handle two monitors of the appropriate combined weight and offers a “crossbar” to support them both on a single arm.\\nThat’s good, and useful, but pricing is an obstacle. The arm starts at $545, but the crossbar (required to use two monitors) ups the price to $686. The M/Connect 3 laptop dock is also available to the M8.1 but, of course, adds even more to the price. That’s a bit hard to accept when the Ergotron HX, which supports monitors up to 42 pounds, starts at $350, or $585 for the dual-monitor crossbar version. Ergotron’s alternative feels as sturdy, supports even larger and heavier displays, and is less expensive.\\nThe Humanscale M8.1 has features you won’t find on the Ergotron, such as an optional laptop dock and customizable arm rotation, and it’s a fine selection if price is no obstacle. In most cases, though, the M8.1’s price will be hard to justify.\\nHuanuo HNDS6\\nPrice When Reviewed:\\n£59.99\\nBest Prices Today:\\nHuanuo\\n£59.99\\nHuanuo’s HNDS6 is a budget dual-monitor arm that’s popular on Amazon (in fact, it’s listed as the best-seller in Computer Monitor Arms). It provides a reasonable level of quality at a low price but fails to unseat the Workspace by Monoprice Dual Monitor Arm on our list.\\nWe’ll begin with the positives, which, to be clear, outweigh the problems. The Huanuo HNDS6 carefully walks the value tightrope to deliver a decent dual-monitor arm at a typical price of $60 (which can dip below $50 on sale). The arm’s metal construction feels rigid and looks durable.\\nEach arm is rated to hold between 4.4 and 14.3 pounds. That’s not a lot: The Workstream by Monoprice arm is rated up to 20 pounds. Still, it’s enough to handle a huge majority of 24- and 27-inch monitors, and the monitor arms provided plenty of lift in our testing.\\nWe’re not a fan of the arm’s installation. It has two clamps instead of one unified clamp, which is strange, because the base of the monitor arm is one solid piece. There are roughly a dozen screws to install. And the included cable routing can prove hard to tighten once several cables are held within the routing.\\nThe Huanuo HNDS6 is a decent dual-monitor arm for the price and worthwhile on a discount (it was once sold for just $38). In general, though, we think the Monoprice Workstream Dual Monitor Arm provides more for a similar price.\\nWhat to look for in a monitor arm\\nPurchasing a monitor arm is a bit different from purchasing most home office gear. A monitor arm, unlike a monitor, is a hefty, durable piece of equipment that never really goes obsolete. It must also support the specific functions you want out of the box, since upgrades and customization tend to be limited.\\nIf you’re still on the fence about whether a monitor arm is worth the money and the time it takes to set up, read our article that answers why a monitor arm is most definitely worth it.\\nAdjustability and range of motion\\nThe range of adjustability and motion a monitor arm can offer is a critical but often overlooked feature. A monitor arm should adjust for height, tilt, swivel, and pivot—and it should do so without tools.\\nAll the monitor arms we recommend meet this standard, but some differences remain. Only some monitor arms provide 360 degrees of swivel, meaning the neck of the monitor arm can be rotated to any position. That’s handy if your desk is in the middle of your room since you can use the monitor from various positions.\\nMost inexpensive monitor arms ditch adjustability and stick with simple tension mechanisms that are secured by a screw. It’s inexpensive but fixes the monitor’s position in place once it’s adjusted. We recommend avoiding mounts that use this strategy.\\nEase of installation and adjustment\\nNone of the monitor arms tested were difficult to install, but the difference between budget and premium models was clear. Budget models require more screws to install, and the default tension of the arm’s adjustment mechanism is less likely to be suitable out-of-the-box.\\nThe ease of adjustment varies greatly, too. All the monitor arms we surveyed require an Allen wrench to adjust tension (which is necessary if the arm seems too stiff or loose), but some were much more difficult than others. The Herman Miller Flo felt smooth and effortless, while the Workstream by Monoprice required serious torque.\\nCable management\\nProper cable management is important if you value a clean, clutter-free desk.\\nThis is one aspect of design that didn’t improve with pricing. The Herman Miller Flo’s cable management was basic, while the Workstream by Monoprice hid cables well. This did come with a trade-off, though, as the Flo’s seemed least likely to cause cables to bind while moving the monitor.\\nWhile cable management is useful, none of the monitor arms I tested can handle the full complement of cables that might be attached to a high-end USB-C monitor (like the Dell U3223QE). This is an aspect of monitor arm design that manufacturers could improve.\\nMaximum supported size and weight\\nIt’s important to buy a monitor arm that can handle the monitor you own.\\nThis won’t be a major concern if you own a 24-inch or 27-inch monitor, as most such monitors weigh 10 pounds or less. With that said, it’s wise to double-check the monitor’s weight before buying a monitor arm. Remember the monitor’s weight can exclude its stand. Larger 32-inch, 34-inch, and 49-inch monitors are more difficult to handle and may require an upgrade to a “heavy duty” monitor arm.\\nMonitor size limits should be respected as well. It might be possible to attach a 40-inch monitor to an arm meant for a 32-inch monitor. The 40-inch monitor may even come within the arm’s weight limit. A larger monitor will distribute weight differently, however, which could cause an arm’s tension mechanism to fail.\\nHow we test monitor arms\\nEvery monitor arm we recommend was personally tested first-hand at a PC World contributor’s home or the PC World office. We examine the quality, ease of installation, and range of adjustment of each arm to verify it meets the manufacturer’s claims. The monitors we use to test arms can vary over time, but generally include at least one 27-inch and one 32-inch widescreen monitor. Monitor arms rated for “heavy duty” use were tested with at least one monitor that weighs 20 pounds or more.\\nFAQ\\n1.Is a monitor arm worth it?\\nWhether a monitor arm is worth the price is subjective, but we believe our recommended monitor arms are worth making the investment. A monitor arm is easier to use than a stand, allows a wider range of adjustment, and keeps your desk clear of clutter. They’re also durable—there’s a good chance you’ll replace a monitor before the monitor arm.\\n2.Are monitor arms compatible with my monitor?\\nNearly all monitors, and nearly all monitor arms, use the VESA mounting standard. The 100x100mm bolt pattern is by far the most common, though 75x75mm is sometimes used as an alternative. All the monitor arms we recommend support both bolt patterns.\\nNot sure that your monitor supports VESA? Check the rear of the monitor. The VESA mount can be found in the center of the monitor, and the bolt pattern can be verified with a ruler or tape measure. This is likely beneath the neck of your monitor’s stand if you have one attached.\\nIt’s possible to mount a monitor that lacks a VESA mount, but you’ll need to purchase a VESA adapter. It’s a large, X-shaped device that clamps to the rear of the monitor.\\n3.Are monitor arms compatible with my desk?\\nMost monitor arms offer two mounting options: clamp and gromet.\\nA clamp mount is the most common for home office use. A U-shaped clamp fits over an edge of your desk. A screw mechanism is used to secure it. Most clamps are adjusted by hand and fit a wide range of desks. It’s important to double-check a monitor arm’s specifications if your desk is more than an inch thick, as some clamp mounts are too small to work with a thick desk surface. The clamp also requires an edge that’s free of obstructions on both the top and bottom of the desk.\\nGrommet mounts insert into the circular cut-outs found on many desks built and sold for corporate offices. A grommet mount is also a form of clamp, but size of the mechanism is different, and the mount attaches the monitor to the interior of the desk instead of an exterior edge.\\nNearly all monitor arms ship with a clamp and grommet mount, but grommet mounts are less common. It’s wise to double-check that a grommet mount is supported if that’s how you plan to mount the monitor arm.\\n4.Will a monitor arm damage my desk?\\nIt’s possible that a monitor arm’s clamp mount, if used, will cause minor damage to your desk. It may scratch the desk’s surface when mounted or removed, and over-torquing the clamp might cause a dent on some softer desks, such as those which use a veneer over particleboard. A glass desk can also prove troublesome—refer to the desk’s manufacturer to make sure it’s safe to use a monitor arm.\\n5.Do monitor arms wobble?\\nA quality monitor arm will tame minimal monitor wobble, though some might come through if the arm is mounted to a thin, light desk. Make sure to mount the monitor arm to a secure surface and adjust the arm’s tension to a level suitable for the monitor you’ve mounted.\\n6.Should I buy a $25 monitor arm on Amazon?\\nA monitor arm’s price tag can intimidate budget shoppers. Most budget monitors sell for $200 or less. Spending another $150 to $300 for a monitor arm can seem hard to justify.\\nStill, we encourage shoppers to avoid cheap monitor arms found on Amazon and other retailers. The least expensive monitor arms lack a dynamic tension mechanism, like a gas piston or spring. A few arms in the $35 to $50 range use a gas piston, but it’s often a wimpy example barely sufficient for holding a 27-inch monitor.\\nInexpensive monitor arms also lean more heavily on plastic. That’s not necessarily a problem out-of-the-box, but plastic tends to become brittle over time, which may reduce the lifespan of a monitor arm.\\nAuthor: Matthew S.

'Imagine a private person wanting to keep their private life private. Shocking'.Another argument reposted by Hudson reads: 'I see a woman who cares about her man and doesn’t want him to be screwed around by the media.''Bill looks like he wants to reach across and strangle the life out of the interviewer. I kinda wish he did,' said a third. She reshared a user on X who argued against Robert Griffin III claiming she is a 'distraction' The ex-cheerleader gatecrashed the interview to shut down a question about how they met One user responded to an article by Pro Football Talk questioning Hudson's involvement in the interview and wrote: 'Or maybe she didn’t want her or their personal relationship to be part of the interview instead on football..'I think if they don’t want to talk about they shouldn’t and if anything — your article demons why.. trying to embellish and take things out of context'.TMZ reported\\xa0that Hudson, who has dated Belichick for around three years, stormed out of the interview at one stage - delaying shooting for around 30 minutes - with CBS reporter Tony Dokoupil said to have been 'spooked' by the whole experience.The interview furthers the narrative that Hudson is playing an increasingly large role in Belichick's professional life.\\xa0According to People, Belichick's three children - whom he welcomed with ex-wife Debby - have 'hesitations' about their dad's romance with a woman almost 50 years his junior.A source is quoted as saying that Amanda, 41, Stephen, 38, and Brian, 37 are rooting for their dad despite also holding concerns.

Cupich of Chicago.Credit...Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York TimesMay 7, 2025The College of Cardinals includes 17 members from the United States. But only 10 of those are cardinal electors, meaning that they are allowed to participate in the conclave and vote for the next pope. The other seven are older than 80, the cutoff to be an elector.Six of the 10 cardinals were elevated to the position by Pope Francis and are largely known as vocal supporters of his priorities, particularly on immigration, the environment and poverty. This will be their first conclave:Cardinal Blase J. Cupich of Chicago, 76. Born in Nebraska, he was a bishop in South Dakota and an archbishop in Spokane, Wash. His appointment to Chicago in 2014 was one of Pope Francis’ early moves to reshape U.S. church leadership, particularly to show support for immigrants. Cardinal Cupich’s archdiocese covers about two million Catholics in Cook and Lake Counties.Cardinal Robert W. McElroy of Washington, 71. The former bishop of San Diego is known for regularly speaking out on behalf of migrants, women and L.G.B.T.Q. people in the church and the United States. He has said that the Trump administration’s plans for a “wider, indiscriminate, massive deportation across the country” would be “incompatible with Catholic doctrine.”Cardinal Joseph W. Tobin of Newark, 73. Before coming to Newark, he led the archdiocese of Indianapolis (where he bench-pressed 225 pounds at the gym). As a young priest, he ministered to people with AIDS in Chicago. He has said that he does not see “a compelling theological reason why the pope couldn’t name a woman cardinal.”Cardinal Wilton D. Gregory, archbishop emeritus of Washington, 77. The first African-American cardinal, he was president of the United States Catholic bishops’ conference in 2002 and pushed to pass the Dallas Charter, which instituted a zero-tolerance policy for sexual abuse of minors. Later the archbishop of Atlanta, he supported L.G.B.T.Q. Catholics and commissioned an action plan after Francis’ encyclical on the environment.Cardinal Kevin J. Farrell, prefect of the Dicastery for the Laity, the Family and Life, 77. The Irish-American was formerly bishop of Dallas. Pope Francis made him the camerlengo, or chamberlain, the Vatican’s acting administrator when a pope dies or resigns. He was responsible for verifying Pope Francis’ death.Cardinal Robert F. Prevost, prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops, 69. A Chicago-born priest, he advised the pope on bishop appointments around the world. He is also a member of the Order of Saint Augustine, a religious order of men and women who follow the teachings of the fourth-century saint. Cardinal Prevost is also seen by some as a contender for pope, though a long shot. (There has never been an American pontiff.)Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Currently, the farms are often asked to curb their output as it cannot be transported to where it is needed.John Flint, NWF chief executive, said on Thursday that upgrading the power grid was “one of the most significant barriers to decarbonising our economy”, adding that “substantial” investment was needed. He did not disclose further details of the terms.\\xa0The UK government aims to decarbonise the nation’s electricity system by 2030, a significant step towards the wider goal of cutting emissions across the economy to net zero by 2050.\\xa0In its report last year that outlined pathways towards the 2030 target, the government’s National Energy System Operator said nearly 1,000km of new cables onshore and 4,500km offshore would be required, costing roughly £60bn by 2030.\\xa0The National Wealth Fund has a mandate to support growth and tackle climate change. It was formerly known as the UK Infrastructure Bank before being rebranded by the government last October.\\xa0In a letter to the NWF in March, UK chancellor Rachel Reeves described it as a “key lever” for the government’s “clean energy mission”.\\xa0She added it should “focus its interventions where there is an undersupply of private finance” and help to “crowd-in private capital”. Investment in electricity grids is in high demand globally, although in many countries they are considered a stable investment as they are regulated monopolies.In the UK, rising network costs are still putting pressure on electricity bills despite the regulator Ofgem’s efforts to control them.

But the poll also showed Labor was in front in the seat, 51.7% to 48.3%.Guardian Australia understands that Climate 200 then showed the poll results to Labor – which had not commissioned any previous polling in Dickson, and was unaware the seat was so close – on 4 April. The party quickly conducted its own survey, which showed Dickson as a dead heat.Peter Dutton at a Salvation Army Red Shield event in Lawnton, Brisbane, in the seat of Dickson. Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAPOn 9 April, Labor’s campaign director, Paul Erickson, sent an email to supporters headed: “We’re taking on Dutton in Dickson”.“I just greenlit an additional $130,000 for Labor’s campaign in Peter Dutton’s seat of Dickson,” Erickson wrote.“Overnight, our campaign conducted new research in Dickson. It turns out Peter Dutton’s seat is closer than we originally thought. I’m sending this email to Labor’s top supporters, because as you read this, we’re working to adjust our budget in response to these findings.”The Coalition told the Courier-Mail at the time that its own polling, conducted by Freshwater Research, had Dutton comfortably in front; Dutton himself dismissed the push as a “propaganda campaign”.“The people of Dickson aren’t stupid,” he said. “The polling I’ve seen puts us in a comfortable position, I’m happy with that. You wouldn’t believe it but Labor put out a fundraising email which started this propaganda campaign. I wouldn’t fall for that.”News Corp reported this week that Coalition insiders withheld polling results from Dutton, including in Dickson. Some Liberal National party insiders dispute that the party would have conducted any significant polling in Dickson. One said: “We tried to win the election, not save the furniture”.Even as results showed big swings away from the Coalition, party faithful were still shocked to see Dutton’s seat go on election night.A ‘huge grassroots campaign’After all, Dutton had been written off in Dickson before. He wasn’t supposed to enter parliament in 2001, but defeated a shadow cabinet minister, Cheryl Kernot, in a seat that had changed hands a few times since it was first contested in 1993. As Dutton said on election night, Dickson had a “one-term curse” before he ran.Heading towards the 2010 election, Dutton held a slim margin and the polls pointed to another big Labor win. He attempted to switch to a safe seat on the Gold Coast, before the electoral tide turned and Dutton increased his margin.And he faced “the fight of his political life” in 2019 when activist group GetUp! poured millions into a ground campaign to oust him. Dutton again defied the push and held on. Labor strategists believe the GetUp! campaign, and the perception it was being funded and run from outside the electorate, probably did more harm than good.“In a state like Queensland, if people perceive that groups from other states have come to tell them what to do or how to live they will react very badly to that,” former Rudd government minster Craig Emerson told Guardian Australia at the time.The newly elected member for Dickson, Ali France of Labor, with Grace Grace, of the Queensland Labor party, at the Labor Day rally in Brisbane on Monday. Photograph: Jono Searle/AAP“That’s not an attack on GetUp, maybe 100% of their volunteers who were on the booths campaigning were Queenslanders, but if there is a perception they were outsiders, Queensland is such a parochial state that it would go down very badly.”This time round Ellie Smith, who won 12.6% of the vote, says her campaign was a grassroots one. Climate 200 gave her $319,590 starting in September, but Smith says most of the money she raised was from locals and local donations.By midway through the campaign, the Coalition appeared spooked by the independent, and began attacking Smith on local billboards.“We started with about 20 friends around a table and it grew very very quickly, the momentum was really there for change in Dickson, people were really motivated and they’d never done anything like it before,” Smith said.“We really set out to win and I think that motivated people [but] we weren’t unhappy with the result.“They saw our campaign as a major threat towards the end of the election. [The Coalition] would have spent 300k in the last three weeks attacking me personally. It really didn’t stick, it was very clear we’d done the work so people understood what I stood for as a community independent.”Dutton’s primary vote of 34.9% – down 7 percentage points – is the lowest in his two decades contesting the seat. When he won narrowly in 2007 – by about 200 votes – the Coalition primary vote was 46%. Part of the story in Dickson is that Smith ate into Dutton’s support, and that her preferences mostly flowed back to Labor.France, who had been widely tipped to beat Dutton in 2019, contested Dickson again in 2022 and brought the margin back to a tight 1.7%.France said on election day that “seven years of work” had helped her forge relationships with people in the area.“I’ve knocked on so many doors, I’ve had so many conversations. I feel like people really know who I am and what I stand for now,” she said.“[Dutton] is a massive spender on his campaign, particularly advertising. We have never been able to compete with that. But what our campaign has always been about is a huge grassroots game. It’s about door-knocking, it’s about the high visibility. It’s about being at markets.”Anthony Albanese visits a campaign office in the seat of Dickson in the suburb of Strathpine. Photograph: Asanka Ratnayake/Getty ImagesLabor sources reject any suggestion that Smith’s campaign radically changed the outcome, pointing to the fact France increased her primary vote, in addition to Smith winning a large chunk of the anti-Dutton vote.The end of a potential PMPaul Williams, an associate professor of politics and journalism at Griffith University, said Dutton’s profile as opposition leader had been “much higher” at this election than ever before. That might have hindered, rather than helped, in Dickson.“There’s no doubt that the overarching factor [for the whole election campaign] was Peter Dutton and his personality and personal style,” Williams said.Like many others, Williams had predicted Dutton would lose Dickson at past elections, only for him to hold on. He said the electorate was part of a bigger story – Queensland seats like Petrie and Forde, both won by Labor unexpectedly, had similar demographics.“These places have a higher proportion of tradies, small businesses, blue collar workers [and they’re] defying electoral gravity.“[People] were hurt by the cost-of-living crisis and yet they’ve rewarded Albo and kicked the opposition in the groin.“One view is that people liked Peter Dutton as a local member, maybe as a minister, but they didn’t want him as a potential prime minister.“[Dutton] is a difficult politician to warm to as a leader. And of course he’s come into focus much more [as opposition leader]. Local voters might not have paid much attention to who their MP was, but after 2022 [Dutton] becomes a figure of national focus and Labor was certainly saying that the more people see of Peter Dutton, the less they like him.”', 'location': 'AUS', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Dutton loses Dickson: Election campaign missteps\\nENTITIES: Peter Dutton, Ali France, Climate 200, Labor, Liberal National Party\\nEVENT: Ali France unseated Peter Dutton in Dickson, marking the first time an opposition leader has lost their seat at a federal election, attributed to a targeted Labor campaign and changing voter sentiment.\\nCONTEXT: Dutton's defeat highlights changing demographics and voter priorities.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 53046, 'sourceId': 12713, 'url': 'https://gizmodo.com/elon-musks-starlink-is-quietly-benefiting-from-tariff-negotiations-2000599325', 'title': 'Elon Musk’s Starlink Is Quietly Benefiting From Tariff Negotiations', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T20:50:54.000Z', 'content': 'Musk seems to be benefitting from the trade war squeeze.\\nThe Trump administration’s tariff regime has squeezed most Americans, causing new financial pressures as the cost of goods goes up, but at least one person seems to be making out pretty well from the situation: Elon Musk. According to a report from the Washington Post, Musk’s satellite internet company Starlink has attracted new interest from nations that are looking to wiggle their way out of Trump’s tariff crunch. The Post highlights the small nation of Lesotho, which was inexplicably subjected to a 50% tax when Trump first announced his so-called “reciprocal” penalties (which turned out to be the result of some sort of very strange, nonsensical formula that may or may not have come from a chatbot). Two weeks after the tariffs were announced, Lesotho leadership met with representatives of Starlink, which had been trying to get a foothold in the country for some time prior, and signed a deal to make the company Lesotho’s first-ever satellite internet service. Coincidences happen, of course. It’s just that, according to the Post, they’re happening pretty regularly right now with Starlink. Around the same time as the tariffs were being discussed and implemented, Starlink also struck deals to provide service in parts of Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of Congo, India, Pakistan, Somalia, and Vietnam.\\nIn the case of Lesotho, a memo obtained by the Post makes it clear that there’s an attempt to curry favor happening: “As the government of Lesotho negotiates a trade deal with the United States, it hopes that licensing Starlink demonstrates goodwill and intent to welcome U.S. businesses,” the internal State Department communication read. It’s hard to imagine that other nations haven’t had similar thoughts of strategically aligning themselves with a company run by a Trump White House employee in order to get some relief. The Trump administration has not been explicitly pushing Starlink on these companies, according to the report, but it has been encouraging countries to do business with US-based satellite internet firms, and there happens to be one very big, prominent one that comes to mind. And it certainly seems like countries are treating Starlink favorably. India, for example, reportedly sped up the approvals process for the company in an effort to grease the wheels for trade deals, per the Post.\\nLining Musk’s pockets may not be the primary purpose of the Trump admin pushing satellite internet on countries (though it surely doesn’t hurt, either). Chinese companies are quickly ramping up to offer an alternative to Starlink, and the US would prefer to capture those markets before its competitors can. So it’s using the leverage to push American products. It is funny how it seems to always benefit Trump’s backers, though, right?

That’s a little larger than the size of Rhode Island.The report, published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, arrives as nations debate whether to pursue industrial mining of the seabed for critical minerals.Some scientists argue that so little is known about the undersea world that more research on the deep seafloor is needed to responsibly move forward with extractive activities.“More information is always beneficial, so we can make more informed and better decisions,” said Katy Croff Bell, a deep ocean explorer who led the study and is the founder of the Ocean Discovery League, a nonprofit group that promotes seafloor exploration.Learning more about the deep sea is essential for understanding how climate change and human activities are affecting oceans, she said.

But for some people, bones – or rather, what’s inside them – are the best part of a meal. Bone broth, once a humble kitchen staple, has surged in popularity in recent years, championed as a superfood by celebrities and wellness influencers.\\nStars such as Salma Hayek and Gwyneth Paltrow are reported to swear by it for beauty and health, while late basketball legend Kobe Bryant used it as a pre-game meal. But bone broth is far from a new discovery – it’s rooted in prehistoric cooking, traditional Chinese medicine and folk remedies around the world.\\nSo, what exactly is bone broth – and does it live up to the hype?\\nGet your news from actual experts, straight to your inbox.

Join The Conversation for free today.\\nThis nutrient-dense liquid, also known as stock, is made by simmering animal bones and connective tissues, such as cartilage and tendons, for 12 to 48 hours. This slow cooking process extracts nutrients such as collagen, amino acids and minerals into the liquid. The result is a rich, savoury broth that can be sipped on its own or used as a base for soups, sauces and stews.\\nWhile store-bought bone broth is convenient, homemade versions offer better control over ingredients and often greater nutritional value. Typical ingredients include bones (from chicken, beef or fish), water, vinegar (to help extract minerals) and various herbs and vegetables for flavour.\\nSkin benefits\\nBone broth is praised for its collagen content – the protein that forms connective tissue in skin, cartilage, tendons and bones. It’s thought to promote joint flexibility and reduce signs of skin ageing.\\nSome studies show that hydrolysed collagen (a broken-down form that’s easier to absorb) may improve skin elasticity and hydration, and reduce wrinkles. Other research suggests it may ease joint pain and stiffness, especially in people with osteoarthritis.\\nHowever, most of these studies focus on collagen supplements and, while it’s often marketed as a collagen-rich superfood, research shows that bone broths don’t contain enough collagen to match the effects seen in clinical studies on supplements. Instead, a balanced diet rich in protein, vitamin C and healthy fats is more reliably linked to collagen production.\\nBig claims, little evidence\\nBone broth is a source of amino acids such as glutamine, glycine and arginine that are thought to support gut lining integrity and immune function. Glutamine, in particular, may help repair the intestinal wall and prevent “leaky gut” – a condition where toxins and bacteria pass through a weakened gut barrier, potentially causing inflammation.\\nSome scientists even suggest links between gut health and conditions such as autism, ADHD, depression and schizophrenia – though this remains a controversial and under-researched area.\\nBone broth is low in calories but high in protein, making it filling and potentially helpful for weight management. It’s also hydrating, providing electrolytes including sodium, potassium and magnesium that are particularly useful during illness or recovery.\\nSome evidence supports the idea that nutrients in bone broth, especially amino acids, can reduce inflammation and support immune function. But overall, there is limited human research on the direct benefits of drinking bone broth. There are, however, potential risks to consider before you add it to your diet.\\nHeavy metal\\nBecause animal bones can accumulate heavy metals such as lead, simmering them for long periods may cause these metals to leach into the broth. While studies on this are mixed, the risk may depend on the source and quality of the bones used.\\nConsuming bone broth with high levels of heavy metals can pose health risks, including minor ailments like headaches, vomiting and tiredness. But more dangerously, heavy metals can also cause organ damage in the long term.\\nResearch on toxic metals in bone broth shows mixed results. Since recipes differ, it’s hard to know the exact nutrition content of each broth. Many shop-bought bone broths contain high levels of sodium, which can raise blood pressure and strain the heart and kidneys. Check labels or make your own to control the salt content.\\nBone broth contains glutamate, a naturally occurring amino acid that may cause anxiety, restlessness or headaches in some people, though evidence for this is largely anecdotal.\\nImproper storage or preparation of bone broth can lead to bacterial contamination, which can cause gut infections and symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhoea. Always refrigerate or freeze broth promptly, then reheat it thoroughly before consumption.\\nBone broth can be a nourishing, tasty addition to your diet, especially when made at home with high-quality ingredients. It’s hydrating, packed with protein and rich in flavour. But it’s not a miracle cure, and the health benefits may be more modest than advertised.\\nIf you’re looking to boost collagen, your best bet is a healthy, balanced diet. Focus on eating plenty of protein, whole grains, fruits and vegetables – all of which provide the nutrients your body needs to naturally produce collagen.\\nIn addition to what’s on your plate, healthy lifestyle habits also play a key role. Prioritise quality sleep (seven to nine hours a night), manage stress, avoid smoking and protect your skin with sunscreen.\\nWhile bone broth may offer some benefits, the scientific evidence supporting its role in collagen production is still limited.

U.S. officials have spent the last few months talking to countries willing to take in people deported from the U.S. NPR\\'s Ximena Bustillo is here in the studio to explain. Hey there.XIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: Hey, Ari.SHAPIRO: So what\\'s the latest on this plan to send migrants to Libya?BUSTILLO: My colleague, Tom Bowman, confirmed the administration is planning to use Libya as a destination for migrants removed from the U.S., though he cautions flights haven\\'t taken off yet, and plans could change. Earlier this week, Rwanda\\'s foreign minister confirmed it was also in talks with Washington about the same issue. And of course, the U.S. has had similar deals already with Mexico and El Salvador. But now the deportations to Libya would be carried out by the U.S. military. It\\'s not clear, though, how many people or what nationalities would be sent under the deal. Tom\\'s source, who was not authorized to speak publicly, says that it would be less than a plane full. President Trump, however, told reporters he didn\\'t know about the plan.SHAPIRO: What concerns have been raised about this?BUSTILLO: I\\'d note Libya\\'s U.N.-backed government issued a statement today that expressed, quote, \"a clear rejection of this approach.\" That\\'s the government that controls Western Libya, while a military strongman controls the east. And all these countries have been floated to take in migrants from - in Africa - have notorious human rights records. Libya itself is a popular route for migrants from other parts of Africa who are trying to make it to Europe. Human rights groups condemn how these migrants have been treated in Libya.SHAPIRO: You mentioned that the U.S. has made other deals to take in migrants and is trying to make still more. Why is this a focus for the administration?BUSTILLO: You know, one of the main goals is to send migrants further away to avoid people crossing back over U.S. borders. That\\'s according to secretary of state, Marco Rubio. But there\\'s also practical considerations. About 1.4 million people in the U.S. have deportation orders, according to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. But there are many challenges to being able to remove these people and get them back to their home countries. One reason is that their home countries may not agree to accept them back, or they have limits on how many people or flights that they can take.So the Trump administration is aiming to make inroads with others to be, quote, \"third-party countries\" that can take in these deportees. These are countries that the people are not originally from, but they\\'re going to go. And these countries are willing to take them after they\\'ve been removed out of the U.S., so they\\'re a third destination for these people.SHAPIRO: Are we likely to see more legal challenges to this plan to send migrants abroad, as we have with some of Trump\\'s other immigration plans?BUSTILLO: Yeah, in fact, we have. Immigration lawyers filed an emergency motion asking a judge in Massachusetts to block removals to Libya or any third country. And they argue their clients, who are Laotian, Vietnamese and Filipino, could be sent in a matter of hours. The judge in the case already issued an injunction limiting the Homeland Security Department\\'s ability to remove migrants to these third countries. In a ruling late Wednesday, they said the order applies to any flights to Libya, too, and it doesn\\'t matter if those flights come from other agencies, including the Department of Defense.SHAPIRO: That is NPR\\'s Ximena Bustillo.

Arsenal need to sign players for the here and now to win the Premier League... so, should they sign Harry Kane?\\nAnother season without a trophy sank towards an agonising anti-climax for Arsenal in the Parc des Princes on Wednesday night, two steps short of the glittering Champions League prize they craved, a string of missed chances away from shedding the reputation of chokers and nearly-men that hangs around their necks like millstones.Of the 'magic moments' that Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta and his midfield general Declan Rice had dreamed of and hoped for and mythologised on the eve of this semi-final second leg in the City of Light, there were none.Not for Arsenal anyway. Not until it was too late. By the time Bukayo Saka, their best player, pulled a goal back 15 minutes from time, PSG had put the tie out of reach with brilliant strikes from Fabian Ruiz and Achraf Hakimi.That does not mean Arsenal did not produce a performance to be proud of in a 2-1 defeat that left them 3-1 losers on aggregate. Their players poured their hearts and souls into this tie. All of them. And they outplayed PSG for swathes of the match, too. Their pressing was super-human, in the first half, in particular.They were heartbreakingly close to getting to their first Champions League final for 19 years but until Saka's 76th minute strike, they could not convert all their possession and dominance into goals. They missed chances they had to score. They were denied by the brilliance of PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.After everything, it came down to this: PSG took their chances. Arsenal did not. Not until the game was gone. They still lack that edge that makes the difference between triumph and disaster. They do not have a ruthless goalscorer. It is the most important skill of all and Arsenal lack it. It is why they were not good enough here. Declan Rice and Co found themselves up against a more clinical opponent in PSG Thomas Partey looked devastated to be on the losing side and was embraced by Mikel Arteta PSG players partied on the pitch after securing their place in the Champions League final If anything, their failure was a failure of recruitment. Arteta spoke afterwards of how Arsenal had been the better team for 160 minutes of the two legs. Even if that were true, it means little. They had chances that could have changed the game, chances that might have shaped a different destiny. They could not take them. Moments like those decide ties like this.Even after he had pulled one back, Saka missed a golden opportunity to score again, skying Riccardo Calafiori's cross over the bar. And so the debate about whether they were undone again by the lack of a conventional centre forward will rage on. It is something they must fix in the summer.For PSG, a date with Inter Milan in Munich at the end of the month and the chance to win their first Champions League awaits. All that remains for Arsenal now is the sad, desultory crawl to the end of the season and the imperative of holding on to a place in the top five.Some, in the midst of their disappointment, will call, absurdly, for Arteta to be sacked. That would be a huge mistake. There is much to be optimistic about for next season. Saka, William Saliba, Myles Lewis-Skelly, Declan Rice and Martin Odegaard can be the core of a team that breaks its drought next season.It was said last month that this Arsenal team had come of age when they beat Real Madrid home and away in the quarter-finals and looked hugely impressive doing so. Then, when they lost the first leg of the semi-finals against PSG last week, the siren voices started singing in their ears.Maybe Madrid aren't what they used to be. Maybe the win in the Bernabeu wasn't quite as significant as it seemed. Maybe it was another false dawn. Maybe, as Wayne Rooney suggested, Arsenal were afraid of putting everything on the line to win the biggest prize of them all.That seemed to be another way of saying that PSG are a better team than Real Madrid. Luis Enrique's side has been the best side in Europe in the second half of this season. Save a wobble in the second leg of their quarter-final against Aston Villa, they have looked irresistible.After the magnificent white-knuckle ride of Inter's victory over PSG at the San Siro on Tuesday evening, Arsenal knew they needed something exceptional of their own to make it into the final. Arteta said his team needed to 'elevate' itself to a new level. Achraf Hakimi scored with a powerful effort to put PSG 3-0 ahead on aggregate Bukayo Saka's goal had given Arsenal a glimmer of hope later in the game but it proved to be a mere consolation Mikel Arteta consoled Saka at full time, with the Gunners well beaten over two legs The atmosphere was electric and it was a cauldron for the Gunners to play in Fabian scored the opener for PSG after Arsenal had enjoyed a brilliant start to the match They had nearly got the dream start they craved. Jurrien Timber dispossessed Khvicha Kvaratskhelia on the edge of the PSG box in the third minute and crossed to the back post. Rice rose above Marquinhos six yards out but directed his header agonisingly wide.A minute later, Arsenal nearly scored again. Thomas Partey, who was so sorely missed in the first leg, launched a long throw into the box and Gabriel Martinelli met it on the run and on the volley a few yards out. Either side of Donnarumma and it would have been a goal but the ball was straight at him and Donnarumma produced a fine save to keep it out.

PSG missed the cleverness of the injured Ousmane Dembele, the closest thing they have to a talisman. Arsenal laid siege to the home goal in front of the Virage Auteuil where the ultras had bounced and yelled and roared in a riot of anticipation before the match. Now they were reduced to sullen whistles as the danger Arsenal posed them became evident.PSG hardly saw the ball. They were grateful to their goalkeeper again after seven minutes. Martin Odegaard unleashed a piledriver from the edge of the box that looked like a goal from the moment it left his boot but Donnarumma flung himself to his left to turn the ball wide. It was a world class save.When PSG finally broke free, they showed just how potent their own attacking threat can be. Kvaratskhelia made the chance out of nothing, stepping inside Timber 25 yards out and curling a beautiful shot beyond David Raya but off the face of the post. That reassured the home supporters. They found new voice.PSG gradually gained a foothold in the game and when Rice was booked for a foul on Kvaratskhelia on the left side of the Arsenal box, they sensed opportunity. Arsenal failed to clear Vitinha’s free-kick properly and Fabian Ruiz controlled 20 yards out and lashed an unstoppable shot past Raya via a deflection off Saliba.‘The Champions League is decided in the boxes,’ said Arteta.\\xa0‘The result should have been very different. I am so upset and annoyed that we didn’t do it.’\\xa0 The Spaniard connected sweetly after a corner was headed into his path on the edge of the box The PSG fans generated an extraordinary atmosphere and their side led at the break Gianluigi Donnarumma came up with some exceptional saves to deny the Gunners PSG will enter the final as favourites and Luis Enrique has them fantastically set up Martin Odegaard looked dejected at full time as he was embraced by his manager Arsenal thought they had found a way back midway through the half when Saka stepped inside Nuno Mendes on the PSG left and sent a left-foot shot arrowing towards the top corner. Once again, their hearts were broken by Donnarumma, who arched his back and pulled off a fantastic finger-tip save.Arsenal escaped the blow that might have extinguished their hopes completely when PSG were awarded a penalty because a shot from Achraf Hakimi had brushed Lewis-Skelly’s hand on the way through to Raya. VAR alerted the referee to it and he gave a penalty. It was ridiculously harsh and a measure of justice was served when Vitinha’s weak spot-kick was saved by Raya.\\xa0 It\\xa0was only a brief reprieve. Dembele came on and with his first touch, he played the ball into the path of Hakimi just inside the Arsenal box and Hakimi curled it past Raya into the bottom corner.Saka’s goal, taking the ball around Donnarumma, and squeezing the ball home, was nothing more than a consolation, even if his later chance might have changed things. Arsenal were close but not close enough.\", 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: PSG defeats Arsenal, advances to final\\nENTITIES: PSG, Arsenal, Luis Enrique, Inter Milan, Fabian Ruiz, Achraf Hakimi, Bukayo Saka, Gianluigi Donnarumma, Mikel Arteta, Declan Rice\\nEVENT: PSG defeated Arsenal 2-1 (3-1 on aggregate) in the Champions League semi-final, with goals from Ruiz and Hakimi, while Saka scored a consolation goal for Arsenal.\\nCONTEXT: PSG advances to Champions League final against Inter Milan.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 53940, 'sourceId': 12816, 'url': 'https://www.foxsports.com.au/motorsport/formula-one/alpines-management-mess-laid-bare-as-doohan-team-divide-costs-boss-his-job/news-story/32ac7e6ddabd658d421d4c5aa2a049a5', 'title': 'Doohan sacking twist as F1 basketcase’s new tumult exposed — with villain at chaotic centre', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T07:11:00.000Z', 'content': 'The Alpine meat grinder continues churning.In a remarkable twist in the opening months of the French team’s 2025 campaign, team principal Oliver Oakes, appointed only last August, has resigned with immediate effect.Executive adviser Flavio Briatore will take the reins of the French-owned, British-based team.Fox Sports, available on Kayo Sports, is the only place to watch every qualifying session and race in the 2025 FIA Formula One World Championship™, LIVE in 4K with no ad-breaks during racing.

Limited time offer.The news came just before confirmation Jack Doohan has been dropped for reserve driver Franco Colapinto from the next grand prix at Imola - but only for five races.“As part of an on-going assessment of its driver line-up, the team has made the decision to rotate one of its race seats for the next five rounds of the 2025 FIA Formula One World Championship,” the team said.“BWT Alpine Formula One Team therefore announces that Franco Colapinto will be paired with Pierre Gasly from the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, ahead of a new evaluation before the British Grand Prix in July.“Jack Doohan remains an integral part of the team and will be the first-choice Reserve Driver for this period of time.”While Oakes’s departure isn’t the announcement anyone was anticipating today, perhaps in retrospect it should have been expected.It’s just the latest in a long, long line of management reshuffles.Oakes was the team’s sixth team principal in as many seasons. Briatore, assuming his responsibilities, is its seventh — that’s one team principal every 9.5 months since 2020.Renault/Alpine team principalsCyril Abiteboul: 2016 to 2020 (Renault)Davide Brivio and Marcin Budkowski: 2021Otmar Szafnauer: 2022 to mid 2023Bruno Famin: mid 2023 to mid 2024Oliver Oakes: mid 2024 to mid 2025Flavio Briatore: mid 2025 (ongoing)This list doesn’t include the myriad other senior technical and other staff to have left the organisation since its 2021 Alpine rebrand.It also doesn’t include its leaky driver roster, from which Daniel Ricciardo, Fernando Alonso and Oscar Piastri have all departed on their own volition, in all three cases blindsiding the team.READ MORE Little makes sense in Aussie’s ruthless F1 axing... but he was always doomed from the startF1 team plunges into fresh chaos as Doohan axe sparks second exit no one saw comingNor does it consider Renault shuttering its historic engine plant in France, the company’s only continuous F1 thread to have survived its comings and goings from the sport over decades.In short, Enstone has been roiling for almost a decade, lacking the crucial consistency that builds up a team from the midfield into victory contention.The search for consistency is why Flavio Briatore was brought in as part of last year’s reshuffle. Operating at a strategic level above Oakes’s day-to-day remit, the experienced and title-winning executive was supposed to steady the ship.So much for that idea.PIT TALK PODCAST: Oscar Piastri wins his fourth race in five grands prix to extend his lead atop the drivers championship, and with McLaren scoring its biggest victory yet, is there any hope for anyone else in either title chase?INTERNAL FRICTION LAID BAREIt’s impossible to see Oakes’s departure as unconnected to the rumours swirling around Alpine’s unmoored driver line-up.It’s also impossible not to see the last six months in a new light as a result.Briatore has long been known to be the driving force behind his team’s pursuit of Colapinto dating back to rumours the French squad was pursuit the Argentine shortly after he made his debut for Williams last year, just weeks after Doohan signed his full-time contract for 2025.Briatore was subsequently reportedly instrumental in securing Colapinto on loan during the off-season.That move was never about anything other than giving Colapinto a race seat sooner rather than later. Williams boss James Vowles said as much.“The best chance he has is with Alpine as far as [getting on the grid],” he revealed during the pre-season, per ESPN. “That’s why he’s there.”But Doohan has always been understood to have the confidence of the team. He was impressive in his extensive private testing campaign, and his development work last year in the simulator was highly regarded, with former team boss Bruno Famin describing him as the “unsung hero” of the team’s turnaround from its worst start of this era.He’s an extremely hard worker and dedicated team player, and his elevation to the race team was seen as well deserved.But Briatore in his big-picture role saw things differently. There were uncertainties about Doohan’s ultimate potential, and his sponsor portfolio is relatively small.Colapinto, on the other hand, is a proven scorer and has a wealth of big-money sponsors.It must also be seen in the context of Briatore’s motivation to compete in Formula 1. From his first involvement in the 1990s to his departure in disgrace in 2009 — more on that below — he’s insisted that F1 must see itself as an entertainment business first and a sport second.Colapinto’s sponsorship is about more than just dollars; it’s a new, untapped business network to be capitalised upon.It’s lucrative enough that F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali has already raised the possibility of a return to Argentina.And Colapinto is bringing a new legion of fans to the sport too. The grandstands in Miami comprised a healthy Argentine contingent that had apparently bought tickets expecting their man to have secured a seat by now.How Piastri got Max to outbreak himself | 00:57But the clash of ideas appears to have led to friction between the executive and operational management, with a distinct impression a divide between Briatore and the race team on some matters.Oakes’s hedged responses to the constant rumours about Doohan’s status at the team now take on a new light.On the one hand Oakes was representing his team’s backing of the Aussie — with himself also reportedly defensive of Doohan’s position — but on the other he had he had to defer to his executive.“I think also he [Doohan] should be given a bit of space to just get on with it for a few rounds,” he said, per ESPN, during pre-season testing.“We’re here to go racing, we want the best driver in the car, the best engine in the car.“Flavio said it, didn’t he? We’re starting the season with Jack and Pierre [Gasly], and then let’s see how it all goes.”As recently as Friday in Miami — at which point Doohan appeared to have secured his seat until at least the mid-season break — Oakes attempted to walk both sides of the street.“We’ve been pretty open as a team that that’s just noise,” he said. “Jack needs to continue doing a good job, but it’s natural that there’s always speculation there.”“As it is today, Jack is our driver along with Pierre, We’ve been pretty clear on that. We always evaluate, but today that is the case.”The Race has reported that Briatore told Doohan on Sunday night that he would be axed. Oakes’s usual post-race media session was cancelled.A team principal without decision-making power is no team principal at all.There have been long-running suspicions that Briatore was pulling the strings all along. Now it’s official.“Having reviewed the opening races of the season, we have come to the decision to put Franco in the car alongside Pierre for the next five races,” he said on Wednesday.“With the field being so closely matched this year, and with a competitive car, which the team has drastically improved in the past 12 months, we are in a position where we see the need to rotate our line-up. We also know the 2026 season will be an important one for the team and having a complete and fair assessment of the drivers this season is the right thing to do in order to maximise our ambitions next year.“We continue to support Jack at the team, as he has acted in a very professional manner in his role as a race driver so far this season. The next five races will give us an opportunity to try something different and after this time period we will assess our options.”To be fair to Briatore, he’s a proven title-winning team boss, having taken Enstone under its previous guises to multiple drivers and constructors titles. He’s not in charge for nothing.But there’s also a reason he’d been out of the sport for 15 years before reappearing as executive adviser to the Renault CEO last year before springboarding his way back into the team’s top job.Norris gets testy after Miami Grand Prix | 02:16WHO IS FLAVIO BRIATORE?The Formula 1 paddock is home to more than a few colourful characters, but Briatore’s trumps the lot of them.Born in a small Italian town but with big ambitions, his journey to Formula 1 has traversed the worlds of insurance, hospitality and fashion. He’s been convicted of fraud more than once, at which point his path diverted to the Virgin Islands to avoid extradition back to Italy.Bizarrely it was a fortuitous detour. It was during his time in the US territory that he began working for Italian fashion mogul Luciano Benetton, for whom he rapidly ascended to manage the Benetton brand’s United States operationBriatore would say in a later in interview that it was during that time, in his late 30s, that he first considered himself wealthy.But life had one more dramatic change of course in store for the controversial Italian.It started, of all places, in Adelaide in 1988. It was the first time he saw Formula 1 in the flesh.He’d never been a fan, but Benetton had recently bought the Enstone-based Toleman team and wanted someone he trusted to run its commercial operations.Briatore accepted, but before long he was running the entire team.It was the start of a successful but controversial era.Existing staff were sacked to make way for external hires only for them to be sacked too and original staff to be brought back.His most notable poaching was Michael Schumacher. The German had made his debut with the Jordan team, but Briatore ruthlessly exploited a hole in his contract after just one race to bring him to Enstone.His arrival preceded key recruits, the names of whom long-term F1 fans will find instantly recognisable: Ross Brawn, Rory Byrne and Pat Symonds.It was a super combination for what rapidly turned into a super team. Schumacher won the 1994 championship, and he and the team did the title double in 1995.But the first of those titles remains controversial, and not just because of Schumacher’s last-race crash with Damon Hill that secured him the crown, over which opinions will forever be split.Benetton was accused of cheating more than once that season. The most memorable incident was the discovery of banned launch control software in the car’s ECU. The team didn’t deny the software existed but successfully argued that there was no proof it was ever used.It was subsequently found to have illegally removed the fuel filter from its refuelling equipment to slow down the flow rate as part of an investigation to Jos Verstappen’s fuel fire at that year’s German Grand Prix. The FIA World Motor Sport Council found the team guilty but let it off without punishment.Schumacher later revealed that the controversy of that season led to him exiting his contract a year early to join Ferrari.3 in a row! Piastri dominates in Miami | 03:27CRASHGATEDespite its remarkable titles, Benetton quickly fell into decline. Much of the super team followed Schumacher to Ferrari, where they formed an unstoppable championship-winning juggernaut.Briatore was removed from his post at the end of 1997 but didn’t leave F1, and when Renault bought the team ahead of the 2000 season, the Italian was brought back as team principal.With the backing of the French manufacturer, he identified his next Schumacher: Fernando Alonso, whom he still manages to this day.Alonso was the team’s test driver in 2002 and promoted to the race team the following season, when he claimed his maiden grand prix victory.By 2005 Alonso and Renault had won both titles, and when they went back to back in 2006 it seemed certain that a dynasty was on the cards.But again the project wobbled. Renault was considering leaving the sport — the eternal story of the French giant in F1 — and Alonso left the team for an ill-fated stint at McLaren.Michelin had also withdrawn from the sport ahead of 2007, leaving Bridgestone as the sole supplier at a time competition between tyre manufacturers had been an important performance differentiator.Alonso rejoined in 2008, but by then the rot had set in, and things were getting desperate.The team had just one podium after 14 rounds when the sport arrived in Singapore for the first-ever F1 night race.It was there that Briatore and Symonds cooked up a plan to guarantee an Alonso victory that might galvanise the team and ensure Renault’s continuing involvement.Alonso’s teammate, Nelson Piquet Junior, was instructed to crash at an opportune moment of the race, after Alonso had made a pit stop, to cause a safety car, jumble the field and move the Spaniard into the lead.It worked a treat, with Alonso scoring the team’s first victory in two years.It looked suspicious at the time, but it wasn’t until Piquet Junior was sacked the following year and spilt the beans that F1’s biggest ever cheating scandal was blown open.After a lengthy and high-profile investigation Briatore was banned from motorsport for life for orchestrating the scam. Symonds was excluded for five years.A French court would later overturn the bans, ruling them illegal.Symonds returned to the sport in an engineering consultancy capacity in 2011, later working for Williams, Sky Sports and Formula 1 itself before taking up his current position consulting for Cadillac’s 2026 entry.Briatore, however, his F1 brand toxic, kept his distance.“I don’t miss it, though,” he said in an interview with the UK Times in 2019. “It’s changing and is no longer the sport I knew.“It’s become very boring, very predictable.”Now back in the sport, his return is proving anything but boring and predictable.Whether that’s to Alpine’s benefit remains to be seen.', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Alpine turmoil: Oakes resigns, Doohan replaced\\nENTITIES: Alpine, Oliver Oakes, Flavio Briatore, Jack Doohan, Franco Colapinto, Pierre Gasly\\nEVENT: Alpine team principal Oliver Oakes resigned, with Flavio Briatore taking over, and Jack Doohan was dropped for Franco Colapinto for five races; this follows internal friction regarding driver selection and team direction.\\nCONTEXT: Briatore's return and influence are shaking up Alpine's driver lineup and management, prioritizing business and sponsorship over team stability.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 49958, 'sourceId': 12561, 'url': 'https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/juliana-aiden-martinez-octavio-pisano-law-and-order-svu-exits-rcna205339', 'title': \"Juliana Aidén Martinez, Octavio Pisano Exiting 'Law & Order: SVU'\", 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T15:57:02.000Z', 'content': 'As Season 26 of “Law & Order: SVU” comes to a close, so does the time on the show for two of its cast members.Octavio Pisano and Juliana Aidén Martinez will exit the series after the current season concludes, TODAY.com can confirm.

Today, they take on the AirPods Pro and set a new benchmark for premium wireless sound (and a Gizmodo Editor’s Choice).\\nIf you were considering buying these flagship earbuds, they are hitting an all-time low price on Amazon at just $189, down from $249 and $10 below even Samsung’s own official store where they’re on sale right now at $199. This is the best deal you’ll find on the Galaxy Buds3 Pro and it is the perfect moment to upgrade your audio experience.\\nSee at Amazon\\nWhy Are They Different?\\nThe Galaxy Buds3 Pro are designed for those who look for the best in sound quality and intelligent features. Samsung has completely redesigned them and gives them a more streamlined and ergonomic shape that will provide long-lasting comfort even after hours of listening. The silver colorway and unique Blade Lights give these earbuds a futuristic aesthetic, and they also provide an element of character.\\nInside, the Buds3 Pro are powered by Samsung’s most advanced audio hardware yet: They use a dual amplifier system (a woofer and tweeter that can be controlled independently) which offers a detailed soundstage with deep bass and clear highs. The enhanced two-way speaker system features a planar tweeter (a Galaxy Buds first) which picks up on every detail in your music for a high-resolution audio experience that’s among the best in the business.\\nWhat truly sets these earbuds apart is how they use Galaxy AI: Adaptive Equalizer uses artificial intelligence to measure the fit and position of both earbuds in real time and adjusts sound output according to your unique ear shape and listening habits. That guarantees you get the best audio however you wear them. Adaptive Active Noise Cancellation is fueled by Galaxy AI and intelligently eliminates background noise and lets in helpful sounds (like voices or sirens) when you need to hear them.\\nIt’s also intelligent communication: The Buds3 Pro provide real-time translation for face-to-face conversation and calls when paired with compatible Samsung devices using Galaxy AI. That renders them a godsend for travelers and for anybody who works in multilingual environments.\\nControls are intuitive and can be personalized with pinch and swipe gestures allowing you to adjust volume, play or pause music and launch your favorite applications-all without needing to touch your phone. The earbuds are made to be tough with an IP57 rating for dust and water resistance, and the charging case provides both USB-C and wireless charging. Battery life is strong with a charge lasting up to 7 hours of playback (and 26 hours autonomy including the charging case) and additional hours tacked on by the case.\\nIn short, the Samsung Galaxy Buds3 Pro are the contender for the best wireless earbuds of 2025. Coming with an all-time low price at Amazon and some really innovative AI-powered features (not to mention incredible sound quality), you shouldn’t miss this chance since the prices and the stock may not be at this point for too long.\\nSee at Amazon', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Galaxy Buds3 Pro: Better than AirPods Pro?\\nENTITIES: Samsung, Galaxy Buds3 Pro, AirPods Pro, Amazon\\nEVENT: Samsung's Galaxy Buds3 Pro are on sale at a record low price on Amazon, offering features surpassing AirPods Pro, including AI-powered adaptive audio and real-time translation.\\nCONTEXT: Galaxy Buds3 Pro offer advanced AI features, superior sound.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 53060, 'sourceId': 12713, 'url': 'https://gizmodo.com/andor-season-2-part-3-recap-ghorman-massacre-mon-mothma-2000598891', 'title': 'Andor‘s Finest Hours Just Delivered a Huge Gut Punch', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T17:55:44.000Z', 'content': \"The crisis on Ghorman explodes in this week's act of Andor season 2, and the whole galaxy must bear witness to its horrors.\\nWhat it takes to sustain a rebellion is brought into question in this week’s episode arc of Andor, which covers what happens two years before the main events of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and the original Star Wars saga. Thematically it’s time for the rebels to figure out if they want to just fight or actually win, as tensions come to a head on Ghorman in what’s probably the most gut-wrenching watch of the series, and perhaps even Star Wars as a whole. Having this be the episodic story that dropped on Revenge of the (May) Sixth made it extra powerful and a transmitted a timeless message of resistance when needed most. © Lucasfilm Ghorman is collapsing. Cassian (Diego Luna) and Wil (Muhannad Bhaier) are sent there to finally take out Dedra Mero (Denise Gough) as the front is pushing for action against the Imperial siege. They realize that in this moment they are not in alignment: Wil thinks it’s time to fight, and Cassian asserts that just fighting won’t secure a victory sooner if they’re not ready.\\nThe rebellion on Yavin is getting there but it’s not quite ready; however, they see tensions mount on Palmo Plaza with the Ghorman front knowing the time for peace is over as mining equipment arrives on the planet. Cassian understands that Luthen’s (Stellan Skarsgård) agenda here is at work with Ghorman being poised to “burn brightly,” and that taking out Dedra is to seal her death in its aftermath to prevent her from continuing her search for him as Axis. Wil is driven to help because she’s responsible for the death of their loved ones on Ferrix. She’s just been Luthen’s persistent threat as he orchestrates the rebellion. Mon Mothma’s increased surveillance for her opposition to the Emperor has iced her out of support. People across the Senate representing their populaces are afraid as they’ve seen what’s been happening to the Ghormans. It’s simply become untenable, whether or not they agree with the Imperial narrative that the Ghor have been acting out of character as savage opponents to the Imperial presence for the once-rich metropolis of fashion houses.\\nEveryone is afraid to catch the interest of the Empire and are too scared to speak up against the clear propaganda out of the civil unrest on Palmo. Mon knows that her purpose is changing and Genevieve O’Reilly’s performance masterfully captures that shift; her people are no longer on Coruscant and are waiting for her on Yavin. And yet as Mon is still respected, she begins to ponder what to do with her last shred of dignified reputation in the Senate. Before Cassian leaves to join the Ghorman Front and take out Dedra, he and Bix enjoy the quiet life on Yavin. Seeing Diego Luna and Adria Arjona imbue their rebel couple with moments that make what they’re fighting for all the more real and pressing gives the survivors of the Imperial colonization multitudes. There’s joy throughout the “flight or fight” life that makes it all worthwhile. Seeing that is important and poignant because anyone who is seeking freedom knows what peace can feel like even if it’s fleeting, and as days get harder the hope of it staying is what would keep anyone going. As they get rest Cassian lets Bix talk him into seeing a Force healer for an injury.\\n© Lucasfilm Pretty much until now, the Force not been specifically addressed, though you could argue its presence has been felt through the actions of the heroes and villains. The healer, a Saja if I had to guess, tells them that while some people carry their past and burdens, Cassian gathers as he goes as a messenger of purpose. And knowing what we know, it’s so impactful to see Bix come to the realization of Cassian’s destiny before he can. Arjona really says so much without a word in a powerfully stirring performance. Over the course of seasons one and two, Bix has become a steadfast rebel in ways we haven’t gotten to see previously, making a wonderful addition to the heroic women of Star Wars. There’s another moment between Bix and Vel (Faye Marsay) where they’re concerned about the recklessness of Luthen’s strategies, which resulted in the loss of Cinta for Vel. Seeing them determine that this man might only see them as pawns stands in stark contrast to what Draven (Alistair Petrie) and the Yavin rebels want for them and Andor. On Yavin their roles are essential and filled with responsibility to a larger community that needs their numbers. Like Cassian, they have been courted to evolve into reliable leaders, not just Luthen’s radical operatives. The Yavin rebels, once unorganized survivors on the fringe, have survived the wildness of the planet by realizing that working together is better. They have outgrown Luthen’s extreme methodology. It makes sense they’re wary of unsanctioned activities like Cassian and Wil taking off for more spy missions that could compromise the rebellion as it draws closer to being ready.\\nOn Ghorman, Wil and Cassian see how the Empire’s presence has motivated an affluent populace into doing whatever it takes, with Luthen’s influence over Rylanz’s (Richard Sammel) peaceful demonstrations beginning to take hold. It’s the sort of exploitation from the Empire that fed Luthen’s encouragement for them to take up arms. Wil and Andor perhaps begin to realize Luthen could have orchestrated a similar outcome on Ferrix, or got the idea to set a more visible demonstration on Ghorman. By this time Syril (Kyle Soller) has a soft spot for his friends on the Ghorman front and has been attempting to divert the Empire’s attention from his comrades. He’s been seeing the unjust moves against the Ghor firsthand and it’s not what he signed up for. Soller does an incredible job at depicting a man who committed his identity to the Empire—only to have that deteriorate when he sees that he’s not there to keep the rules from breaking, since the rule makers consistently manipulate them to their liking. This makes him question his loyalty to Dedra as she assures him they’ll be going home soon.\\xa0 Meanwhile, she’s bristling at the green and young Stormtroopers arriving, recognizing the difficulty in controlling them when the time comes to provoke the Ghorman rebels.\\n© Lucasfilm Rylanz finally figures out Syril’s true reason for being present at the Ghorman front’s meetings. While Syril naively thought he was there to police them, it’s understood he was there to be an informant to keep the Empire up to date on their actions for a more nefarious reason. It was never about wrong or right, it was about working the front into reaching a breaking point that could be used against them. The civil unrest gets pushed over the edge around them as the trap works. Syril feels played by Dedra for being manipulated into treating his friends unjustly. Andor gets a moment with that hotel receptionist who had helped him earlier, who reminds him\\xa0\\xa0“Rebellions are built on hope.” As the Palmo memorial plaza is under siege, the Ghormans try to reclaim it against Imperial regiments of stormtroopers—a sight that sends Syril over the edge. Syril rushes Dedra inside the ISB building and physically attacks her for what she’s done and for making him complicit. She reveals that it was always in the plans to deliberately trap the Ghormans into having no other choice but to act so they could be violently displaced. He finds out the truth about the kalkite needed for the project he was purposefully left out on by his girlfriend. A shocked Syril tells her good luck, as he seemingly aligns himself with the fate of the people he betrayed.\\xa0 Similarly, Cassian realizes Luthen played the Ghormans into walking right into that trap to get the Empire to employ violence and excuse it as a necessary defense. The exact outcome Luthen wanted all along was to show that even the most civilized and rich of places was not safe under the Empire’s rule; they ran a smear campaign for years to get the galactic leadership to turn against them. The casualties mount on Palmo square as Stormtroopers close everyone in. Andor presses on to complete his mission to assassinate Dedra but as he prepares for the shot, Syril sees him and is overtaken by his grief at losing his purpose.\\nThanks to that early in the series run-in with Cassian, which was truly his villain origin story, Syril lost his way. He ultimately decides to save Dedra by tackling Cassian. Violence breaks loose and in that moment, you realize Syril didn’t make a breakthough, he’s still a petulant manchild with a fragile ego who isn’t being redeemed. Cassian and Syril engage in hand to hand combat at the hotel lobby bar, culminating in a powerful moment where Syril has a blaster aimed at Cassian as he asks “Who are you?” It completely deflates Syril, who had made Andor this enemy in his head, when he was just like his Ghorman friends seeking the right to exist. Even as it maybe clicks, Rylanz shoots Syril point blank in the head—he didn’t overcome his bigotry in time.\\xa0 And Dedra, who can’t find Syril, ultimately breaks down. As the KX units are unleashed, there’s more casualties in the tragic extermination of the Ghorman people. Cassian just wants to get Wil and gets saved from a KX unit they end up running over. His young friend makes the difficult decision to stay behind and asks Cassian to tell their story. He agrees to and takes the KX pieces back with him. Transmissions from the scene go out describing the atrocities being committed as people call out for help as they hide. On Coruscant, the Ghorman ambassador is arrested. Mon Mothma prepares to address the Senate and speak out against Emperor Palpatine because enough is enough. Bail Organa agrees to support her by making a speech against the Emperor at his own risk. © Lucasfilm Cassian returns, and Kleya assigns him with extracting Mon from the Senate after her speech in case immediate retaliation is planned. Andor agrees but lets her know he’s done after that, and Kleya essentially says, “Yeah, sure.” He’s provided a cover as a journalist and heads to Coruscant. Mon discovers she’s been bugged as her time is running out. She also finds out her own assistant has been planted by Luthen, leaving her feeling alone and isolated. She has no one on Coruscant anymore and her family has distanced themselves. All she has left is the family of rebels waiting for her on Yavin. When Mon delivers the speech it’s masterfully glorious; all props to Andor creator Tony Gilroy. O’Reilly shines as the rebel leader ascendant and she utterly decimates Palpatine’s narrative and pins the Empire as behind behind the Ghormsn provocation to suit their nefarious end. “The death of truth is the ultimate victory of evil” she says to the Senate as she calls Palpatine the monster who will come for them all. The ISB try to lock down the building to get Mon as their agent is taken out by Andor. Her driver calls it in as he works for ISB too. Andor gets her out and kills for her; she’s shocked, but hey that’s the price of being in the rebellion now. The edge of your seat action is one of the most thrilling and satisfying sequences in all of recent Star Wars.\\nQuickly Mon and Andor bond over not trusting Luthen anymore and get on the same page. Mon trusts Andor and the risks he takes to get her out safe. This perfectly begins to set up their relationship in Rogue One. He delivers her to Kleya who informs him that she’ll be escorted by Yavin’s Gold Squadron and will make a speech upon arrival. Fans of Star Wars: Rebels know that her ship gets intercepted and the Ghost crew step in to help her get to the rebel base safely. It’s not an obvious call out but nice to have it be canonized. Mon doesn’t know how to thank Cassian and he tells her “Make it worth it.” Andor focuses on getting Wil to Yavin for help after Kleya delivers his friend to Coruscant injured but on the mend. Upon arrival Andor gives Draven the KX pieces and lets him know he’s not running missions for Luthen anymore. Andor and Bix reunite and he reiterates that he’s done. He’s done what he can, he’s done a lot, and he just wants a life with her. She listens as he explains that wants to find someplace quiet. “The only special thing about me is luck,” he says, and he feels he’s over played his hand. He wakes up the next morning and she’s gone. She leaves him a message that delivers him to his destiny to win—with the promise to find him when he fulfills his purpose in choosing the rebellion. Captain Andor rises and K2-SO wakes up.

And sadly, the physician involved continues to believe and convince the patients and families that they have a mysterious illness,” Lang said.Marrero took issue with the study and its findings in a statement.\\xa0“I am in profound disagreement with the study conclusions and have many questions regarding the methods and the content,” he said. “I am sure that our patients, families, and communities share the same very serious concerns.”Dr. Valerie Sim, an associate professor of neurology at the University of Alberta who wasn’t involved in the study, said there has been no proof that the patients’ illnesses are related. In fact, she said, the cases are “so broad in their description that we could all have this mysterious illness.”“Sadly, the one thing that all the patients have in common is the same neurologist,” Sim said. “And the patients who have been seen by other neurologists get a diagnosis of a known entity that’s not a mystery.”James Mastrianni, a neurology professor at the University of Chicago who wasn’t part of the research, said the study reinforces that “a second opinion by an expert in the field is often helpful.”An ongoing investigation\\xa0The mystery illness theory gained traction in 2021 when Canadian health authorities began investigating cases based on Marrero’s reports. But even after the investigation determined that most patients had known conditions, some families were skeptical. In November, the premier of New Brunswick, Susan Holt, called on the province’s health minister to conduct a scientific review “into the mystery brain disease.”\\xa0“New Brunswickers deserve answers,” Holt said in a statement last year. “We need to know what’s making us sick.”Some patient advocates now believe an environmental exposure is triggering the illnesses, claiming patients’ blood and urine tests show the presence of heavy metals, pesticides and rare antibodies that warrant further study.\\xa0“It wasn’t ever about whether a patient could have an alternative diagnosis,” said Kat Lanteigne, an advocate from New Brunswick. “It was what has triggered them to have this neurodegenerative disease?”Dr. Yves Léger, New Brunswick’s chief medical officer of health, said in a statement Wednesday that the new study “doesn’t change my Office’s intention to complete its own investigation into cases of undiagnosed neurological illness in New Brunswick.”His office has received 222 reports of cases identified as part of the cluster.Marrero said he has “evaluated more than 500 patients in this cluster, and provided a significant amount of unequivocal, sometimes critical environmental exposure evidences, as well as rare autoimmune markers in many of them.”But Lang said that just because a substance is in blood or urine doesn’t mean it caused someone’s neurological symptoms.“You don’t do a shotgun approach looking for anything and everything and then finding something and claiming it’s related to what the problem is,” he said.The challenge of diagnosing neurological issues\\xa0\\xa0Neurologists with no connection to the New Brunswick cases point to a few reasons advocates, doctors and government officials are still debating the cause of the illnesses.\\xa0For one, they said, accurate diagnoses can take time. And some of the conditions detected in the study, like Alzheimer’s, can have complex presentations.“It really takes a cohesive story from the family and a timeline to understand if someone is developing dementia. There can be confusing signs on a neurologic exam,” said Dr. Kimberly O’Neill, a neurologist in the NYU Langone Health Multiple Sclerosis Comprehensive Care Center.\\xa0One of the core symptoms used to identify the New Brunswick patients was rapidly progressing dementia. But families sometimes miss early signs of neurodegeneration, making it appear that dementia came on suddenly, Mastrianni said.Once debilitating symptoms arrive, patients and their families are often desperate for answers and may be reluctant to let go of the first diagnoses they get, Sim said.“We see this all the time in medicine, that patients gravitate to a diagnosis or a group entity,” Sim said. “That’s clearly what’s happening here.”The misdiagnoses are “really a tragedy,” she added, because patients could be missing out on treatments or proper care.Aria BendixAria Bendix is the breaking health reporter for NBC News Digital.', 'location': 'CAN', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Canadian brain diseases not a mystery after all\\nENTITIES: Dr. Alier Marrero, New Brunswick, JAMA Neurology, Dr. Anthony Lang, University Health Network’s Krembil Brain Institute, Dr. Valerie Sim, University of Alberta, James Mastrianni, University of Chicago, Susan Holt, Kat Lanteigne, Dr. Yves Léger, Aria Bendix\\nEVENT: A study refutes claims of a mysterious brain disease cluster in New Brunswick, attributing cases to known conditions like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

Scientists have discovered a way to transform cow dung into cellulose, one of the world’s most widely used materials.\\xa0“Our initial question was whether it could be possible to extract the tiny fragments of cellulose present in cow manure, which is left over from the plants the animals have eaten, and fashion it into manufacturing-grade cellulose material,” said Mohan Edirisinghe, senior author of the study, in a press release.\\xa0This new study, published in the Journal of Cleaner Production, introduces a cleaner, cost-effective method to extract cellulose that could help reduce pollution, support dairy farmers, and change how we think about animal waste.Turning Poop Into ProductsCellulose, found naturally in plant cell walls, has been a cornerstone of manufacturing since the 19th century. Once used in photographic film, it’s now found in cling wrap, surgical masks, food, pharmaceuticals, and more. Unfortunately, traditional synthetic production methods often rely on toxic chemicals for extraction.The method presented in the study offers a cleaner and more sustainable alternative. Researchers created a modified form of pressurized spinning, a manufacturing technology already in use that works via pressure and rotation to spin fibres, beads, ribbons, meshes, and films from soft matter.\\xa0This new technique, known as horizontal nozzle-pressurized spinning, is more energy efficient and requires fewer high voltages than other common production techniques.\\xa0Adapting current manufacturing techniques to accommodate this new process is expected to be relatively simple. However, the research team notes that the logistics of collecting and transporting large amounts of cow manure could be a more complex challenge. But even though it may be challenging, the benefits outweigh the costs.“Dairy farm waste, such as cow manure, is a threat to the environment and humans, especially through waterway pollution, the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere when it decomposes, and the spread of pathogens. It is also often a burden on farmers to dispose of properly,” said Yanqi Dai, first author of the study from UCL Mechanical Engineering, in the press release.Read More: Poop-Derived Fruits Are Known to Grow in Sewage PlantsCircular Economy in ActionThis technological innovation is a great example of the principles of the circular economy, a model focused on reducing waste and pollution by repurposing resources. By turning a problematic waste product into a valuable manufacturing material, the technology could simultaneously alleviate the burden on dairy farmers and reduce environmental harm from waste pollution and the toxic chemicals involved in making synthetic cellulose.The global stakes for these kinds of sustainable changes are high. A 2019 study projected that animal waste production will rise by 40 percent between 2003 and 2030, reaching over five billion tons. Many farms already produce more manure than they can use as fertilizer, leading to runoff that pollutes water, damages ecosystems, and even causes human disease.\\xa0The research team behind the new technology is actively exploring partnerships with dairy farmers to scale up this technology. If successful, the approach could transform a growing environmental liability into a sustainable, manufacturing asset.Read More: Turning Cow Poop Into Energy Sounds Like a Good Idea — But Not Everyone Is on BoardArticle SourcesOur writers at Discovermagazine.com use peer-reviewed studies and high-quality sources for our articles, and our editors review for scientific accuracy and editorial standards.

Stopping to catch her breath, she reveals to Mail Sport that she recently hung up her running spikes for a very special reason.‘I’ve actually not run for the last four months because we’re having another baby in the summer,’ she says, adding, ‘I stopped because I didn’t find it comfortable anymore.’The 800m runner announced her retirement from athletics over a year ago after a career marked by stunning successes but also by serious injury. But Sharp is not planning to stop training permanently any time soon.\\xa0In fact, rather than decreasing her mileage, she has just signed up for her first ever marathon, egged on by her friend and fellow Scots athlete Eilish McColgan, who took eighth place in her marathon debut in London two weeks ago.And this despite Sharp confessing that the half marathon she ran in 2024 — her longest ever distance — ‘almost killed me’. She said: ‘The last three miles were painful. But I really enjoyed having a goal.’ Lynsey Sharp's face says at all as the magnitude of her efforts at Glasgow 2014 take hold Sharp already has a son, Max, with her fellow athlete husband Andrew Butchart Sharp flies the Saltire after her career high Commonwealth silver at Hampden in 2014 In addition to relocating to Manchester last month with her husband, Dunblane-born athlete Andrew Butchart, looking after their son and preparing for a new baby, Sharp is busy studying for a Masters in sports marketing and media, has recently qualified as a coach, and is already weighing up her next career move.\\xa0She is brimming with ideas and enthusiasm — possibilities include a job in marketing for a sports brand, the media, being an agent and coaching young athletes.Sharp is warm, engaging and refreshingly outspoken, and it is clear retirement and motherhood have done nothing to dull the fiercely competitive spirit which helped propel her to a string of impressive achievements despite more than her fair share of injuries and illness.She freely admits that though she loves her ‘incredible’ son, giving birth to him does not compare to the high of winning races. ‘A lot of people say, “when your child’s born, that’ll be the best day of your life’,’ she says, adding: ‘For me, that experience, I wouldn’t say it was the best experience.’As the daughter of athletes (her mum, Carol, competed in the 1982 Commonwealth Games, and her dad, Cameron, was an elite 200 metre sprinter), Sharp says she is often asked if she will encourage her son to get involved in sport.‘I’ve had some fantastic experiences in my career, but I also know the other side of it, like how difficult it is to make it professionally as an athlete and how unstable it is,’ she says. ‘And then also how difficult it is at 30 to then have to retire and find something new. It will be up to him.’ The running power couple revealed their previous pregnancy over social media Sharp has spent the past year working for a financial services company and though she stresses ‘it was a fantastic experience, I genuinely learned a lot about myself’, she admits that it came as something of a culture shock to go from being out on the track to sitting at a desk five days a week.Her proudest moment was winning silver at the 2014 Commonwealth Games before a home crowd in Glasgow. The race was dubbed ‘a miracle’ because Sharp had been violently ill with norovirus the night before and had been rushed to the hospital in the Commonwealth Games village. Despite a sleepless night spent vomiting, she got out of her hospital bed the next morning determined to go ahead with the race. ‘There was absolutely no way that I was going to miss it,’ she says, looking back.In the event she pulled off a sensational run, coming from behind to take second place in a nail-biting finish. ‘The power of the crowd got me through that race,’ she says. ‘It was like they were my superpower pushing me down the track.’ Two weeks later she picked up another silver medal at the European Championships in Zurich, with a time of 1:58.80. ‘2014 was like the dream year for me,’ she said.That year might have been the high point of her career, but it was against medical advice that she competed at all that season after surgery for a calf injury left her with a chronically infected wound, which was so serious Sharp was in a wheelchair and feared she might lose her foot. Despite having been laid low the night before, Sharp rejoices at the finish line in 2014 ‘Decisions like that come with experience,’ she says. ‘As an athlete, you start to know your body. And you know when you can push the boundaries and when you can’t.’Two years before that, she won silver at the European Championships in Helsinki behind Russian athlete Yelena Arzhakova. But Sharp was later declared the race winner after the Russian was suspended for two years after testing positive for a banned substance. Sharp was delighted with the win but admitted that the circumstances took the sheen off her victory.Running her personal best of 1:57.69 in the 800m at the 2016 Olympics in Rio was another highlight, though the event was again marred by controversy. Sharp came sixth in the race, which was won by Caster Semenya, the South African athlete born with differences of sexual development (DSD), who dominated her sport between 2009 and 2019.Asked after the race how she felt about competing against hyperandrogenic, or intersex, athletes, Sharp said ‘it was difficult to compete against Caster Semenya and other hyperandrogenic athletes after the rule to suppress testosterone levels was overturned.’ Sharp's European Championship silver medal in 2012 was upgraded to gold after Russia's Yelena Arzhakova was found guilty of a doping offence Francine Niyonsaba of Burundi took silver in the race and Kenya’s Margaret Wambui won bronze — all three women were born with DSD and were later revealed to have had elevated testosterone levels.There were calls from some quarters to strip the winners of their medals. But all three athletes competed within the rules in place at the time, after the International Olympic Committee took the controversial decision in 1999 to abandon compulsory gender verification, making it possible for intersex athletes to compete without testosterone suppression.Though she was far from the most outspoken athlete, Sharp found herself caught up in the media storm surrounding Semenya, who was reported as female at birth but underwent male puberty. Sharp was attacked on social media, was subjected to threats and warned never to set foot in South Africa.\\xa0Looking back on it, Sharp said, ‘It was a really difficult situation. It felt like the governing bodies could had dealt with it better.’The controversy continues. New rules were introduced in 2023 which stated that anyone who has undergone male puberty is barred from the female category, after research found that, even after taking medication to suppress their testosterone, trans women retained an advantage in strength, endurance, power and lung capacity. Sharp and Semenya exchange a frosty handshake during the 2017 World Championships In February this year, World Athletics, the governing body which oversees the sport globally, approved the introduction of a test to determine if an athlete is biologically female, due to ‘new evidence which clarifies there is already an athletically significant performance gap before the onset of puberty.’In her 2023 autobiography, Semenya criticised Sharp, whom she had been competing against since they were juniors, characterising her as a sore loser and accusing her of behaving badly. She wrote, ‘Sharp looked at me as though I was less than human.’Every time the issue is back in the spotlight, Sharp says that her name and 2016 comments are dragged up again. It’s ironic that, as a law undergraduate at Edinburgh’s Napier University, Sharp wrote her dissertation on this very subject, titled ‘Intersex Athletes in Sport: The Regulatory Framework, and the Legal Implications.’Sharp would like to put the subject behind her. ‘I don’t follow what goes on anymore. I don’t have any interest in the discussion. It’s a debate that’s going to go on for years and years to come. No one’s winning. It’s just a really complicated situation.’In 2019, Sharp took a break from athletics after surgery to remove pre-cancerous cells detected during a routine smear exam. She talks with regret about the ‘wasted years’ during Covid when she, in common with other athletes and sportspeople the world over, continued to train hard but could not compete.‘No one was able to do anything, the Olympics got postponed and sadly, as an athlete, the clock’s ticking, you’re getting older and the more little niggles and injuries I got, the more fed up I got.’ Sharp's father Cameron won a total of one gold and five bronze Commonwealth Games medals After she gave birth to her son in 2021, she returned to athletics but six months later her training was thrown off course when she got a stress fracture in her sacrum, a bone at the base of the spine, a common injury in female athletes post-partum. By the time she came back in 2023, she had missed three seasons. She raced indoors and outdoors that season but, by the end of the summer, she knew instinctively that the time had come for her to retire.Finances played a part in her decision after her sponsorship agreement with Adidas ended and she was dropped from funding by British Athletics. ‘Adidas didn’t renew my contract,’ she explains. ‘So, there was only so long that I felt like I could carry on doing it, not making any money.‘I found that I can’t pay out for childcare to do something, you know, and I’m not getting paid to do it. So, I think physically I probably could have carried on for a couple more years, but such is life.’Ultimately, she is thankful that she wasn’t forced out by injury. She adds: ‘In my athletics career, I worked so hard day in, day out, and it was amazing when you got the results, but that’s a small percentage of the amount of time that you felt you put in the work and didn’t get the results. So, the highs were great, but the lows were terrible.’Does she feel a sense of relief that some of that pressure is behind her now?‘Sometimes I miss it, and then sometimes I’m like, “oh, I’m really glad I don’t have to do that anymore, and no one’s checking how fast I’m running, or judging my performances”,’ she says. ‘But when you’ve done it for so long, you crave that. I’m very results driven, and performance focused, and it’s hard to replicate that in life outside of athletics.’ The Sharp clan - dad Cameron, mum Carol and daughters Lynsey and Carly - pictured in 1997 Athletics was never a given for Sharp. Her parents — who met at Moray House in Edinburgh when they were training to become PE teachers — never pressured her to follow in their footsteps, and always encouraged her to have a fall-back career. At Mary Erskine, a private school for girls in the Scottish capital, Sharp enjoyed playing hockey and skied at Hillend dry ski slope.It was through her older sister that she became increasingly drawn to athletics. She has always been fiercely competitive and gravitated towards athletics partly because she enjoyed it but mostly because she was good at it.She reveals that her career was almost derailed before it got started. She explained: ‘I had quite a few injuries when I started university, and I can so clearly remember walking on the beach in Rothesay with my mum.\\xa0'And I was injured at the time and missed the summer season, and I turned to her and I was like, “I don’t know if I want to do this anymore”. Within two years of that, I made my first Olympic team in London. Sharp looks back with pride on a career that had highs, lows and so many incredible memories ‘There are so many people that are lost to sport through that. But I was fortunate enough to have people on my team that encouraged me to stick at it, and it was definitely worth it.’She isn’t sure how the next few years will pan out but says she is learning not to look too far ahead. Motherhood has made her a better person, she says. ‘It forces you to slow down. As an athlete you are selfish, you put yourself first and you spend a lot of time on your own — travelling and training.\\xa0 'And you’re always like, what’s next, what do I want to achieve, where am I going? As a mum you learn to let your child enjoy what they’re doing, and just like be in the moment. It’s very different.’Laughing, she recalls a recent conversation she had with her mum, ‘Max at the moment is not great at losing. And it’s awful because that was me when I was a kid and I recently asked my mum, “when did I grow out of that?” She said, “I’m not sure you did”.’\", 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Lynsey Sharp Expecting Baby No. 2, Reflects\\nENTITIES: Lynsey Sharp, Andrew Butchart, Eilish McColgan, Commonwealth Games, Olympics\\nEVENT: Former Olympian Lynsey Sharp announces second pregnancy, reflects on athletics career after retirement, and plans marathon.\\nCONTEXT: Sharp reflects on career highs/lows, balancing motherhood/training.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 53141, 'sourceId': 12737, 'url': 'https://www.film-news.co.uk/news/UK/118320/Ferris-Bueller-s-Day-Off-in-talks-to-reunite-in-remake-of-French-comedy', 'title': 'Ferris Bueller’s Day Off in talks to reunite in remake of French comedy', 'publishDate': '2025-05-08T07:00:00.000Z', 'content': '\\'Ferris Bueller’s Day Off\\' co-stars Matthew Broderick and Alan Ruck are in talks to reunite in the comedy \\'The Best Is Yet to Come\\'.\\nThe flick has a script by Allan Loeb; the screenwriter and producer known for films such as \\'Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps\\', \\'The Switch\\', and \\'Things We Lost in the Fire\\'.\\n\\'Cool Runnings\\' helmer Jon Turteltaub is on board to direct.\\nPer Deadline, the actors will \"play best friends who, through a colossal misunderstanding that creates a ticking clock, hop in a car to find the estranged son of one of them and also try to do all the things that life has prevented them from doing.\"\\nThe film is a remake of the 2019 French comedy-drama of the same name directed by Alexandre de La Patelliere and Matthieu Delaporte.\\nLionsgate is in talks to distribute the movie.\\nAlthough the finer details are still to be finalised, the outlet claims production could begin as soon as the summer.\\nBroderick and Ruck played the titular role and Cameron Frye, respectively, in John Hughes’ 1986 teen comedy \\'Ferris Bueller’s Day Off\\', which follows Ferris Bueller, a charismatic high school senior who fakes an illness to skip school and embark on an adventurous day in Chicago with his best friend, Cameron, and his girlfriend, Sloane, including accidentally crashing his father\\'s beloved 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder through a glass window, a major turning point in his character’s arc.', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' stars reunite\\nENTITIES: Matthew Broderick, Alan Ruck, Allan Loeb, Jon Turteltaub, Alexandre de La Patelliere, Matthieu Delaporte, Lionsgate, John Hughes\\nEVENT: Matthew Broderick and Alan Ruck are in talks to reunite in 'The Best Is Yet to Come', a remake of a French comedy, about two best friends embarking on a road trip to find one's estranged son.\\nCONTEXT: Reunion of 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' stars in remake.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 53391, 'sourceId': 12762, 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/may/08/the-wrong-gods-review-absorbing-drama-tackles-dark-chapter-in-indias-history', 'title': 'The Wrong Gods review – absorbing drama tackles dark chapter in India’s history', 'publishDate': '2025-05-08T02:04:32.000Z', 'content': 'Having made his name with the hugely successful Counting and Cracking – an epic three-hour work spanning multiple generations and featuring a massive set, 16 performers and many more characters – the Sydney playwright S Shakthidharan has downsized in his latest play. The Wrong Gods covers just seven years over 100 minutes, with four actors on an almost bare stage. But do not be deceived: this is an ambitious work with big ideas on its mind. It tilts at nothing less than the history of capitalism and impacts of modernity.Our setting is riverside in a valley in India, surrounded by a bountiful forest – a kind of prelapsarian paradise. Here we meet Nirmala (Nadie Kammallaweera, the star of Counting and Cracking and its sequel, The Jungle and the Sea), a farmer and the head of her village’s council, and her precocious teen daughter, Isha (Radhika Mudaliyar, another Counting and Cracking alum), an aspiring scientist.Nirmala, whose ancestral roots in the valley stretch generations, believes in the old, pre-Hinduism gods – and in particular the goddess: the river. Isha does too, though her voracious mind is already questioning these belief systems and questing for greater truths. Isha longs to escape back to school in the city. Nirmala, newly abandoned by her husband, needs her daughter home to help work their patch of land. The two quarrel over their competing values and visions of the world, as mothers and daughters often do.A greater struggle is afoot: Nirmala is anxiously awaiting the arrival of “big fat American” developers who have greedy eyes on the village, and prays to the goddess to send them packing. Isha prays to the goddess to let her go with them, back to her teacher and educational champion, Miss Devi (Manali Datar). And then, as if teleported from another dimension, Lakshmi (Vaishnavi Suryaprakash) arrives: a middle-class smooth-talker with an offer too good to refuse – and a magic packet of seeds that promises high yields with low labour. Nirmala can prosper; Isha can go to school.Worshipping different gods: Nirmala (Nadie Kammallaweera), Isha (Radhika Mudaliyar) and Lakshmi (Vaishnavi Suryaprakash). Photograph: Brett Boardman Photography/BelvoirIf this smacks of fairytale or myth, it’s by design and clearly telegraphed by the play’s elemental set (its stone surfaces and moss-tipped concentric circles evoking an ancient amphitheatre) and by the dialogue: Isha, it is explained, is the goddess of destruction; Lakshmi is the goddess of wealth. But there may be other clues here too: in Sanskrit, Isha means strength, guardian or protector; Nirmala means virtuous.\\nSign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning\\nThe Wrong Gods is doing double duty, working as a fable of capitalism and modernity, and as a primer on a specific chapter of Indian history: the government-sponsored Green Revolution of the 1960s and 70s, and its devastating impacts. Nirmala’s village is a microcosm of a devilish pact in which an estimated 50 million farmers and Indigenous people were displaced by a network of dams that promised water for the cities, at the expense of natural environments and civilisations thousands of years in the making.At the same time, the Indian government and foreign companies induced farmers to abandon old crops and methods for new high-yield varieties of wheat and corn, and synthetic fertilisers. This also came at a cost, sending millions of farmers into crushing debt cycles that spawned suicide epidemics, and upended delicate ecosystems with far-reaching consequences.The Wrong Gods was inspired by one of the centres of this modern tragedy: the Narmada Valley, site of the Sardar Sarovar dam network – dubbed “India’s greatest planned environmental disaster”. It was also the birthplace of one of India’s most successful civil resistance movements: Narmada Bachao Andolan.Isha, Nirmala and Lakshmi look on as Devi (Manali Datar) takes the floor. Photograph: Brett Boardman Photography/BelvoirShakthidharan spent time in the valley more than a decade ago, and The Wrong Gods offers an imagined origin story for Narmada Bachao Andolan, which was substantially led by women. Perhaps in tribute to this, not only the cast and characters but almost the entire creative team of this production, which Shakthidharan co-directs with Belvoir resident Hannah Goodwin, are women.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionLike many contemporary plays of ideas, The Wrong Gods suffers occasionally from speechifying and on-the-nose lines, with scenes interrupted as characters spout exposition. The extent to which audiences tolerate this may depend on how much they know of the real-world issues.The play is generally successful, however, in bringing a massive, intractable problem down to the human scale, showing the emotions and interpersonal dynamics – and primal survival instincts – behind this epic tragedy.The performances are great and special credit goes to Kammallaweera and Mudaliyar, who swiftly and surely bring the mother and daughter to endearing life and make us believe the relationship on to which the play’s big ideas are scaffolded. Goodwin and Shakthidharan keep the drama dynamic and engaging, and pare back aesthetics and action so as to not overwhelm the text.The result is an absorbing drama – though fans of Counting and Cracking may wish Shakthidharan lent a little less on neat parable and a little more into the human mess.\\nThe Wrong Gods runs until 31 May at Belvoir St Theatre in Sydney and from 6 June to 12 July at Melbourne Theatre Company as part of the Rising festival', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Play tackles India's Green Revolution tragedy\\nENTITIES: S Shakthidharan, Nadie Kammallaweera, Radhika Mudaliyar, Vaishnavi Suryaprakash, Manali Datar, Hannah Goodwin, Narmada Bachao Andolan, Belvoir St Theatre, Melbourne Theatre Company\\nEVENT: Play 'The Wrong Gods' examines the history of capitalism and modernity through the lens of India's Green Revolution, focusing on the displacement of farmers and environmental damage caused by dams and new agricultural methods.

Of course we should consider quotas', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T06:03:33.000Z', 'content': 'The result of the federal election was shocking but it wasn’t surprising.It was a resounding message from voters – and we would be foolish not to listen.The truth is, the Liberal party didn’t lose because of campaign tactics or some leadership missteps alone. We lost because our policies failed to resonate. And they failed to resonate because, too often, they were built without the input of the very Australians we needed to win over – women, young people, multicultural communities and urban voters.Too many of our policies seemed disconnected from the daily realities of modern Australia. The cost of living, housing, secure jobs, climate and education are dominating the concerns of millions – yet when asked how we’d address them we gave voters little reason to believe we understood the scale of the problem, let alone have credible answers.To chart a credible path forward, we must return to first principles. The Liberal party was once defined by its broad reach – a party of the “forgotten people”, where aspiration met compassion and economic freedom was balanced by social responsibility. That legacy, championed by the party founder Robert Menzies, meant putting the concerns of ordinary Australians at the centre of political life.We have drifted far from that foundation. Too many Australians now see us as departed from the centre, and speaking to a narrowing segment of the population, not to them.The lack of women in our ranks is not just a political liability – it’s a structural failure. Women make up more than half the population yet remain dramatically underrepresented in our party, from branch level to the parliament itself. Of course we should be considering quotas. This is not about ticking boxes – it’s about removing entrenched barriers and making space for talent we have long overlooked. A necessary circuit breaker at a veritable crisis point where organic growth hasn’t materialised.Quotas are not foreign to the Liberal party. We already use them. Every party branch and conference must elect both a male and a female delegate to vote in Senate and upper house preselections. We have quotas for metropolitan and regional members of our state executive. We have quotas for male and female vice-presidents.The Coalition itself operates as a quota-based model: ministerial and shadow ministerial positions are shared between the Liberals and Nationals according to negotiated agreements. The leader of the Liberal party is our prime minister in government and the leader of the National party is our deputy prime minister – a power-sharing arrangement by design.But improving representation isn’t just about numbers. It’s about culture. Women should feel that they belong in the Liberal party – not as a gesture or a fix, but because their perspectives are essential to how we govern. If women don’t feel heard, valued or safe in our ranks they won’t stay – and voters will continue to turn away from us, too.The same is true for young Australians, multicultural Australians, and city dwellers. Too often they were dismissed as too hard to reach, when in fact, the message itself was the problem.Their concerns are real. They want secure work, a shot at buying a home, meaningful climate action and a system that doesn’t leave them behind. These challenges can be solved through true adherence to Liberal values. But they won’t be solved if we vacate the field.That is a recipe for disaster, where we offer no reason for frustrated Liberals to return; direct swing voters away and close the door to potential future cohorts of supporters.This election loss was not some kind of anomaly. It was a clear judgment on our relevance and resonance with the electorate. It’s not just that we didn’t win – it’s that voters didn’t see themselves reflected in our policies, our people or our priorities.Rebuilding starts with humility. It starts with broadening our base, modernising our policy agenda, and cultivating a culture that welcomes and elevates a wider range of voices. We don’t need to become a different party. We need to become a better version of the party we were meant to be.Australians are asking for leadership that is competent, compassionate and connected to their lives. If we are serious about governing again we must rebuild trust – not with slogans or short-term campaign commitments, but with substance.That work must begin now.\\nMaria Kovacic is a Liberal senator for New South Wales', 'location': 'AUS', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Liberal party needs more women, diversity\\nENTITIES: Maria Kovacic, Liberal party, Robert Menzies, Nationals\\nEVENT: Liberal party lost election due to policy failures.\\nCONTEXT: Liberal party must broaden base, modernize policies.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 47156, 'sourceId': 891, 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/business/media/dear-media-podcasts.html', 'title': 'Is Dear Media’s Podcast Network the ‘Manosphere’ for Women?', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T09:01:16.000Z', 'content': 'You have a preview view of this article while we are checking your access.

As listeners, they slightly outnumber women, too. “Brocasters” and the “manosphere” have even become a media obsession, and for good reason. During the election, conservatives successfully tapped into a world of dude-driven content to reach disengaged voters.But there has been a surge of podcasts made by women, for women, too. And a company called Dear Media is at the center of much of it.Based in Austin, Texas, Dear Media operates the largest network of podcasts for women. Its nearly 100 shows are as freewheeling and chummy as those in the “manosphere,” similarly hosted by comedians and content creators. Except here, Joe Rogan’s alpha masculinity and Logan Paul’s unabashed idiocy are swapped for girlboss confidence and therapy speak.Gone, too, is the overt conservatism that now blankets the manosphere — but not all of its ideas. Dear Media emphasizes health and wellness in its programming, at times dipping into the same kind of contrarian thinking that powers Make America Healthy Again, the agenda of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.Some of its shows are hosted by medical doctors. Others promote raw milk, parasite cleanses and communicating with angels. There is a do-your-own-research ethos, already familiar to those who follow “MAHA” or even Goop. But here, it is slid between dating diaries and reality-television recaps.This range is working. In 2024, Dear Media reached No. 7 on Apple Podcasts’ list of top channels, alongside media juggernauts like iHeart, SiriusXM and The New York Times. This year, it debuted a Khloe Kardashian show on X and acquired “The World’s First Podcast,” which inspired a hit Netflix romantic comedy. And its success could open the door for more networks to embrace women’s interest in alternative health.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Now I Respond With 4 Words\", 'publishDate': '2025-05-08T05:00:02.000Z', 'content': '“She’s beautiful. Oh, but aren’t you absolutely exhausted?” My neighbour lovingly asked as she smiled at my five-month-old daughter in her stroller. “Actually, no. I’m great,” I replied. My neighbour shot me an incredulous look like I was lying. “Oh, wow, well look at you!” It wasn’t the first time I’d experienced this kind of exchange (with a neighbour, acquaintance or even a stranger) since I had my baby. I’d heard this question daily – sometimes asked to me, other times stated as a comment. After we finished exchanging pleasantries, I was left pondering the question, and the disbelief at my seemingly unnatural response. The depiction of the emotionally and physically exhausted parent – especially the mum – is ubiquitously portrayed in our society in movies, television and across social media. Sometimes me and my husband were together with the baby, but the question of sleep still got directed my way.This stereotype is steeped in some truth. New parents are often more tired than other humans. But a study in Sage Journals in 2019 found mothers experienced more fatigue and stress than fathers. For the first few months, through newborn night feeding, I can attest to that experience. “Was I the picture of sleep health, or getting the recommended amount per night? Definitely not. But I also wasn’t miserably exhausted to the point of venting to anyone who said hello.”While my daughter spent the first month of her life in the NICU, I was back home, pumping around the clock, every three hours, and bringing it back and forth to the hospital. Most nights, I barely stayed awake to the lights and sounds of old mystery shows like Murder, She Wrote and Columbo while I pumped milk for my new daughter. Once she arrived home, I still pumped almost nonstop, but my husband relieved me of some of the responsibilities. At 11pm I’d leave him with a supply for the overnight shift. I caught up on sleep till the baby woke up at 6:30 in the morning. Was I the picture of sleep health, or getting the recommended amount per night? Definitely not. But I also wasn’t miserably exhausted to the point of venting to anyone who said hello. Different paths to parenthoodWhen I first got pregnant naturally at 37 after four months of trying, I couldn’t believe my luck. It ended tragically at 18 weeks, followed by a much earlier miscarriage during the pandemic two years later. In 2021, I finally turned to IVF, thinking it would be an easy answer. But every cycle failed. An unsuccessful embryo transfer felt like a literal death. I went through nine rounds of IVF until I had my miracle baby at 43. When my daughter finally arrived, I felt especially committed to parenthood. Joy seemed to supersede the impending stress from nonstop feeds. Even in moments of stress and fatigue, which there were plenty of, I felt completely overcome with gratitude when I looked at my baby daughter. Of course I was tired, and had moments of stress. I was a brand new parent. I also admittedly had a newborn who slept well. Early months of round-the-clock feedings turned into a baby who could mostly get through the night without waking up. But that stereotype of the worn-out, defeated newborn mum I’d seen all over Instagram wasn’t my experience thus far. Apparently it was my lack of complaining that perplexed everyone. We have new norms of achieving parenthood by methods other than spontaneous conception. Yet, our view of motherhood remains fairly one-dimensional. Our society has centred one image of what being a mother is like – which doesn’t leave much space for other stories. miodrag ignjatovic via Getty ImagesPeople who experience fertility trauma might actually build up their tolerance level for early caretaking that others (who didn’t have that extra time) may not possess.My experience isn’t uncommon. It’s simply less studied (as of now), and not as widely discussed. Plenty of research has been done on the mental distress of couples who are affected by infertility experience. Yet, studies on the difference in well-being and life satisfaction after successful IVF is, in contrast, sparse. A study in the Human Fertility Journal found that couples who had babies through IVF were often more positive and happier than those who conceived naturally. Some reasons hypothesised were the extra support that couples who go through IVF receive and a greater level of satisfaction after trying for a long time.Last fall, the Netflix movie Joy told the story of the pioneers of IVF in the 1970s and the first IVF baby, Louise Joy Brown. The film’s creator, Rachel Mason, drew inspiration from her own infertility story. Mason did IVF seven times before having her son, and said in an interview while promoting the movie, “subconsciously, when you’ve fought for it, I think you enjoy it more”.When I interviewed Robyn Koslowitz, Ph.D., a psychologist and parenting educator, for this story, she explained, “our suffering points us to the preferred life we’d like to have. It ultimately clarifies our values and priorities”. Her upcoming book Post-Traumatic Parenting: Break the Cycle and Become the Parent You Always Wanted to Be describes the ways trauma can work as a superpower. Fertility trauma can build up a tolerance level for early caretaking that others who didn’t have that extra time may not possess. My struggles with fertility prepared me in advance for many of the challenges of parenting. The six years I had to work on myself taught me resilience and instilled a fortitude in me that gave me new confidence. That sense of accomplishment and knowing I could do difficult things would serve as a useful tool while raising my daughter. “My struggles with fertility prepared me in advance for many of the challenges of parenting. The six years I had to work on myself taught me resilience and instilled a fortitude in me that gave me new confidence.”“It makes navigating the hard stuff a little easier, because you know you’ve done it once before,” Koslowitz told me. “If what you went through makes you less afraid as a result, that’s a superpower.” A 2024 Norwegian study – the largest to date comparing trends in parents who conceived through ART (Assisted Reproductive Technology) versus naturally – found that having a baby via IVF was associated with lower levels of anxiety and depression. It illustrates that the negative emotions endured in infertility don’t always continue into pregnancy or parenthood. An important aspect of these increased feelings of positivity is overwhelming gratitude. That dark period of wanting to be a mum has passed. But deep within me lies the knowledge that this could easily also not have happened. A lot of IVF is simply luck (though influencers may not want people to believe that). That understanding is why I’ll never take my parental status for granted. Finding joy in even the stressful moments of mothering isn’t about perpetuating toxic positivity, or implying others are ungrateful. It’s about owning my own gratitude and leading with it – even in moments of stress – like baby’s sleep schedules. Michelle Bias, a trauma expert with a master’s degree in transpersonal psychology, said my grief and gratitude are linked. She defined this as a “deep reverence for the gift of life”.“Our past fully feeds into our experience as mothers. It’s a life force pushing us forward, and what we learned systematically impacts how we parent.”‘Motherhood is not one-size-fits-all’Everyone seemed to want me to wear my new title of mother like a badge of honour, as if not admitting to exhaustion meant I wasn’t doing something right. Being overwhelmed was what people understood. “We fit mothers into familiar roles we see them play, and the societal expectations, like exhaustion – which we put solely on them – perpetuate these cultural narratives,” said Bias. “The world isn’t ready to leave room for different maternal experiences. The reply of your positive experience reframed it in a way people weren’t used to hearing, and left them unsure how to express themselves. We need to realise that motherhood is not one-size-fits-all.” Now when I’m asked formulaic questions – which I get less with an 11-month-old, but still hear frequently – I’ve learned how to shift the conversation. Koslowitz defined it as a “one-liner response that honours my experience, without pushing myself into the box that’s been presented to me.” Similarly, Bias suggested asking a question in return. For now, when people ask me if I’m sleeping, I respond with four words: I’m enjoying the journey.', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: IVF parents find joy, gratitude in motherhood\\nENTITIES: Robyn Koslowitz, Michelle Bias, Rachel Mason, Louise Joy Brown\\nEVENT: Author shares her experience with IVF and motherhood, finding joy despite challenges.\\nCONTEXT: IVF parents may experience more gratitude, less exhaustion.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 53518, 'sourceId': 12771, 'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c30q09638n8o', 'title': 'Kashmir: Why India and Pakistan fight over it', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T14:52:07.000Z', 'content': '23 hours agoReutersKashmir has been a source of conflict between India and Pakistan for decadesNuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan have fought two wars and a limited conflict over Kashmir. But why do they dispute the territory - and how did it start?What we know about India\\'s strike on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered KashmirIndian air strikes - how will Pakistan respond? Four key questionsLIVE: Tensions escalate as Pakistan vows response to Indian strikes after Pahalgam killingsHow old is this conflict?Kashmir is an ethnically diverse Himalayan region famed for the beauty of its lakes, meadows and snow-capped mountains.Even before India and Pakistan won their independence from Britain in August 1947, the area was hotly contested.Under the partition plan provided by the Indian Independence Act, Muslim-majority Kashmir was free to accede to either India or Pakistan.The maharaja (local ruler), Hari Singh, initially wanted Kashmir to become independent - but in October 1947 chose to join India, in return for its help against an invasion of tribesmen from Pakistan.Kashmir profile - TimelineA war erupted and India asked the United Nations to intervene. The UN recommended holding a plebiscite to settle the question of whether the state would join India or Pakistan. However, the two countries could not agree to a deal to demilitarise the region before the referendum could be held.In July 1949, India and Pakistan signed an agreement to establish a ceasefire line as recommended by the UN and the region became divided.AFPKashmir is known by some as India\\'s Switzerland, due to its verdant fields and sweeping mountainscapesA second war followed in 1965. Then in 1999, India fought a brief but bitter conflict with Pakistani-backed forces.By that time, India and Pakistan were declared nuclear powers. Today, Delhi and Islamabad both claim Kashmir in full, but control only parts of it.Why has there been so much unrest in the Indian-administered part?Within Indian-administered Kashmir, opinions about the territory\\'s rightful allegiance are diverse and strongly held.

Google's iOS app has a new solution if you come across a scientific paper or an article written by someone a little too fond of being obtuse. The new Simplify feature for Google's mobile app rewrites any jargon-filled internet text into language that doesn't require a specialty dictionary, and without leaving the app.To use Simplify, you'll need to browse the web from the Google app. When you hit a wall of needlessly complicated text, you can highlight it, and a little Simplify button will appear. Tapping the button will rework that highlighted paragraph into something far more comprehensible to the average person.Simplify is essentially a shortcut for Google's Gemini AI. Google Research designed a prompt-optimization process that asks Gemini to transform the text into something easier to understand behind the scenes, activating when you tap the Simplify button.The Simplify button won't utterly change your life or redefine how you engage with content online, but it could cut down on the need for new tabs or at least remove the need to copy and paste opaque text into Gemini or ChatGPT every time you run up against a linguistic roadblock.Simple AIAccording to the developers of the Simplify tool, the AI translation not only made dense content easier to parse, but it also helped them remember what they read. It's of a piece with other AI tools rolled out by Google to streamline tedious or annoying bits of people's experiences online.It matches neatly with features like Google Gemini widgets or the anticipated Power Up button for improving your prompts. The Simplify feature also falls under the AI enhancement of the browsing experience that Google has deployed (with occasional pratfalls), like the Search Generative Experience and AI Overviews for Search. Simplify feels more directly pitched to individuals, though, since you have to choose to use it.For now, Simplify is iOS-only, and it's not going to be perfect every time. Like any AI tool, it might make a mistake or oversimplify its response and lose some of the nuance found in the original text. That's a tradeoff common to any translation, however. It may also be a tradeoff most users will be happy to make, especially when the alternative is drowning in multisyllabic nonsense about blockchain governance protocols.Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.You might also likeYou can put Google Gemini right on your smartphone home screen – here’s howOne of my favorite AI tools is getting an iPhone app, and here's why you should install itGoogle Gemini could soon get a super-useful 'Power up' button – here's what it does\\nEric Hal Schwartz is a freelance writer for TechRadar with more than 15 years of experience covering the intersection of the world and technology.

Legislation that won final approval Wednesday would halt the capital gains tax this year for individuals and could eventually eliminate it for corporations, if state revenues keep growing. The tax repeal now heads to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has said he\\'s “very supportive” of it. Though proponents hope it can spur the economy, detractors assert that the capital gains tax repeal will primarily benefit the rich and result in less tax revenue for public schools and services. The Republican-led Legislature overcame objections by Democrats only after expanding the bill with greater tax breaks for seniors and disabled residents and new sales tax exemptions for diapers and feminine hygiene products.Missouri\\'s unique income tax carve-out comes as Republican-led legislatures in at least eight other states have passed more traditional income tax rate reductions this year. It also comes as Congress weighs whether to renew and expand income tax breaks enacted during President Donald Trump\\'s first term in office.Capital gains are profits from the sale of assets such as stocks, cryptocurrency or property. The federal government taxes long-term capital gains, on assets held for more than a year, at a lower rate than ordinary income. All states that tax income also tax capital gains. Missouri currently is among 32 states and the District of Columbia that tax capital gains at the same rate as wages and other income, according to the nonprofit Tax Foundation. Eight states tax capital gains at a lower rate than other income. Some Democratic-led states have been moving in the opposite direction. Maryland lawmakers last month passed a bill that would impose a 2% capital gains tax on those with incomes over $350,000. And Washington lawmakers recently passed legislation to impose an extra 2.9% tax on capital gains over $1 million. Minnesota already imposes a surcharge on capital gains and other investment income over $1 million. Proponents of axing the capital gains tax say the tax discourages investment and incentivizes people to hold onto assets instead of selling them and spending money elsewhere in the economy. “When you tax something you get less of it,\" said Jonathan Williams, president and chief economist at the American Legislative Exchange Council, an association of conservative lawmakers and businesses. \"The idea is, of course, you want more investment in your state.”Though ALEC has long backed the repeal of state capital gains taxes, Missouri House Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins said the idea came to him last year from friends at an employee-owned construction company that was getting hit with the tax. He said his legislation also could benefit family farmers who want to sell their land. The capital gains tax results in \"lost economic opportunity, financial sclerosis, lower wages -- all of which serve to make Missouri less competitive both domestically and internationally,” said Republican state Sen. Curtis Trent, who handled the bill in the Senate. Opponents say the wealthy will get the greatest reward. Repealing Missouri\\'s tax on capital gains would set “a worrisome precedent” nationally and “worsen economic and racial inequities,” said Sam Waxman, deputy director of state policy research at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. One government study found that white families are more likely to report capital gains than some minorities. Among middle-income taxpayers, about 8% of white families benefited from the federal government\\'s tax rates on capital gains and dividends compared to just 3% of Black families and 1% of Hispanic families, according to a 2023 U.S. Treasury Department report. In Missouri, about 542,000 individual income taxpayers reported capital gains in 2022, amounting to just one-fifth of all filers, according to the Missouri Budget Project, a nonprofit research group that opposes the capital gains tax repeal. The group estimates that 80% of the tax relief would go to the wealthiest 5% of taxpayers.Legislative researchers estimate Missouri\\'s capital gains tax repeal could cost the state about $262 million annually when fully implemented. But that\\'s disputed by both supporters and opponents. The Missouri Budget Project estimates the cost could be nearly $600 million annually. Trent predicts the tax repeal will trigger “increased economic growth (that) will translate into increased tax revenue\" over time. Owen Zidar, an economics and public affairs professor at Princeton University, studied the impacts of 584 capital gains tax rate changes in states over four decades. Capital gains tax cuts tend to result in more people selling assets for gains, but not so much as to offset the lost tax revenue, he said. Zidar said he is skeptical of claims that Missouri\\'s capital gains tax repeal will attract a lot of investment and economic activity.“I think it’s going to be a substantial revenue decrease,” he said.', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Missouri poised to eliminate capital gains tax\\nENTITIES: Missouri, Mike Kehoe, Donald Trump, Jonathan Williams, Chad Perkins, Curtis Trent, Sam Waxman, Owen Zidar\\nEVENT: Missouri legislature approved a bill to halt capital gains tax for individuals and potentially corporations, awaiting governor's approval.

Moses is arguably the second-best halfback in the game behind Cleary and led NSW to a series win last year, but he did share the spoils with Luai, who has also enjoyed a strong start to 2025 at his new club. However, if Moses can star in a win over a talented Dolphins side to kick off Round 10, that would make NSW coach Laurie Daley’s decision much more easier.Moses’ club coach Jason Ryles didn’t want to comment on his halfback’s chances of being picked for the Blues. It’s fair enough, as the first year coach is trying to figure out how to turn the fortunes of the last-placed Eels around.“In my thought process is how we play every week here. Having experienced it myself, if you get your footy right here, then Origin looks after itself,” Ryles said.“First and foremost, we’ll get our footy right. If whoever does happen to get selected, then that’s a bonus.. “I think there’s enough pressure and commentary on the Origin stuff. I’ve been in it as a player and have watched on from the outside.“We’re aware of the influence Mitch has on our footy team.”Dolphins’ burning question: Can the Dolphins improve on their horror record outside of QLD?The Dolphins have had next to no success outside of their home state since entering the comp at the start of 2023, winning only three games outside of QLD.Coach Kristian Woolf admits he doesn’t have the silver bullet to fix it, but said that he has altered with the team’s preparation for the interstate games and hopefully that will yield results. “It’s been an issue for us over the first 2.5 years to be fair. I think we’ve only won three games outside of Queensland so it’s something we need to be a little bit better at,” Woolf said.“We’ve raised it previously with the group and it’s something we’ve tried to tinker with our preparation to accommodate it as well. “If I had the answer we’d have fixed it. It’s probably a number of things but as I said, we’ve made a couple of little adjustments and I’d like to think it will help us.”MORE NRL NEWSBLOG WITH HOOPS: Origin battle settled; unsung hero behind Moneyball riseTALKING POINTS: Madge’s Broncos make no sense; Origin bid verdict on ‘destroyer’‘FORTUNATE’: Ricky’s rare Bunker call after huge play rubbed out in golden point Mitchell and Humphreys return for Bunnie | 01:29FRIDAY MAY 9Newcastle Knights vs Gold Coast Titans at McDonald Jones Stadium, 6:00pm AESTKnights’ burning question: Can Newcastle prove last weekend’s offensive output was no fluke?Entering Magic Round, the Knights had averaged just 10 points a game, so 24 points in the first half against the Rabbitohs was not what anyone envisaged.Newcastle’s attack roared back to life on the Suncorp Stadium turf, with impressive young gun Fletcher Sharpe scoring a hat-trick and superstar fullback Kalyn Ponga returning to form. Not only was it the win the Knights needed to get their season back on track, but they finally showed how dangerous a team they can be when everything clicks in attack as they are already very stout defensively. One swallow doesn’t make a summer and it was against a decimated Souths side, but there were good signs that Adam O’Brien’s men can build on.Next up is a tantalising match up against the Gold Coast, who are the second-worst defensive team in the league. Titans’ burning question: Will the Titans overcome the Fifita distraction and finally put an end to a horror streak?It’s been 41 days since the Gold Coast Titans have last tasted victory. That was March 28 when they upset the Roosters in Sydney. At that point of the season, the Titans were sitting pretty in the top eight after two convincing wins. That seems like an age ago now. Since, the Titans have lost five straight games and are now on the verge of losing one of their best players in David Fifita. Fifita was dropped for Magic Round due to a disagreement with coach Des Hasler and has now been shut down indefinitely amid reports he’s been shopped around to rival clubs. Having Fifita in the line up no doubt makes this team better, but it’s fair to say his form has been hot-and-cold at best in 2025. The thing is, the Titans have so much talent across the park and simply should not be in the midst of a five-game losing streak whether Fifita is on the park or not. What might be of some relief and give this playing group some much-needed confidence is an upcoming date with the Knights. The Titans match up well against the Knights, having thrashed them earlier in the season (without Fifita).

Remarkably, they’re 4-1 when Humphreys is wearing the No. 7.It’ll be no easy task against a Broncos side that will be hungry off a heavy loss, but with Humphreys back on deck, at least Souths are settled at the most important position. Broncos’ burning question: Can the Broncos find consistency as Ezra Mam return looms?The Broncos’ Jekyll and Hyde season continued with a confounding 32-8 loss to the last placed Panthers a week after thrashing the top of the table Bulldogs. Michael Maguire’s side can’t seem to string strong performances together and have lost three of their last four and they could be set for more growing pains with Ezra Mam returning in the next couple of weeks. Johns believes the Broncos looked tired in their Magic Round loss to the Panthers. “The Broncos were such a strange game to watch because at the start they poured so much energy into their defence and they were all over the Panthers,” Johns said on Matty and Cronk. “I tell you what was unusual about the Broncos was they fatigued really quickly. They coughed up a lot of ball and made a lot of errors, but I thought halfway through the first half, I thought some of the forwards are starting to struggle here.“The last 20 minutes of the game, the forwards were so out on their foot that Penrith could just do whatever they wanted.” Cooper Cronk believes the Broncos need to get their defence right on their edges. “Defensively we saw some poor decisions when Cleary was playing straight, Kotoni Staggs was just getting caught out of position,” Cronk said. While Mam was predicted to return at five-eighth, with Hunt switching to hooker, Johns believes he should come back via the bench. “I think when he comes in at No.14 he will give Madge a lot of mid-game flexibility,” Johns said of Mam.“Put him at No.14 then you can move him to No.6 and put Hunt to No.9.” Cronk believes Mam’s return could bring the best out of Hunt, who has struggled for consistency this season like the team. “I think you might get a reaction out of Ben Hunt as well, if he sees that Ezra is there, his level of performance will go through the roof,” Cronk said. Ben Hunt could be moved amid Ezra Mam’s looming return.Source: Getty ImagesSATURDAY MAY 10Canberra Raiders vs Canterbury Bulldogs at GIO Stadium, 3.00pm AESTRaiders’ burning question: Are the Raiders losing their most important player in title charge?The Raiders have stunned the NRL this season and can go equal top of the table with a win over the ladder leading Bulldogs in Round 10. But could their title window open and close in the same season with their halfback Jamal Fogarty moving to the Sea Eagles next season? Johns believes the Ricky Stuart is in the midst of his finest hour as an NRL coach. “I think this year is just about his finest coaching performance,” Johns said. However, Cronk believes the key to the success of the team might be the play of Fogarty, who will leave at season’s end. “What I love about what Ricky and the Raiders are doing is they have this strong, experienced forward pack that have been doing these things for the last couple of years with Tapine, Papalii and Horsburgh has gone to another level this year,” Cronk said. “But these young outside backs have really taken their game to another level and I think the key to it and I know he’s leaving is Jamal Fogarty’s kicking game and decision making. “He doesn’t over play his hand ever, but he keeps that team on track. It is good halfback play for an older guy who probably doesn’t have the speed and the footwork to break open a line, like Metcalf or Cleary, but he is doing a lot of work behind the scenes to keep that operation humming.” Johns agreed that Fogarty has had an effect at the Raiders like Adam Reynolds at the Broncos, which makes the Titans decision to move him on all the more confounding. “Fogarty binds everything together,” Johns said. “It is a bit like Adam Reynolds before he arrived at the Broncos they had all this talent, but had no one to bind it all together.” Jamal Fogarty holds the key to the Raiders’ stunning season.Source: Getty ImagesBulldogs’ burning question: Can the Bulldogs compete with the Raiders’ forward pack?The Bulldogs bounced back into form with a 38-18 win over the Titans off the back of their loss to the Broncos. However, their only loss this season came against a big powerful forward pack and they will again face just that in a top of the table clash with the Raiders in Round 10. Johns believes the loss of Jacob Preston to a four-game suspension after his failed judiciary challenge could be a massive factor against the Raiders. “They are missing some key men and they are losing Jacob Preston for this week,” Johns said. “Their attack has been the best, but Ciraldo would be disappointed by conceding 18 points against an understrength Titans team.” Cronk believes the Bulldogs face a huge challenge to handle the Raiders’ front row and their backline defence led by Stephen Crichton will face one of their biggest tests against Canberra. “I think the Bulldogs defence through the middle needs to stop Tapine and Papalii,” Cronk said. “Starling has been very good off the back of those guys’ momentum. But Crichton is the best defensive centre in the game.” Roosters open door for early Young exit | 00:33St George Illawarra Dragons vs New Zealand Warriors at WIN Stadium, 5:30pm AESTDragons’ burning question: How much of an impact will exciting young gun Loko Jnr Pasifiki Tonga have on debut?The Dragons will unleash the 19-year-old forward at WIN Stadium on Saturday, hoping he can provide a spark for the Red V, who have lost two straight games. It’s been an up-and-down year for the Dragons, who entered this season with concerns over their forward pack.While the likes of Toby Couchman and Jaydn Su’A have played well, there hasn’t been enough input consistently from the rest of the forwards.Pasifiki Tonga isn’t going to be expected to be the answer on debut, but Shane Flanagan hopes he can add some much needed punch.Last week against the Tigers, only one Dragons forward ran for over 100 metres (Su’A).Against a talented Warriors pack, that output won’t do. Pasifiki Tonga is looking forward to the challenge NRL footy brings, and he’s not overthinking things ahead of his maiden first grade match.“I just want to play my game, stay in the moment, stay calm,” he told the SMH.“My footy is simple – just run hard and everything will fall into place. We have a saying that [teammate] Ben Murdoch-Masila says – just run hard, tackle hard.“That’s what I try to do.”Warriors’ burning question: Can Luke Metcalf make the Warriors a threat for a maiden title?The Warriors weren’t picked by many experts to make the top eight, but they are entrenched in the top four and a smoky for a drought-breaking maiden title. Granted the Warriors have had a slightly softer draw to start the year, but you can only beat who is in front of you and Metcalf has his team singing from the same hymn sheet. Johns marvelled at Metcalf’s ability to talk the talk and then walk the walk in his bid to replace club legend Shaun Johnson in the No.7 jersey. “Metcalf geez he is playing good football,” Johns said. “What he is doing at the moment you can’t underestimate how difficult it is because he is organising the side, he is owning the side and he is running the side. “But he’s not losing that individuality that made him such a good player.“He went to Andrew Webster in the off-season and said, I want to run this team.” Cronk believes Metcalf has built his game on his defence and managing his teammates and his running game and brilliance in attack is just feeding off that foundation. “For a guy after nine rounds and with the inexperience of the No.7 jersey, he has got the Warriors in the palm of his hand and I’m not just talking the team, but the fans and everything going with him,” Cronk said. “As a young half when you are trying to put your fingerprints on a football team, there is probably two ways you need to do it. “One is your defence. You have got to gain the respect of your teammates in defence. And the other one is communication and leading the team around the field and he is doing both of them. “And we haven’t even spoken about his skill and running and passing game. They are the things that a half gains respect from the rest of the team.” North Queensland Cowboys vs Penrith Panthers at Queensland Country Bank Stadium, 7:35pm AESTCowboys’ burning question: Can the Cowboys arrest the trend of poor starts in games?Having won four and lost four, the Cowboys sit just outside of the eight.A solid effort with a third of the season in the books, no doubt. But it really could look much better if they had helped themselves early in the contest. In Magic Round, the Cowboys trailed 28-12 to the Warriors before leaving it too late in a 30-26 loss.In fact, in six of eight games this season, the Cowboys have trailed at half time. Remarkably, in all eight games, North Queensland have been trailing after 25 minutes.Fullback Scott Drinkwater thinks he knows why the Cowboys are slow to move and hopes they’ll be able to rectify it this week against the team who has won the past four titles.“I just think when we don’t have momentum at the start of the game or lose momentum, we’re giving away cheap possession with a few penalties or six agains and that’s leading to tries too easily,” Drinkwater said.“I think we just need a bit more grit and fight when we we don’t have momentum at the start of the game so we can hang in there.“Once we start going after the game, I feel like we can get on top of teams pretty easily and quickly and we’ve shown that but maybe we need a bit more fight when we don’t have momentum.”Panthers’ burning question: Can Cleary do the unthinkable and lead the Panthers back to the finals?After being in dead last after eight rounds, many were prepared to write the Panthers finals chances off, but a stunning 32-8 win over the Broncos has them just two wins outside the top eight. Nathan Cleary was mesmerising against Brisbane and Johns believes the key to his game was playing straight and creating opportunities and space for his outside men. “I’ve rarely seen him play so straight, there was a marked change in his football and it just worked so well,” Johns said. “He just kept peeling the Broncos short, particularly on the left-hand side and made a big difference to their attack.“It gave Blaize that little bit more room and it allowed them to simplify their football.” Cronk believes the key to unlocking the Panthers attack is Cleary playing straight through the middle, before shifting the ball to his fast men out wide. “When we talk about playing North-South, the whole idea of that is the more direct you can play in the middle of the field, is the centre metre or the metre that the outside players need,” Cronk said. “I always talk about, if you think you are playing square, you are actually not square enough, so over-exaggerate that squareness on game day actually sets you a straighter compass. “He was gun barrel straight and down the left side it was the difference between scoring tries and not.” Will DCE halt Roosters development? | 04:17SUNDAY MAY 11Melbourne Storm vs Wests Tigers at AAMI Park, 2:00pm AESTStorm’ burning question: Can the Storm fill the void left by Harry Grant?The Storm looked like they were cruising to a title this season before an injury to their captain Harry Grant threw their revenge season off the rails. The Storm have now lost two of their last three and are in danger of slipping out of the top four against the in form Tigers. Johns believes the importance of Grant to the Storm machine can’t be over-estimated. “About a month ago we were saying it was the Storm’s competition, but in the absence of Harry Grant we are seeing how critical he is to that side,” Johns said. “He is vital to that fast middle field football they like to play. The last three weeks without Harry there they have dropped considerably.”Cronk explained how the absence of Grant allows defences to focus their pressure on the Storm halves, which cuts down their space and makes Melbourne more predictable in attack. “Defences when they are not coming up against Harry just put their eyes on Munster and Hughes, so they don’t have too much of a concern around the middle of the ruck,” Cronk said. “They will make their tackles, but as soon as that pass goes out, they push to put pressure on Munster and Hughes.“When the defence takes their eyes off Munster and Hughes, the one person that takes advantage of that is Grant. They pass, pass, pass wide and then there will be Grant and Papenhuyzen back through the middle at some stage.“So there is a real opportunity to play both with width and straighten up, but when Grant’s not there they struggle to straighten up.”Tigers’ burning question: Can Galvin and Luai put issues aside to lead the Tigers back to the finals?After three straight wooden spoons, the Tigers are now back in the top eight and have won three of their last four games despite the Lachlan Galvin saga threatening to derail their season. While Galvin might not be a part of the club’s future beyond 2026 and he is reportedly not tight with Tigers skipper Jarome Luai off the field, that doesn’t mean the pair can’t make it work on it. Johns believes Luai summed it up after the Tigers’ 34-28 win over the Dragons. “Galvin and Luai are forming a really good combination and Luai came out after the game and said, you don’t have to be great mates to win,” Johns said. Cronk agreed with Luai, but challenged the Tigers playmakers to keep building their partnership on the field because he believes it holds the key to the Tigers playing finals or not. “To Luai’s point, Benji is in this position where he is coming off three wooden spoons and there are signs of improvement with the Tigers,” Cronk said. “So to Luai’s point they have to play together because if you don’t you are probably going to lose a few more games than you probably would win.“The whole idea for the Tigers and Benji is improvement, so I don’t mind that Luai said that. They need to gel and perform well. They need to find a way to work together, but ultimately it is all about performance.“If you play well no one is going to ask questions, but if you lose games and there is frustration that comes into play I guarantee there will be questions asked.”Tigers take out try-fest against Dragons | 02:28Manly Sea Eagles vs Cronulla Sharks at 4 Pines Park, 4:05pmSea Eagles’ burning question: Can the Sea Eagles finally pick up a big scalp?So far this season, Manly are travelling along ok without being too flash hot.Inconsistency is an issue, with Anthony Seibold’s men unable to string together some good form for more than a couple of weeks. On paper, they are a team that should be battling for a top four spot, but at the moment, they are stuck in mediocrity. What might help them get out of that is a win against a genuine top eight team.In 2025, the Sea Eagles have only beaten one team currently sitting in the eight (Raiders). They’ll have a chance against the Sharks to pick up their second top eight scalp, otherwise they risk falling out of the eight. Like Manly, the Sharks have been hot and cold, so it’s a very winnable game. However, it’s hard to put too much confidence in the Sea Eagles at the minute.The Daly Cherry-Evans bombshell has been a distraction no doubt, but it would be extremely disappointing if Manly were on the outside looking in approaching the midway point of the season. Sharks’ burning question: Has Nicho Hynes found his mojo and can he back it up against DCE and the Sea Eagles?Nicho Hynes faced a huge test in coming up against Mitchell Moses last weekend and he passed it with flying colours to lead the Sharks to a 28-18 win. Hynes produced three try assists and 64 run metres in his best game of the season and now the challenge is to back that up against a resurgent Manly side. The Sharks could find themselves in the top four with a win over the Sea Eagles and the Hynes holds the key to their success. Johns believes Hynes’ running game is the key to unlocking his playmaking. “I thought William Kennedy was really good, but importantly for the Sharks Nicho Hynes had about four try assists on the weekend,” Johns said. “He’s starting to get that directness back. He is getting to that target defender and they look much better.” Cronk praised Sharks coach Craig Fitzgibbon for backing Hynes and giving him the confidence to run the side his way. “He was a little bit like Cleary in that he was way more North-South than East-West,” Cronk said. “He had some nice touches and I really like what Craig Fitzgibbon said about Nicho. He stood up for his halfback. “Yes he gets attention good and bad at different stages, but for Hynes’ development, Fitzgibbon is absolutely the right coach for him. “I think he knows what hard work looks like. He stood up for him and he will support Nicho when he needs to. “If I was helping out with Nicho I would say, go back and watch some of your good touches on the weekend and realise when he does something well his first movement was forward not sideways.” Nicho Hynes was on fire against the Eels.Source: Getty ImagesBye: Sydney Roosters\", 'location': 'N/A', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: NRL Round 10 preview: Burning questions\\nENTITIES: Mitch Moses, Dolphins, Knights, Titans, Rabbitohs, Broncos, Raiders, Bulldogs, Dragons, Warriors, Cowboys, Panthers, Storm, Tigers, Sea Eagles, Sharks\\nEVENT: Previews of each NRL game in Round 10, highlighting key questions for each team, including player form, injury impacts, and strategic challenges.\\nCONTEXT: Preview of NRL Round 10 with burning questions.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 48281, 'sourceId': 926, 'url': 'https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/washington-governor-signs-rent-control-bill-law-121576799', 'title': 'Washington governor signs rent-control bill into law', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T22:32:08.000Z', 'content': \"Washington state Gov. Bob Ferguson has signed a bill into law that sets limits on rent increasesByMARTHA BELLISLE Associated PressMay 7, 2025, 5:20 PMWashington state Gov. Bob Ferguson signed a bill into law Wednesday that sets limits on rent increases, making the state among the first in the nation to provide protections for tenants.The rent stabilization measure, House Bill 1217, adds Washington to states like Oregon and California that have sought new ways to curb homelessness. Bill sponsor Sen. Emily Alvarado, a West Seattle Democrat, said the measure sets common-sense guardrails on the state’s rental-housing market “so that hardworking families and older adults don’t get unchecked excessive rent increases.”“Housing is not a luxury. It’s a basic human need,” Alvarado said at the bill signing. “And everyone in this state deserves a stable and affordable home.”The measure caps rent increases at 7% plus inflation or 10% — whichever is lower. The restrictions include single-family homes. The rent-increase cap for manufactured homes is 5%. Lawmakers approved the plan on a 54-44 vote, with five Democrats joining the Republican opposition. Ferguson praised Alvarado and the many advocates across the state who worked hard to get the bill passed. It almost didn't make it. It successfully moved through both houses, but two amendments added on the Senate floor sent it into a conference committee. Those amendments increased the cap from 7% to 10% plus inflation and exempted single-family homes. Opponents of the bill argued that developers would leave the state if it became law and said similar policies in Oregon and California added to those states’ financial burdens instead of slowing the homeless crisis.Oregon's rent-control bill was passed in 2019 and later updated to cap rent increases at either 7% plus the annual 12-month average change in the consumer price index for the U.S. West, or 10% — whichever is lower.The conference committee got the cap down to 7% plus inflation or 10% — whichever is lower, and restored protections for the 38% of renters who live in single-family homes. With Ferguson's signature, it's now law.“This law is a good beginning. It’s long overdue and it’s urgently needed,” Alvarado said. “Forty percent of the people in the state of Washington are renters or manufactured homeowners and before today they had no protections over how high the rent can go, leading to pain and to devastating destabilization of families and communities.”Ferguson also signed nine other bills to help homeowners and renters. He said when he campaigned for governor, affordable housing was the top issue voters raised, so he supports bills to help make it easier to secure housing.“Let’s make this the session of affordable housing,” he said before signing the first measure. The other measures included limits on certain provisions in rental agreements, notices for mobile home communities, and property tax relief for disabled veterans.\", 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Washington enacts rent control with new law\\nENTITIES: Bob Ferguson, Emily Alvarado, Washington State Legislature\\nEVENT: Washington state Gov.

Starmer agreed a three-year compromise in the deal unveiled on Tuesday.“The Tories offered us two years but we said it wasn’t enough,” the Indian official said. “They put it on the table. We wanted more than three, but the principle had already been conceded in return for some gives on our sides on services.”Indian officials say the trade deal was “95 per cent done” while Badenoch was business secretary in Rishi Sunak’s government, but negotiations were paused because of elections in both countries.Badenoch has strongly criticised the national insurance element of the trade deal. “This is two-tier taxes from two-tier Keir,” she tweeted, adding that she refused to sign the deal.Badenoch’s spokesperson denied the Indian account of the NI negotiations, saying: “The Indians put it on the table and Kemi said No. Hence why we didn’t sign the deal.”The Tory leader said on X: “This is total and utter rubbish. I never agreed to any such tax deal. The evidence couldn’t be clearer — I refused to sign the deal. As I have always said, no deal is better than a bad deal.”India pushed hard during the three-year negotiations for the “Double Contribution Convention”, which will give Indian employers in the UK relief from Britain’s 15 per cent national insurance levy paid by companies.\\xa0The deal to avoid double taxation also covers NI contributions paid by employees, with New Delhi estimating it will cut costs for companies employing Indian workers posted to the UK by about 20 per cent.Starmer said the double taxation deal was part of agreements Britain already had with 50 other countries and that the criticism was “incoherent nonsense”. He challenged Badenoch to say whether she would rip them up.The prime minister told MPs: “The deal with India is a huge win for working people in this country.” He added: “It’s the biggest trade deal the UK has delivered since we left the EU.”Badenoch did not raise the India trade deal at Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday, with a number of senior Conservatives publicly endorsing the outcome of the discussions.Following Prime Minister’s Questions, Badenoch’s spokesperson called on the government to quickly publish a full impact assessment on both the cost of the double taxation agreement to the UK exchequer and the likely change in the number of Indian workers coming to the UK.“There needs to be a full assessment of how much this will cost and how many people this will lead to,” Badenoch’s spokesman said.Earlier, Sir Oliver Dowden, former Tory deputy prime minister, welcomed the deal, writing on X that it “builds on significant progress made by the previous Conservative government”.Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Brexiter former business secretary, said on X: “Cheaper food and drink including rice and tea, footwear and clothing thanks to a welcome trade deal with India.

Running as of April 2025, the new clock is pending approval before it joins roughly 450 other clocks worldwide in defining Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), the global system for measuring the ultraprecise beat of a second.Time signals are \"used literally billions of times each day for everything from setting clocks and watches to ensuring the accurate time stamping of hundreds of billions of dollars of electronic financial transactions,\" Liz Donley, chief of the Time and Frequency Division at NIST, said in a statement. (Donley is not credited as one of the new paper\\'s authors).The growing need for more precise timekeeping means that scientists are always working to develop better reference clocks — ones that define the time others are set by. Unlike their everyday counterparts, these reference devices are atomic clocks, deriving their ticks from the vibrations of atoms.Related: \\'A dream come true\\': Nuclear clock breakthrough could revolutionize study of the universe\\'s fundamental forcesNIST-F4 is a type of atomic clock known as a fountain clock, containing a cloud of thousands cesium atoms cooled to near absolute zero using lasers. The atoms are then thrown upwards under the impulse provided by a pair of laser beams, then fall under their own weight while passing through a microwave beam tuned to make the atoms oscillate.Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Counting this frequency (which occurs 9,192,631,770 times every second) enables scientists to precisely define the international second.NIST scientists Greg Hoth (left) and Vladislav Gerginov work on NIST-F4, NIST’s new cesium fountain clock, one of the most precise atomic clocks ever created. (Image credit: R. Eskalis/NIST)But that\\'s the relatively simple part. To ensure NIST-F4\\'s reliability, the scientists had to account for every source of miniscule noise that could affect the cesium atoms\\' vibrations. These include quantum cross-talk with other atoms; microwave leakage and lensing effects; and subtle distortions in the electromagnetic fields generated by the lasers.The team began making these tweaks in 2020, four years after the agency\\'s first fountain clock, NIST-F1, was decommissioned for restoration. This work included rebuilding the microwave cavity at the core of the clock from scratch.\"Evaluating a fountain clock like NIST-F4 is a slow process,\" first study author Vladislav Gerginov, a physicist at NIST who worked on the new design, said in the statement. \"We have to be very conservative. We should know everything about it.\"RELATED STORIESThe result is a clock with a total a total systematic uncertainty of 2.2×10⁻¹⁶ — a precision that means it loses less than a second every 140 million years. This extremely subtle lag is the product of noise from the randomness inherent in quantum measurements, a factor the scientists say could be reduced with better oscillators and refined laser cooling.NIST-F4 will tick alongside its precursor clock NIST-F3. The newer clock will operate around 90% of the time, and at least one of the clocks will run at any given time.

Though neither wants full-blown conflict, the dispute over Kashmir has produced three wars and multiple crises over eight decades. When two nuclear-armed neighbours clash, we should worry.One reason is that errors and misjudgments are always possible. Following its overnight strikes on Pakistan, which it accuses of involvement in the massacre of Hindu tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir last month, India said that it hit only terrorist infrastructure and that its actions were “not escalatory”. This is not a judgment that can be made unilaterally. Pakistan said India was “igniting an inferno” and that its military is authorised to take corresponding actions.The second cause for concern is the shifting context of the hostility. In India, Narendra Modi’s success is built on his identity as a Hindu nationalist strongman. He is also under intense pressure because he had declared unequivocally that Kashmir had returned to normalcy and would be not only “terror-free but [also] a heaven for tourists”.In Pakistan, where the military pulls the strings, the parlous state of the economy is only one cause of the generals’ unpopularity. Last month, the army chief, Asim Munir, stirred controversy by calling Kashmir Pakistan’s “jugular vein” – a loaded phrase echoing the description of its founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. That rhetoric angered India even before the Kashmir attack that came five days later.The massacre was claimed by the Resistance Front, regarded by India as a proxy of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba. Islamabad denies any link, but the military’s connections with militant groups are opaque. India is becoming increasingly blunt about attributing blame.In the past, the US has pushed the two sides to de-escalate. But the Trump administration has little attention to spare and less diplomatic capacity. It does not have an ambassador in New Delhi. Its relations with Pakistan are at a low. Europe is preoccupied by Ukraine, security and US tariffs. Beijing should press Pakistan to keep a cool head.Pakistan’s response to the strikes may soon be clearer. In the last crisis, in 2019, the two sides quietly stepped back from the brink. India can say it has struck; Pakistan says that it downed Indian jets (Indian officials have reportedly confirmed losing aircraft). Such an outcome would be a relief for civilians along the line of control – the de facto border – who are once more paying for decisions made far away as heavy artillery fire continues. But it might be only a temporary reprieve, and not for all. India’s announcement that it was suspending the Indus waters treaty – which might ultimately allow it to turn off the tap – is less dramatic than firing missiles, but could prove devastating for farmers in Pakistan.Last year, Mr Modi promised to restore the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, which his government wrongly demoted to centrally administered territories six years ago. He should do so. That decision, and the lockdown that followed, have fuelled anger and militancy. Pressure should be maintained on the Pakistani military over its dangerous accommodation of militants.The scholar Sumit Ganguly notes in his book Deadly Impasse that the two nations have often shown striking strategic restraint, but also that the dispute remains “remarkably durable”. It would be complacent to count on calibration.\\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The government has also asked the water CEOs to do more to avert water shortages, and the EA said hosepipe bans are on the horizon if a significant amount of rain does not fall.Members of the National Drought Group, who met on Wednesday to discuss their plans, told the Guardian that there is “no slack” in the system, that water companies are “woefully underprepared” for drought and the plan for many is “simply praying for rain”.It has been the driest start to spring in 69 years. England saw its driest March since 1961 and in April the country received just half its normal rainfall. Farmers have had to start irrigating crops earlier, and reservoir levels are either notably or exceptionally low across thenorth-east and north-west of England.According to the National Farmers’ Union (NFU) some crops are already failing, and significant rainfall in early May will be essential to avoid significant yield penalties and further losses. Livestock yields could also be at risk; grazing is not yet short, but farmers point out that fields will need a decent amount of rain to get animals through the summer.NFU deputy president, David Exwood, said: “The dry conditions and lack of any substantial rainfall has meant farmers in some parts of the country have started to irrigate crops much earlier than normal. The extreme weather patterns we have experienced over the past few years are impacting our ability to feed the nation.”The last time the UK was hit with a bad drought was 2022, when crops failed and London and the south-east almost ran out of water and were weeks from going into emergency measures. There were also hosepipe bans across the country. Experts at the NDG said the conditions this year are similar to those in 2022.Reservoir levels are lower than they were this time in 2022, however. Reservoir storage across England is 84% of total capacity, compared to 90% at the end of April in 2022. The NDG heard that a number of reservoirs in the north are well below what they should be for this time of year, and that northern water companies are upping their activities around fixing leaks ahead of summer. They are already looking at extracting from rivers, months before they would generally need to, and river flows are exceptionally low at present. The NDG heard that there have been mass fish deaths above what would be expected for this time of year.“There’s no resilience in the system,” said a NDG source, adding: “All the Environment Agency and water companies kept saying was, ‘we hope it’s going to rain’.”Stuart Singleton-White, head of campaigns at the Angling Trust, said: “If the summer remains as dry as this spring, the driest spring since the infamous year of 1976, then we’re all going to pay the price for the complacency that has been the hallmark of the way water companies have managed our water. No new reservoirs since privatisation, alarming rates of leakage, and lack of preparation for the impacts of climate change.“With fish kills already at a high level and many rivers at a low level for the time of year, it could turn out to be a challenging summer of drought and devastation for our rivers and fish.

It was triggered in part by an incident on April 28, when air traffic controllers for the airport experienced a radar and communications blackout. They were unable to reach approaching planes. There were no accidents, and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy later told reporters that the outage lasted for 30 seconds. After that incident, several air traffic controllers took time off to deal with the stress and trauma. That, on top of bad weather, a runway that\\'s closed for repair and an already short-staffed air traffic controller corps, led to a lot of disruption.\\nDavid Grizzle, the former chief operating officer and head of air traffic control for the Federal Aviation Administration, says what happened at Newark isn\\'t surprising, given decades-old staffing and technology issues.

Kim, who described something of a Fred Funk emanating from the toilets at last month's RBC Heritage event on Hilton Head Island.'There are player/caddie only porta potties near tee boxes,' Kim wrote on X. 'One caddie went to use one on Thursday morning and in the corner of the porta potty, sees a pair of boxer briefs with some [poop emoji].'They tried to find out who it was but couldn't figure it out,' he added.There was one suspect, but as Kim explained, that individual has since been exonerated.'The briefs were a brand that had a brand ambassador but it was proven that it wasn't him lol,' Kim wrote. Kim lines up a put at the RBC Heritage, where one golfer or caddy had a bathroom incident The inside dirt was shared online by PGA's Michael S. Kim, who described something of a Fred Funk emanating from the toilets at last month's RBC Heritage event on Hilton Head Island Fan reactions ranged from the humorous ('thank stinks') to the constructive.'Mike,' one wrote in response. 'Not sure who is running lead on the investigation but I'd like to recommend looking to see if anyone withdrew during or after Thursdays (sic) round citing an illness.'Alas, nobody withdrew from the event, which was won by Justin Thomas at -17 for the tournament.This is hardly the sport's first high-profile bathroom incident.Ireland's Padraig Harrington made a mid-round sprint for a porta potty during a 2023 Champions Tour event at PGA Frisco – something he blamed on his advancing age.'I went in the toilet,' said Harrington, who was 51 at the time. 'The door was locked. Took me a few minutes to realize there wasn't somebody in there, another while to get the door open.'As we are on the Champions Tour, I had the longest pee ever. And then I kind of rushed down the fairway and hit my shot.' The incident described by Kim played out at the recent RBC Heritage in South Carolina Unfortunately for Harrington, that approach shot landed in the penalty area. He would finish the hole with a double-bogey 6.'So, when you get over 50, it sometimes takes a long time to have a pee,' Harrington said. 'That's my excuse. That's got to be original, I would assume.'There was another incident at this year's Masters, where Spanish amateur Jose Luis Ballester urinated into Rae's Creek at the 13th. The situation nearly resulted in a punishment for the 21-year-old, who claimed to have forgotten about the bathrooms located nearby.'I completely forgot that we had those restrooms to the left of the tee box,' an unrepentant Ballester explained after he was caught in the act. 'I really needed to pee. I didn't really know where to go…I'm like, I'm just going to sneak here in the river and probably people would not see me that much, and then they clapped for me.'He has since apologized to Augusta National and told reporters that he hopes to 'just move on from this moment.'\", 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: PGA Golfer Reveals Disgusting Porta Potty Mishap\\nENTITIES: Michael S.

But Judge Steven Hippler wrote that Kohberger's Sixth Amendment right to a public trial also entitles him to have his parents and siblings present if they want to attend.“Courts recognize that having defendant’s family members present at trial advances the values served by the right to public trial, i.e., ensuring fair proceedings; reminding the prosecutor and judge of their grave responsibilities; discouraging perjury; and encouraging witnesses to come forward,” Hippler wrote.Kohberger, 30, a former graduate student in criminal justice at nearby Washington State University, is charged in the stabbing deaths of Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves at a rental home near campus in Moscow, Idaho, on Nov. 13, 2022.Prosecutors have said they intended to seek the death penalty if Kohberger is convicted at his trial, which is set to begin in August.Hippler said the court must balance Kohberger's right to a public trial with the state's interest in obtaining forthright testimony from witnesses. But, he added, there is little risk of Kohberger's family members shaping what they might say from the witness stand in response to what they observe at the trial: The scope of their proposed testimony is narrow, and they have previously given recorded interviews that will help guard against them altering what they say.Hippler previously ruled that family members of the victims may attend the trial.\", 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Kohberger's family can attend murder trial\\nENTITIES: Bryan Kohberger, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen, Kaylee Goncalves, Steven Hippler\\nEVENT: Judge allows Kohberger's family to attend trial despite potential testimony, balancing public trial rights with witness integrity.\\nCONTEXT: Judge balances defendant's rights with witness testimony integrity.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 47014, 'sourceId': 888, 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/07/world/pope-conclave-updates/a-top-cardinal-asks-for-divine-guidance-at-a-difficult-moment-in-history', 'title': 'No Pope Elected in Conclave’s First Vote', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T15:12:54.000Z', 'content': 'PinnedHere’s the latest.Black smoke puffed from a chimney above the Sistine Chapel on Wednesday night, signaling that 133 cardinals sequestered inside had not reached a decision in a first round of voting for a new pope to lead the world’s 1.4 billion Roman Catholics.The initial vote had not been expected to yield a pontiff. The cardinals, the most ever to gather in a papal conclave, will retire to guest quarters at the Vatican and return on Thursday morning to continue voting. They will remain isolated during their deliberations, without phone or internet access and under oaths of total secrecy, until a two-thirds majority agrees on a candidate.The first conclave in more than a decade, a little more than two weeks after Pope Francis’ death set in motion the process of choosing his successor, comes during an uncertain time for the church, which is facing difficult decisions about its future direction, strained finances and a reckoning over past sexual abuse scandals.After a morning Mass, the conclave began as the cardinals, all men and nearly all over age 50, filed in a solemn procession into the Sistine Chapel, where they took assigned seats at long wooden tables under the soaring frescoes of Renaissance masters.The papal election is one of the world’s oldest dramas, but this one is unlike any before it, with many cardinals appointed by Francis meeting one another for the first time. The new faces bring unfamiliar politics, priorities and concerns that some experts say could make the selection process more fragmented than usual. Francis also left the church deeply divided, with progressive factions pushing for more inclusion and change and conservatives seeking to roll things back, often under the guise of preserving unity.Here’s what to know:How it works: The cardinals will participate in four rounds of voting every day until a candidate achieves a two-thirds majority. The ballots are burned after two rounds of voting, and the smoke above the Sistine Chapel signals whether a decision has been made — black smoke for no decision, white if there is a pope. There is no indication of how long it will take, though the last two conclaves reached decisions within two days.Possible successors: Predicting the outcome of a papal election is always challenging, but oddsmakers say that two top contenders are Cardinal Pietro Parolin of Italy, who was Francis’ second-in-command, and Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of the Philippines, a country where the church is growing rapidly.Referendum on Francis: The election in many ways will turn on whether the cardinals want a pope who will follow Francis’ path of openness and inclusion or forge a different one. During his 12-year pontificate, Francis made global headlines for landmark declarations that encouraged liberals, including allowing the blessing of people in same-sex unions and raising his voice for migrants.Test your knowledge: How well do you know the process of selecting a pope?

All 133 voting cardinals must write the name of the man he sees as pope on a rectangular piece of paper under the phrase “Eligo in Summum Pontificem,” or “I elect as the supreme pontiff.” Cardinals individually walk their ballots to the chapel’s altar, where they say an oath in Latin, and leave the ballot on a plate.Votes are counted before being read aloud and pierced and tied together with a red string (the “Conclave” film depicted this practice). After ballots are counted, they are burned.Smoke emerges from the Sistine Chapel up to twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Black smoke tells the world that the cardinals haven’t reached a decision; white smoke announces that a new pope has been chosen.Both of the past two popes — Benedict XVI in 2005 and Francis in 2013 — were elected in two days. For the past two centuries, each pope was selected within four days or fewer.The cardinal electors will take Sunday off for prayer if a pope has not been selected by Saturday afternoon.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMay 7, 2025, 4:24 p.m. ETMay 7, 2025Paper ballots and sacred oaths: the objects guiding the conclave.From left, wooden balls with numbers corresponding to each cardinal elector; papal vestments that the new pope will don; and the doors of the Apostolic Palace, which are closed with the Pontifical Swiss Guard seal.The conclave to elect the next pope is now underway at the Vatican. The cardinals — the prelates who are just below the pope in the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy — will vote by secret ballot for a successor to Pope Francis until one candidate earns a two-thirds majority.While we may not know what’s being said during the conclave — it is off limits to outsiders — we do have a pretty good idea what it will look like. During the gathering, the cardinals will follow specific instructions and use several distinctive objects to facilitate the process, many steeped in tradition.Here’s a look at some of those objects, and the meaning behind them.Voting InstrumentsWhen the cardinals vote in the Sistine Chapel, they will be sitting in rows of simple wooden tables. At one end of the chapel, a large table is set up for those who run the voting, according to the Universi Dominici Gregis, or U.D.G., one of the documents used to govern the papal transition.The room also contains voting instruments, including an urn to receive the ballots, a set of wooden balls, and a needle and twine. The urn is used to collect the ballots, rectangular pieces of paper printed with the Latin phrase “Eligo in Summum Pontificem” (“I elect as Supreme Pontiff”).The ballots contain a space where each cardinal writes in the name of his chosen candidate. The ballots are placed in the urn and are removed for counting after all the cardinals have voted.The wooden balls are used to keep track of the ballots. The balls have numbers written on them that correspond to the number of cardinals voting in the conclave. As the ballots are being counted, an attendant removes one of the wooden balls for each ballot, to ensure that the number matches the number of cardinals, according to The Catholic Advocate, formerly a newspaper of the Archdiocese of Newark, N.J. If the numbers don’t match, the ballots must be burned without being read and another vote is conducted immediately, according to the U.D.G.As the ballots are being read, they are pierced with the needle through the word “Eligo” and strung onto the thread, “so that the ballots can be more securely preserved,” according to the U.D.G.ImageMembers of the clergy and conclave staff taking the oath of secrecy in the Pauline Chapel earlier this week.Credit...The VaticanThe Oath of SecrecyThe conclave is a secretive institution, and many steps are taken to prevent leaks, including restricting the cardinals’ use of phones, the internet and newspapers.The members of the College of Cardinals, the body that will elect the pope, must also swear and sign an oath of secrecy, according to the U.D.G. The oath reads, in part: “I will observe absolute and perpetual secrecy with all who are not part of the College of Cardinal electors concerning all matters directly or indirectly related to the ballots cast and their scrutiny for the election of the Supreme Pontiff.”The cardinals also must promise not to record anything in Vatican City during the time of the election. The punishment for breaking the oath is “automatic” excommunication, according to the oath.ImageA temporary stove in the Sistine Chapel in a photo provided by the Vatican.Credit...The VaticanThe StoveThe weekend before the conclave began, Vatican workers installed a simple stove in which ballots would be burned in the Sistine Chapel. Fire crews also installed a chimney on the roof of the chapel, where the smoke will leave the building.After each round of voting, the ballots are mixed with chemicals that, when burned, emit either black or white smoke. Black smoke means that the cardinals have not yet reached the requisite majority; white smoke means that a new pope has been elected and voting is over.The SealAt the beginning of the conclave, the Apostolic Palace, which contains the Sistine Chapel, is closed to the public. On Wednesday, members of the Pontifical Swiss Guard placed beaded ropes with the guard’s seal at the entrances to the palace to ensure privacy and maintain secrecy for the cardinals.The Vatican City government also planned to deactivate cellphone service within its territory for the duration of the conclave, starting on Wednesday afternoon.The Papal VestmentsAfter a pope is elected, he is taken to the “Room of Tears,” a small room next to the Sistine Chapel, where he will put on the white papal cassock for the first time. Garments in three sizes are prepared and kept in the room, since no one knows who — or what size — the next pope will be.The room is known as the “Room of Tears” because there are accounts of previous popes becoming overwhelmed with emotion in the room, and being moved to tears, after their election. After the pope puts on the vestments, he is introduced to the public for the first time.May 7, 2025, 4:01 p.m. ETMay 7, 2025The faithful and the curious gather in St. Peter’s Square.ImageThe crowd in St. Peter’s Square reacts to the black smoke emanating from a Vatican chimney, indicating no decision has been made on a new pope. Credit...Eloisa Lopez/ReutersAfter the men who will select the next pope were locked inside the Sistine Chapel without cellphones on Wednesday, the only thing left to do was wait for them to send a signal to the outside world. By smoke.The highly secret voting began inside what is possibly one of the world’s most secure vaults in the early evening, with the 133 cardinals tasked with deciding who will succeed Pope Francis writing candidates’ names on voting cards by hand, trying to disguise their handwriting.Outside in St. Peter’s Square, thousands of the faithful, the curious and the vacationing gathered to await the news of whether the cardinals had managed to elect a papal successor. Word came at 9 p.m., in the form of black smoke billowing from a chimney installed last week on the roof of the chapel.If the smoke had been white, it would have meant that the cardinals had chosen the first new pope in a dozen years in just one round of voting, a feat not seen for centuries.But the black smoke, created when the cardinals’ ballots are incinerated in a cast-iron stove, means they’ll have to try again.“We are cold, we’re hungry, we’re thirsty but yet we can’t move,” said the Rev. Peter Mangum, 61, a priest at the Church of Jesus the Good Shepherd in Monroe, La. He and three other priests had been in the square for about seven hours, and it was Father Mangum’s fourth time waiting for news of a new pope.He had stood in the same spot for the elections of John Paul II, Benedict XVI and Francis, and he wasn’t going to budge until he knew Wednesday’s news. “We had to make sure the smoke was black,” he said.ImageThe black smoke flowing out from the Sistine Chapel on Wednesday night. Credit...Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesIt took two days to elect Pope Francis in 2013 and Benedict XVI in 2005. No conclave in the 20th or 21st centuries has lasted more than five days.In an era when news travels instantly around the world, the patience-requiring wait for the smoke in St. Peter’s Square is a ritual that dates back to the 19th century.For some, the anxiety was intense. “I think there’s more nervousness among the people outside than among the cardinals themselves,” said Tania Radesca, who arrived at the square at 1 p.m.Ms. Radesca, who is from Venezuela, had volunteered to help during the Jubilee, a year of pilgrimage that happens every 25 years, and she arrived in Rome just over a month ago. She was in St. Peter’s Square on Easter Sunday and caught a final glimpse of Pope Francis in his popemobile.He died a day later.Those who arrived early to score spots at the barricades closest to the front of St. Peter’s Basilica draped flags from their home countries along the barriers and befriended each other as they settled in. Others camped out on yoga mats or picnic blankets.ImageNuns praying at St. Peter’s Square as the conclave to elect the next pope gets underway, at the Vatican on Wednesday.Credit...Jeff Pachoud/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesMany had traveled a long way, specifically for the conclave. Rodrigo Pinto, 43, a retired karate instructor, flew 23 hours from Guatemala, landing on Tuesday afternoon and heading straight to St. Peter’s Square on Wednesday so he could wait for the first sign of smoke.Mr. Pinto, who was wearing a rosary, said,“I want to be a part of something I have always seen on TV, in documentaries, on the internet.” After standing in the rain in the morning and under the hot sun in the afternoon, he said, “Three hours ago, it was like hell. Sorry, St. Peter.”In a post office inside the square, Jennifer Raulli, 54, wrote postcards to her college-age children in the United States. She was in Rome on vacation with one of her daughters, who just graduated from Texas Christian University, and had gotten tickets to see Pope Francis say Mass on Wednesday. Instead, they arrived at the square to wait for the smoke that might herald the man who replaces him.“It is going to be a long couple of hours, but I would not miss it,” said Ms. Raulli, who had traveled from Pasadena, Calif. Ms. Raulli, who was raised Presbyterian and converted to Catholicism when she was 37, said she would prefer a “more conservative” pope because she would like the church to be “less politicized” and close to her vision of biblical teachings. The day of waiting began at 10 a.m. when Giovanni Battista Re, the spry, 91-year-old dean of the College of Cardinals, presided over a Mass inside St. Peter’s Basilica and implored the voting cardinals to choose “a pope who knows how best to awaken the consciences of all, and the moral and spiritual energies in today’s society.”As the cardinals gave each other the sign of peace during the service, Cardinal Re hugged Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican secretary of state under Francis and considered a leading candidate to succeed him. A microphone caught Cardinal Re wishing Cardinal Parolin best wishes.Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, another potential candidate who appeared with a fresh haircut, warmly shook his peers’ hands. Cardinal Jean-Marc Aveline, the archbishop of Marseille and also considered a papal contender, stopped for a prayer in front of the reliquary containing the remains of Pope John XXIII — a hero to many liberal Catholics for his efforts to modernize the church.ImageItalian cardinal Matteo Maria Zuppi, right, attends a Mass before the start of the conclave, at St. Peter’s Basilica in The Vatican.Credit...Dimitar Dilkoff/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesAfter lunch at the Casa Santa Marta, the lodging house inside the Vatican where the electors will stay throughout the conclave, the cardinals walked to the Sistine Chapel. As they proceeded into the chapel, they chanted the Litany of the Saints, while a choir hauntingly invoked the names of the saints. The cardinals replied with “Ora pro nobis,” or “Pray for us.” Outside in the square, many watching on the large video screens flanking the basilica swayed and echoed the cardinals’ chant.Inside the Sistine Chapel, name tags for the cardinals had been placed on the long tables where they would vote. Francis named many more cardinals than his two predecessors, some from countries far from the Vatican, and many of the papal electors — and potential popes — do not know one another.Around 5:45 p.m., Archbishop Diego Giovanni Ravelli, the master of pontifical liturgical celebrations, announced “extra omnes,” a Latin phrase that means “everybody out.” The giant wooden doors were closed, leaving the 133 cardinal electors — those under the age of 80 who can vote in the secret ballot — locked inside.ImageThe crowd in St. Peter’s Square watching a giant video screen displaying images of Diego Giovanni Ravelli, the master of pontifical liturgical celebrations, closing the doors of the Sistine Chapel.Credit...Andreas Solaro/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe cardinals will not be allowed to leave the Vatican until a two-thirds majority agrees on the next pope. Phones, internet, television and any contact from outside the Vatican walls are prohibited, a custom enforced to discourage the process from dragging on.Some veteran electors believed there would be prolonged voting. “Bring a book,” Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan of New York said he advised other cardinals, in an interview on Tuesday. The conclave began 16 days after Francis’ death on April 21. The significance of the moment was not lost even on those who had little knowledge of Catholicism.Yuichiro Yamakoshi, 41, a Japanese tourist traveling with his wife, said that after touring the Vatican museums and walking through the doors of the four main basilicas that are usually open only during the Jubilee, he started to understand the power and influence of the faith. Although the couple had come to St. Peter’s Square on Tuesday with a guide, they returned on Wednesday morning for a commemorative photo marking the conclave.As the black smoke dissipated into the sky, all there was to do was wait for another day.Of all the people coincidentally in Rome for the start of the papal conclave on Wednesday, the pilgrims from St. Cecilia Catholic Church in Houston may have had among the most poignant stories. The 47 faithful who had traveled with their priest — also coincidentally named Francis — to Rome this week had scheduled a meeting with Pope Francis on Wednesday. Instead, they were in St. Peter’s Square during the final Mass before the conclave beginning later in the day.One of the group, George Smith, 69, said, “It is a blessing for us.”As a river of people streamed out of the square, a group of Romans who had been convinced the smoke would be white shook hands and hugged. “See you tomorrow!” they said.ImageThe densely packed crowd in St. Peter’s Square on Wednesday night.Credit...Andrej Isakovic/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesReporting was contributed by Emma Bubola, Elisabetta Povoledo, Jason Horowitz, Elizabeth Dias, Matthew Mpoke Bigg, Bernhard Warner and Josephine de La Bruyère.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMay 7, 2025, 3:56 p.m. ETMay 7, 2025Survivors call on the next pope to end sexual abuse by clergy.ImageThe Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests is one of several survivors groups to have arrived in Rome since Pope Francis died.Credit...Andrew Medichini/Associated PressAs cardinals prepared to enter the Sistine Chapel on Wednesday afternoon to elect a pope, groups representing survivors of sexual abuse by priests made last-minute appeals for the next pontiff to definitively resolve the crisis, which has shadowed the Roman Catholic Church for decades.The best way forward, the groups said, was to impose a zero-tolerance policy on transgressors and those who covered up for them, and for church leaders to own up to their own mishandling of abuse cases.“We want to work with the next pope to put an end to clerical abuse,” Peter Isely, a member of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, known as SNAP, said Wednesday at a news conference.In March, the group launched a website tracking each cardinal’s record in dealing with credible allegations against priests under his watch. Few in the upper echelons of the church’s hierarchy are without blame, the group claimed.On Friday, Matteo Bruni, the Vatican spokesman, said the cardinals had discussed sexual abuse in the run-up to the conclave and considered it a “wound to be kept open” so awareness of the problem remained alive and solutions could be identified.SNAP also presented a road map for the pope’s first 100 days, describing steps its members think he should take to resolve the crisis.SNAP is only one of several survivors groups to have arrived in Rome since Pope Francis died on April 21, hoping their message will resonate with the cardinals.One international group, Ending Clergy Abuse, or ECA, echoed Martin Luther’s radical 1517 call for church reform on Tuesday evening when it brought a manifesto — titled the 95 Theses of Survivors — to the front door of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Vatican office that handles most abuse cases. They did not nail it to the door, but tried to slip it between the doors.“I rang the doorbell but they didn’t answer,” said Gemma Hickey, the president of ECA, who is a survivor of abuse. It was not until they started reading the document out loud that the door opened and an official took it. “He didn’t say anything, but it was received, so I was happy with that, even if it was just symbolic.”Francesco Zanardi, the founder of Rete L’Abuso, Italy’s largest survivors’ group, said at a news conference on Tuesday that the church laws promoted by Pope Francis to guide bishops in handling abuse were often thwarted in Italy because national laws do not force bishops to report cases of abuse to law enforcement officials.Speaking out against clerical abuse is not always without consequence. Ann Hagan Webb and Anne Barrett Doyle, of BishopAccountability.org, an archive and advocacy group, said the police stopped them when they were walking near the Vatican office that handles abuse cases holding photos of two cardinals whose records on punishing abusers have drawn scrutiny.“They told us we couldn’t carry signs,” Ms. Barrett Doyle said. The police officers took photos of their documents and called other police officers before letting them go after about 45 minutes. “At least they didn’t arrest us,” she said.Under Pope Francis, the Vatican took decidedly stronger steps than it had in the past to counter sexual abuse.Francis issued the church’s most comprehensive law yet to hold clerics accountable if they sexually abused children or vulnerable adults, or if they covered up abuse. And he apologized to survivors on many occasions, acknowledging their pain. But critics have said that the measures were not enough and often were not applied because of resistance within the church.May 7, 2025, 3:33 p.m. ETMay 7, 2025Come for the conclave, not for the food.ImagePope Francis having lunch at the Vatican in 2018. His emphasis on simple living and humility extended to the food he ate.Credit...Vincenzo Pinto/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe cardinals gathering for the conclave hope to pick the very best among them to be the leader of the Roman Catholic Church. Their culinary expectations are not so high.“Food you could eat at a train station” was how Cardinal Mauro Piacenza, a conclave veteran from the Italian city of Genoa, famous for its pesto, described the fare at the Casa Santa Marta, a guesthouse in the Vatican where the cardinals will be staying during the conclave. By train station food, he said he meant pastas with “watery sauce,” simple cutlets and salads: “Not exciting.”The ambience at Santa Marta isn’t much of a draw, either. Its cafeteria has pale green columns, utilitarian furniture and fan art in the hallway depicting Francis as a Jedi knight in “Star Wars.” But priests would angle for a reservation there because Santa Marta was the home of Pope Francis. Until he began ailing and taking his meals in his room, the pope often ate in the cafeteria at a table between the window and the refrigerator.Among the residents of the guesthouse, Francis, with his emphasis on simple living and humility, bore some blame for the decline in the food. Some lamented bland vegetables, less-than-rich pastas and leftovers from gifts to the pope — a box of dates from the Middle East, for example.Across the ideological spectrum, a consensus emerged.“You don’t eat very well,” said Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi of Italy, a supporter of Pope Francis.“It’s not so good,” said Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller of Germany, who was fired by Francis.The food at the conclave isn’t supposed to be good.The tradition of locking in the cardinals began in the 13th century, after residents of Viterbo, a town north of Rome where the election was being held, grew so frustrated with the process, which was taking years, that they ripped the roof off the building where the cardinals were meeting and reduced the menu to bread and water. The pope who came out of that election, Gregory X, decreed in 1274 that after three days of conclave, cardinals would get only one meal a day. The more days they took, the less food they got.But election menus improved. Centuries later, conclave food deliveries were inspected for secret messages — easily stuffable pies and chickens were verboten — and passed to the cardinals through a revolving door.When a 16th-century cardinal died during a conclave, some others claimed the food was poisoned. In the conclave that lasted from November 1549 to February 1550, the famed Vatican cook Bartolomeo Scappi noted that cardinals took turns acting as poison testers. Once it was clear the food was safe, they drank from carafes of wine and ate from hampers full of food.Scappi doesn’t say exactly what he fed them, but Crystal King, the author of a novel about the chef, wrote that her research led her to conclude they ate “ravioli and rabbit pappardelle” and “cheesy breads, veal croquettes, roasted bear, grilled beef ribs, open-faced mushroom crostatas, pheasant in red-currant sauce and maybe even caviar omelets.”Times have changed, and though Santa Marta is not exactly serving bread and water, the cardinals preparing to vote for the next pope know not to bring their appetites.“We will eat whatever they give us,” Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo Besungu of Congo said on Sunday. When told by a reporter about a subpar dining experience at the Santa Marta mess hall, he joked, “And you’re not dead.” He said that one had to have “trust in the Holy Spirit.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMay 7, 2025, 3:21 p.m. ETMay 7, 2025Father Peter Mangum, of Monroe, La, waited for three hours in the same spot he had stood when the cardinals selected John Paul II, Benedict XVI and Francis. “We had to make sure the smoke was black,” he said before joining the river of people leaving St. Peter’s Square. “We’ll be back tomorrow morning,” he added. “Same spot.” May 7, 2025, 3:17 p.m. ETMay 7, 2025People are filing out of the square, tired but in good spirits. “That spirit of just being together for three hours was quite beautiful,” said Father Francis Wambua, a priest from Machakos, Kenya, who is studying in Rome.

It will release a plume of white smoke if a pope has been chosen, and black smoke if no candidate has won the required two-thirds majority of votes.It’s a tradition that scholars date to the 19th century, when conclaves were held at the Quirinale Palace, the papal palace across town that is now home to the Italian president.In “Behind Locked Doors,” a 2003 history of papal elections, Frederic J. Baumgartner wrote that the first evidence he found of smoke being used as a signal in a papal election was from 1823. The cardinals’ ballots were burned in previous conclaves, he wrote, but there was no record that the smoke was intended to inform the outside world of a new pope.The smoke comes from the burning of the ballots, as well as any notes that the cardinals have taken, which are placed in a cast-iron stove after each round of voting. (One round is held the first day, and four each day from then on, with two in the morning and two in the afternoon.) The ballots are burned after two rounds of voting, unless a pope is chosen.Until this century, wet straw was added to the stove to create the smoke’s white color. But it wasn’t always reliable.As The New York Times reported, during the 1958 conclave, white smoke seemed to appear twice during the second day of voting. That created confusion because, in fact, a pope had not yet been selected.A Times reporter described the frenzy outside St. Peter’s: “Dozens of newspapermen in the square made a dash for the nearest telephone,” and guests at a wedding inside the basilica dashed outside, “leaving the bride and bridegroom alone in front of a priest at the altar.”But it was a false alarm. The confusion in that conclave, which elected Pope John XXIII, led to conspiracy theories that another cardinal had been the real winner.In 1978, cartridges were first used to enhance the black or the white color of the smoke during the conclave that elected John Paul I. When he died suddenly 33 days after he was elected, the cartridges were used again in the election that year of his successor, John Paul II.ImageWhite smoke announcing that a new pope had been elected in 2013.Credit...Gregorio Borgia/Associated PressThat method was also imperfect science. In the case of John Paul I, an amusing video from the time shows befuddled reporters panicking as white smoke from the chimney turns black. “You can’t understand anything,” one frazzled reporter screams into a telephone. The Vatican later announced that a pope had been elected.By 2005, when John Paul II died, a more reliable system was devised that remains in use today. An electronic control unit resembling a stove is now placed alongside the cast-iron stove — they share a chimney flue — to burn cartridges that color the smoke from the ballots.Massimiliano De Sanctis, a fireworks expert, customized one of his fireworks machines for the Vatican, and it was used for the 2005 conclave that elected Benedict XVI and the 2013 conclave that elected Francis.“We didn’t invent anything new,” he said in an interview. “It’s the system used for fireworks.”The black or white smoke cartridges are placed in the unit, and when the ballots are burned in the cast-iron stove, a cardinal presses a button to set off the cartridges in the unit, coloring the smoke. For each vote, six cartridges are used, and the smoke lasts about seven minutes, Mr. De Sanctis said.After the confusion of the past, the Vatican doesn’t take chances: Once white smoke comes out of the chimney, bells will begin pealing from St. Peter’s Basilica, calling other churches in Rome to ring their bells as well.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMay 7, 2025, 12:44 p.m. ETMay 7, 2025A sea gull took center stage at the last conclave.ImageA sea gull on the chimney atop the Sistine Chapel.Credit...Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesA solitary chimney above the Sistine Chapel will soon be the most watched object in the world.After each round of voting during the conclave to choose a new pope, the ballots are burned, and a glimpse at the chimney atop the Vatican signals the results. White smoke signifies that a new pope has been elected. Black smoke means more voting is needed. A sea gull sitting on the chimney means … wait, what now?During the last conclave in 2013, as millions focused their gaze on the roof of the Sistine Chapel, a sea gull landed on the chimney’s metal cover at an opportune moment.Was it a symbol? A blessing? A sign? Would the white bird signify white smoke?“That seagull on the Sistine Chapel roof by the conclave is great product placement for the Holy Spirit,” James Martin, a Jesuit priest, posted on Twitter at the time.The sea gull quickly became the most famous bird in the world. A social media account aptly named the Sistine Seagull was created almost immediately.“I can see them voting from up here, btw,” the account posted on Twitter, using an abbreviation for “by the way.” “Anybody has any questions, just ask.”The sea gull remained on the chimney for about 40 minutes.About an hour after the bird flew away, white smoke emerged from the chimney. Pope Francis had been chosen.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMay 7, 2025, 12:18 p.m. ETMay 7, 2025The Sistine Chapel becomes the world’s most beautiful polling place.ImageInside the Sistine Chapel.Credit...Andreas Solaro/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesCardinals are voting inside the Sistine Chapel beneath frescoes painted by Renaissance masters, a vaulted ceiling decorated by Michelangelo that is a landmark of Western art and his powerful “Last Judgment” on the eastern wall.It may be the world’s most beautiful polling place. Already internationally renowned, it is now “at the center of the attention of the world,” Barbara Jatta, the director of the Vatican Museums, told reporters on Tuesday.The Sistine Chapel is named after Sixtus IV, who became pope in 1471 and commissioned its construction as the primary chapel of the papal court. It has been posited, though there are skeptics, that the chapel’s dimensions — 131 feet by 42 feet, with ceilings 65 feet high — were meant to recall the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem as described in the Old Testament, Ms. Jatta said.ImageDetail of the ceiling.Credit...Fotopress/Getty ImagesBetween 1481 and 1483, Sixtus hired some of the greatest artists of the time — Perugino, Botticelli, Signorelli and Ghirlandaio — to fresco the walls of the chapel, which Ms. Jatta said is “symbolic of our faith, our art and our history.” The frescos depict scenes from the lives of Jesus Christ and Moses.When Julius II, the nephew of Pope Sixtus IV, became pope in 1503, he began an ambitious building program that included revamping St. Peter’s Basilica and completing the Sistine Chapel.In 1508, he brought in Michelangelo to paint the Sistine’s vault, replacing a previous fresco depicting a starry sky. Working alone on a platform and craning his neck while standing, as a sketched self-portrait shows, Michelangelo painted nine scenes from the Old Testament’s Book of Genesis, and nude figures (known as ignudi), prophets and sybils. It took him four years.Michelangelo later received a commission from Pope Clement VII to paint the wall behind the altar with a rendering of the Last Judgment. In his biography of Michelangelo, Giorgio Vasari wrote that Clement VII had wanted him to paint the work “so that he could demonstrate in this scene all that the art of design was capable of achieving.”Image“The Last Judgment” by Michelangelo.Credit...Fine Art Images/Heritage Images, via Getty ImagesMichelangelo hadn’t been thrilled by the gig. He considered himself a sculptor first and foremost, “but the pope called him and he was a faithful person,” said Ralf van Bühren, who teaches art history at the Santa Croce Pontifical University in Rome. In “The Last Judgment,” Michelangelo depicted a self-portrait in the skin of flayed St. Bartholomew, to show “he suffered so much, he didn’t like to paint,” he said.Not everyone was enthusiastic about “The Last Judgment,” with some clerics complaining that too many figures were nude. But Paul III, who became pope in 1534, was a fan. It is said that he fell on his knees, his eyes filling with tears, when the fresco was unveiled in 1541.Some believe the art will serve as inspiration to the cardinal electors as they gather beneath the frescoes.“The contemplation of these images evokes the spiritual responsibility of their vote,” Ms. Jatta said.ImageThe Sistine Chapel has been temporarily closed to tourists during the process of picking a new pope.Credit...Dimitar Dilkoff/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesFor the conclave, carpenters built a raised, beige-carpeted platform about two feet above the original floor so that it will be level with the second step leading to the altar. Running the length of the chapel are long tables where the cardinals will sit on cherry wood chairs marked with their names.The Sistine Chapel has been temporarily closed for days, disappointing tourists who may have planned to visit before Pope Francis’ death on April 21 set the succession process in motion.Last year, about 7 million visitors trooped through the Sistine Chapel, Ms. Jatta said. The chapel is “hyper monitored” with sensors, she said, and equipped with special lighting and an energy efficient air-conditioning system to minimize wear and tear on the space.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMay 7, 2025, 11:56 a.m. ETMay 7, 2025How does the voting work?ImageCardinals gathered for a Mass before the start of the conclave on Wednesday.Credit...Dimitar Dilkoff/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesCasting ballots for pope is a carefully laid out ritual.According to established rules, lots are drawn to select nine cardinals who will have a role in the election. They are divided into three groups:Scrutineers: Three cardinals who oversee the entire process.Infirmarii: Three cardinals who collect the votes of any electors who are sick (though none was believed to be ill as of Wednesday).Revisers: Three cardinals who double-check the ballots at the end of each round of voting.The cardinals, sitting at long tables inside the Sistine Chapel, each receive rectangular pieces of paper printed with the Latin phrase “Eligo in Summum Pontificem,” or, “I elect as the supreme pontiff.” Beneath that, they write the name of their choice for pope.The 1996 conclave rules specify that the vote must be secret and the candidate’s name legible, “taking care not to write other names as well, since this would make the ballot null.” One by one, the cardinals walk with their ballot toward the chapel’s altar. Facing the eastern wall, which is decorated with Michelangelo’s “The Last Judgment,” each cardinal utters an oath, in Latin: “I call as my witness Christ the Lord who will be my judge, that my vote is given to the one who before God I think should be elected.”Then the cardinal places the ballot on a plate and slides it into an urn, traditionally a large chalice.After all the cardinals have voted, one of the scrutineers mixes the ballots by shaking the chalice. Then the votes are counted individually and placed into a second container. The number of ballots and voters have to match; otherwise, the vote is void.The ballots are then opened and read by all three scrutineers. The third one announces the name out loud, and records it.Once the votes have been tallied, a scrutineer pierces each ballot with a needle and threads them together with a red string. After the revisers check the count, the ballots are burned.Except for the first day, when there is only one vote, two votes take place every morning and two every afternoon, until two-thirds of the cardinals agree on the choice.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMay 7, 2025, 8:13 a.m. ETMay 7, 2025A top cardinal asks for divine guidance at a ‘difficult’ moment in history.Video\\nAdvertisement\\nLIVE\\n00:00\\n0:37\\nPresiding over a Mass before the conclave, the dean of the College of Cardinals, Giovanni Battista Re, asked the cardinals to elect a pope whom “the church and humanity” need at a “difficult, complex and tormented” time.CreditCredit...Murad Sezer/ReutersThe first conclave rituals began on Wednesday morning, with dozens of cardinals and bishops attending a solemn Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica to invoke the Holy Spirit to help them pick the next pope.It was the last large public event the voting eminences were expected to attend before entering into seclusion and beginning to cast ballots in the Sistine Chapel on Wednesday afternoon.Giovanni Battista Re, the spry, 91-year-old dean of the College of Cardinals, presided over the Mass in the basilica built on the tomb of St. Peter, the Roman Catholic Church’s first pope. In his homily, Cardinal Re made a pitch to his peers to elect a pope “whom the church and humanity need at this difficult, complex and tormented turning point in history.”He also implored the voting cardinals to choose “a pope who knows how best to awaken the consciences of all, and the moral and spiritual energies in today’s society.” (Those words could offer a boost to more charismatic candidates.)The homily was not transparently political, but it also included some strong messages to the cardinals, such as a plea “to maintain the unity of the church.” Some liberals have worried that conservatives are campaigning to roll back Pope Francis’ agenda of inclusion under the guise of preserving unity. Cardinal Re added that Christ wanted “a unity that does not mean uniformity, but a firm and profound communion in diversity.”Cardinal Re cannot vote in the conclave because he is over 80, the cutoff age. He is nevertheless a veteran of conclaves and knows what it is like inside the Sistine Chapel during the election. In the homily, he talked about selflessness and Judas, the apostle who betrayed Christ, and urged the cardinals to set aside “personal considerations” as they make their decision.Quoting Pope John Paul II, Cardinal Re expressed hopes that Michelangelo’s painting of Jesus as the judge in the Sistine Chapel would “remind everyone of the great responsibility” of placing the papacy “in the correct hands.”Wearing bishop’s miters and red capes with golden embroidery, the cardinals proceeded over the marble floor of St. Peter’s central aisle as an organ played and Latin chants resounded in the basilica. An attendant asked the worshipers not to clap as the prelates entered.One playfully tapped another on the cheek. Several held canes.Cardinal Matteo Zuppi of Italy, who has emerged as a leading contender for pope — and who appeared to have a fresh haircut — warmly shook his peers’ hands.After Mass, the cardinals removed their capes and headed for lunch at Casa Santa Marta, the guesthouse where they will be staying until they elect a pope.

But Her Honor also had one other meeting agenda item. Hours before a state ban on Pride flags took effect, the Council also added one more item, a discussion to allow new city banners. The result: three new city banners were adopted--the Pride flag, the transgender flag, and a Juneteenth flag, all of which also display the white sego lily that appears on the current city flag. By making them all official city flags, the city could bypass the state ban. The city has a majority of members on the City Council who are LGBTQ. As you might guess, it was a unanimous vote to adopt the flags as official city flags.\\xa0READ MORE: Utah Becomes First State to Ban Rainbow Flags in Schools, Government Buildings—Will Others Follow?Mendenhall said of the new city flags,\\n“As mayor, I have a duty to lawfully uphold the values of our nation, state and our city. I know that the values of diversity, equity and inclusion are not only right and just, but they are fundamental to America, even through all its struggles to uphold them.”Earlier in 2025, the Utah Legislature passed HB77,\\xa0which restricts the kinds of flags that can be flown in front of schools and government buildings. The list of flags permitted includes the American flag, state and military flags, the Olympic flag, college or university flags, and local city flags. Gov. Spencer Cox (R) did not sign the bill; therefore, banning Pride and other flags like it from being flown in front of public buildings, which goes into effect Wednesday.\\xa0Republican members of the State Legislature voiced their opposition to the new flags. House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, called it “a clear waste of time and taxpayer resources.” He added, “This law is about keeping government spaces neutral and welcoming to all. Salt Lake City should focus on real issues, not political theatrics.\" Utah Senate President Stuart Adams said:“It’s disappointing that Salt Lake City is diverting time and resources away from real pressing community needs in an attempt to bypass state law. The intent of this bill is to help ensure that government buildings remain neutral, focused on serving the public and welcoming to all.”\\nIn a move possibly to send a message to the Mayor and City Council that everyone can play the game, State Sen. Dan McKay, R-Riverton, who sponsored HB77, created a collection of flags of his own. One had a symbol of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, an Israeli flag, and one that said, \"MAGA Country.\"\\xa0He posted on X, “Proud of Erin for being so inclusive with the new 365.25 flag initiative.\" State Rep.

For individuals going through the complexities of the legal system, being informed about the defense preparation process can impact the outcome of their case. Know which factors to prioritize, the importance of legal representation, and how to communicate effectively with your legal team. Take a closer look at some tips right below — look no further!\\nThe Importance of Seeking Legal Representation\\nThe first step in preparing a legal defense is knowing the role of legal representation. Attorneys specialized in criminal law possess the expertise and knowledge to interpret complex legal jargon and procedures that a layperson might find challenging. They prepare you for court appearances and advise you on your options. Experienced criminal lawyers like Faraj Defence Lawyers will give you assurance that your rights are safeguarded and your interests are represented throughout the legal process. Having an attorney on your side can also help mitigate potential consequences and reduce stress so you can focus on your defense strategy.\\nUnderstand Your Charges\\nFamiliarize yourself with the specifics of the charges against you. Each charge carries different implications and possible penalties, which can range from fines to imprisonment. Get familiar with the nature of the accusation to develop a tailored defense strategy. Research the laws relevant to your case and provide insight into potential defenses, mitigating circumstances, or plea options available.\\nCourts have certain standards of proof required for convictions, so being aware of how those apply to your case can influence your defense. Gather evidence and witness statements, and get a better knowledge of the situation to position yourself better for discussions with your legal representation.\\nGather Evidence and Build Your Case\\nThe strength of your legal defense heavily relies on the evidence that supports your case. Collect all pertinent information, including documents, eyewitness accounts, surveillance footage, or any relevant material that may substantiate your innocence or reduce your culpability. Organize this evidence systematically, discuss with your attorney, and form the basis for your defense strategy.\\nUnderstanding the opposing side’s stance allows you to prepare counterarguments effectively. Conduct interviews with witnesses who can testify to your character or provide alibi evidence, and don’t forget to document their statements. A solid collection of evidence can build your case and add more credibility.\\nInterview Your Attorney Thoroughly\\nWhen selecting a legal representative, conduct a comprehensive interview. Ask potential attorneys about their experience with cases similar to yours. Inquire about their strategies for defense, their success rate, and how they plan to communicate with you throughout the process. Clear communication lines build a good attorney-client relationship and give you the chance to discuss your thoughts and concerns openly.\\nUnderstand their fee structure to prevent unexpected financial burdens as well. An honest appraisal of your case will help set realistic expectations concerning the potential outcome. An informed and prepared attorney will strengthen your case and empower you to address complex legal matters confidently.\\nPrepare for Court Appearances\\nPreparation extends beyond legal strategies; it also includes getting ready for court appearances. Being aware of courtroom decorum, including appropriate attire and respectful behavior, can leave a positive impression on the judge and jury. Arrive early to alleviate any feelings of anxiety associated with the court environment. Understand when to stand, speak, or present evidence to ease you into the experience.\\nDiscuss potential questions you might face during hearings with your attorney, practicing thoughtful responses that align with your defense. Be able to articulate your perspective clearly to impact the court’s perception. Preparation for testimony should not just focus on the facts of your case, but also on how you convey them emotionally and ethically. This meticulous preparation can assure a smoother court experience and potentially benefit your overall defense.\\nDevelop a Defense Strategy\\nTo create a tailored strategy, work closely with your attorney to analyze the complexities of your situation. They can assist you in identifying the strongest defenses available based on the evidence compiled, the specifics of your charges, and your goals for the case. Consider plea bargain options, or if warranted, explore taking your case to trial. Know that the strengths and weaknesses of your case can inform the best course of action.\\nExplore character witnesses or expert testimonies that can lend further credibility to your side of the story. Establish a committed approach that outlines the defense’s direction so that everyone is on the same page. A calculated and well-articulated strategy can improve the efficacy of your defense, elevating your chances for a favorable outcome.\\nThe legalities surrounding a criminal case might not be easy to navigate without proper guidance. A strong legal defense comes with a better knowledge of charges, gathering evidence, and working closely with legal representation.

But now, scientists have figured out what crops we would need to grow to sustain a city if such a calamitous event occurred.According to a new study, farming spinach, sugar beets, wheat and carrots in urban and near-urban areas could feed the population of a midsize city in a post-apocalyptic world.The scientists built on previous research to determine the optimal crops to plant after a global catastrophe — such as nuclear war, extreme pandemics or solar storms. Their goal was to find the most efficient way to feed a person using the least amount of land.\"[The research] actually wasn\\'t inspired by the current, you know, geopolitical environment,\" said study lead author Matt Boyd, founder and research director of Adapt Research, an independent research organization. \"But it has turned out to be very relevant, obviously, to the current geopolitical environment,\" Boyd told Live Science.Current events include unpredictable international politics, ongoing war in the Middle East and Europe, weaponized artificial intelligence and the ever-mounting destruction from climate change. In January, the Doomsday Clock, which indicates how close humanity is to a species-threatening disaster, ticked one second closer to midnight — the closest it has ever been to catastrophe.In the new study, published Wednesday (May 7) in the journal PLOS One, the researchers looked at how the population of a midsize city could survive with agriculture in the event of a global disaster. The study examined two scenarios should disaster strike: what to grow in and around a city under normal climate conditions, and what to grow in the event of a nuclear winter.The optimal crop to grow in a temperate city in normal conditions turned out to be a humble legume: peas. \"Peas are a high protein food. They grow well in urban agriculture environments,\" Boyd said. \"If you want to feed someone, growing peas minimizes the amount of land you need to feed that person.\"Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.However, pea plants are not frost-resistant. In the event of a nuclear winter — which could be caused by nuclear war, a supervolcano eruption or a huge asteroid strike — sunlight would be blocked \"due to all the soot and everything that\\'s been thrown up into the stratosphere,\" Boyd said. This in turn would lead to lower temperatures and make it harder for plants to photosynthesise.In that scenario, a hardier combination of spinach and sugar beets are a better choice, the researchers found.Related: \\'Nuclear winter\\' from a US-Russia conflict would wipe out 63% of the world\\'s populationBoyd and study co-author Nick Wilson, a professor of public health at the University of Otago, Wellington came to these conclusions in part by using the data from a meta-analysis of urban agriculture research that analyzed the yield of different crops in dozens of cities around the world.The researchers used Palmerston North in New Zealand as a case study of a midsize city. (Image credit: Walter Bibikow/Getty Images)Peas, for example, rose to the top in normal conditions because they require 3,143 square feet (292 square meters) of land to satisfy one person\\'s caloric and protein needs for a year, whereas a combination of cabbage and carrots required 8,364 square feet (777 square meters), said Boyd — almost three times as much land.The researchers chose Palmerston North in New Zealand, but the findings can apply to similar cities worldwide, the researchers said. With a population of roughly 90,000, it\\'s a globally midsize city, Boyd said, plus \"it\\'s inland, like many cities around the world, and it has reasonably low density, suburban type housing, not sort of Manhattan-style skyscrapers and so forth.\"The scientists then used Google imagery of Palmerston North to work out the total amount of available green spaces that could be used to grow crops, such as front lawns, backyards and parks.\"Surprise, surprise. The city can\\'t feed all its people,\" Boyd said. If food is only grown within the city bounds, the available land can feed about 20% of the population with crops that maximize protein and food energy per square foot under normal climate conditions. That number shrinks to about 16% during nuclear winter.To feed the rest of the population, people would need land immediately outside the city — about one-third of the size of the city\\'s built urban area — to sow additional efficient crops. In the case of Palmerston North, that\\'s about 2,817 acres (1,140 hectares), plus another 272 acres (110 hectares) of canola to convert into biodiesel to fuel tractors and other farm machinery.Spinach would help sustain a population during a nuclear winter, researchers found. (Image credit: Sally Jane Photographic Art/Getty Images)In the land just outside the city, the study found that potatoes are ideal for a normal climate scenario, and a combination of 97% wheat and 3% carrots is the optimal ratio during a nuclear winter because they have a higher tolerance for colder temperatures.Even in cities, \"there is a ton of farmland that can be used to grow food,\" said Theresa Nogeire-McRae, a landscape ecologist at American Farmland Trust and affiliate faculty at Oregon State University, who was not involved in the study.“People settled cities where they did for a good reason,” Nogeire-McRae told Live Science. “It was the rich soil near riverbanks. It\\'s a good commodity. Let\\'s not throw that away.\" She added that the methods of study were sound and the findings were reasonable.Related storiesBoyd noted there are a number of unknowns that would impact crop yield in the real world. Soil quality is a big variable, because lower quality soil would yield fewer crops. He also assumed a scenario where water systems were still flowing — \"but you can imagine global catastrophe scenarios where there\\'s additional obstacles and problems,\" he said. He also doesn\\'t expect people will only eat peas for an entire year, but planting the most efficient crops minimizes the amount of land needed to feed a population.Boyd said this study could be used as a first step for cities looking to use resilient urban agriculture in land use policy.\"Decisions that might seem optimal in one lens, maybe economically, may look a little bit less optimal if you were also including a lens like resilience, safety and well-being,\" he said.\\nJesse Steinmetz is a freelance reporter and public radio producer based in Massachusetts.

They appeared to include a boy selling coffee, two parents and their young son, and a market vendor sitting by his small stall.Palestinian journalist Yahya Sobeih was also killed, colleagues said, only hours after his wife gave birth to their first child.In another video, the owner of the nearby Palmyra restaurant, Abu Saleh Abdu, said many children, elderly people and passersby were killed.

Israeli officials have said they include seizing all of the territory indefinitely, forcibly displacing Palestinians to the south, and taking over aid distribution with private companies despite protests from the UN and its humanitarian partners.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that his security cabinet had decided on a \"forceful operation\" to destroy Hamas and rescue its remaining hostages. He said Gaza\\'s 2.1 million population \"will be moved, to protect it\", and that troops \"will not enter and come out\".Israel cut off all supplies to Gaza on 2 March and resumed its offensive two weeks later after the collapse of a two-month ceasefire, saying it was putting pressure on Hamas to release its 59 remaining hostages.The renewed Israeli strikes and ground operations have already resulted in hundreds of casualties and the displacement of an estimated 423,000 people, with about 70% of Gaza placed under Israeli evacuation orders, within an Israel-designated \"no-go\" zone, or both, according to the UN.Aid agencies have also warned that mass starvation is imminent unless the blockade ends.The UN has said Israel is obliged under international law to ensure food and medical supplies for Gaza\\'s population.

Pickens also drew widespread criticism in 2023 for what could generously be described as inattentive downfield blocking for his teammates.Considering his volatility, the Steelers didn’t seem interested in signing Pickens to a contract extension and he became expendable when they traded for two-time Pro Bowler DK Metcalf in March, whom they promptly signed to a five-year contract.Pickens is joining a Cowboys offense that could use another downfield threat to pair with star CeeDee Lamb.

However, when a test was conducted on the same topic, students without access to any LLM tool scored better. The children who had used ChatGPT while solving their practice problems scored 17% less.\\nWhat does this teach us? ChatGPT or any other LLM model only helps you ‘complete the task.’ However, it adds little value to your overall intellect and doesn’t contribute much to the learning spectrum. In other words, students who used ChatGPT simply copy-pasted the answers provided by the tool without understanding the process behind the solution.\\nSome argue that we already have technology like spreadsheets and calculators that automate such ‘mundane’ tasks. Why don’t we eliminate those and do stuff manually for the sake of ‘learning’?\\nWell, a key difference is that you still need to understand the formulas used on a spreadsheet to produce any usable output.\\nIt’s you who runs a spreadsheet with different formulas. A spreadsheet or a calculator does not alter the way we think; these tools still require us to use our intellect and our critical decision-making thought process.\\nHowever, AI tools are completely different.\\nInstead of helping us think, they end up thinking on our behalf. The very essence of being human is the ability to process information and ponder upon things from a critical point of view.\\nAt the risk of sounding overdramatic, AI could be the death of human thinking.\\nIncreasing Cognitive Offloading: Outsourcing Thinking\\nAnother study titled ‘AI Tools in Society: Impacts on Cognitive Offloading and the Future of Critical Thinking’ studied the correlation between cognitive offloading and the use of AI tools. Cognitive offloading is the practice of reducing mental work by offloading the task to external tools, which in this case are AI apps.\\nThe research shows that younger participants (17-25) exhibit the highest use of AI tools and also the lowest critical thinking scores. Cognitive offloading was also the highest among this age group. In contrast, older participants (46 and above) exhibited low AI tool usage and higher critical thinking scores.\\nAnd remember that the younger participants have started using AI tools only in the last couple of years. Unlike the present generation, they haven’t had access to these tools throughout their childhood or early adolescence. Even considering this relatively low exposure period, we are seeing low critical thinking and high cognitive offloading among this age group.\\nWe can extrapolate these results to the current batch of students who rely entirely on these AI tools for education. It’s reasonable to assume that if the same research is done five years down the line again, these students might get even lower critical thinking scores than the current batch.\\nThe same study shows a strong negative correlation between the use of AI tools and critical thinking.\\nThis means that the more people use these tools, the lower their critical thinking skills and scores are. Plus, there was a strong positive correlation between AI tool use and cognitive offloading. So, the more people use AI tools, the more they tend to throw away their ability to think critically.\\nAI Is Making Cheating the New Fad\\nEnter Cluely. It’s an advanced AI assistant with a tagline that reads, ‘Let’s Cheat on Everything.’ Unfortunately, that’s what it’s literally meant for – cheating the human intellect.\\nWhat’s more concerning is Cluely’s ad campaign, which shows two people on a date. The guy is wearing some sort of smart glasses, which tell him what to say next. It listens to responses from the girl and curates the ‘perfect reply.’\\nThe guy can be seen lying about his age, job, and preferences in the video. What’s more shocking is how blatantly the brand says, ‘We built Cluley so you never have to think alone again.’ Since when was this a good thing?\\nWhile this may sound fun to some people, it’s pretty bone-chilling to think where such tech might eventually take us. If the death of critical thinking and problem-solving wasn’t scary enough, there’s also the chance of AI killing our ability to have genuine human connections.\\nAlgorithmic LLMs like Cluely do not want to improve the human experience but rather replace it. Eventually, it’d just be two computer programs dating each other in human skin. Ana de Armas from Blade Runner 2049 is depressing, if you really think about it.\\nThe scarier part is that Cluely is not a backyard school project. It’s a real AI tool that has raised $5.3M in seed funding. People want tools like Cluely to make their lives easier, which does make sense. But should we really sacrifice human thinking at the altar of comfortable utility in the process?\\nAI: A Double-Edged Sword\\nNot everything is as grim as it looks.\\nAI and education have surely changed the way young minds learn. Earlier, we had to dig through several pages of a textbook to understand complex equations and theorems.\\nNow, human-like AI tools have been developed that gamify the whole learning experience and break down complex topics into small, actionable lessons.\\nSal Khan, the founder of Khan Academy, showed us the positive sides of AI in education two years back in a TED Talk when he unveiled Khanmigo, an AI learning assistant. Unlike LLMs that blurt out the answers to any question, Khanmigo gives students a hint about the math problem and encourages them to solve it themselves, still allowing them to think independently.\\nMost of our concern about AI in education is that students won’t learn how to write or think. Khanmigo solves this problem to an extent.\\nInstead of writing ‘for’ you, this AI assistant ‘writes with you.’ For example, if you want to write a story, it will direct you to write the first two lines, after which it will add another two lines and repeat the process until you have the full story. Khanmigo doesn’t kill creativity but rather stimulates it.\\nThis is a perfect example of how AI should be used in education. Rather than using it to offload our cognitive thinking, it should be used as a stimulus to human thought and the learning process as a whole.\\nThe bigger question is, whose responsibility is it to ensure learning stays a human experience? To put it bluntly, companies are not going to stop producing LLM tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude simply because they’re stifling human thinking. There’s money to be made, so goodbye moral responsibility.\\nTherefore, a large part of the responsibility falls on teachers, parents, and students themselves. Guardians should regulate the kind of AI tools a child has access to. At the same time, students should become more self-aware of the long-term harm caused by replacing their thought process with an AI prompt.\\nWhile tools like Khanmigo can become effective in the learning process, ‘feed me the answer’ kind of AI tools can kill human creativity and critical thinking. And the responsibility for the types of tools we encourage rests on our shoulders.\\nKrishi is a seasoned tech journalist with over four years of experience writing about PC hardware, consumer technology, and artificial intelligence.\\nClarity and accessibility are at the core of Krishi’s writing style.

But Virginia (Alicia Vikander) isn’t just there to ask them intrusive questions; day two starts with her having a tantrum as if she were a toddler. In Fleur Fortune’s slippery psychological drama, the couple’s attempt at parental role play – while never really knowing whether or not Virginia is being herself – turns into a tense game of manipulation, even exploitation. Vikander is the film’s chief delight as the murkily motivated visitor, but Olsen and Patel give as good as they get.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Daily Caller in March she did not have an update on when the nominations or vetting would begin, but said she would provide a list of names to the outlet.Nearly two months later, Trump began those appointments, naming a handful of Missourians to district courts as well as one individual to sit on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Joshua M. Divine of Missouri was appointed Tuesday by Trump to serve as judge on both the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri and Western District of Missouri. Divine is the solicitor general of Missouri and director of special litigation in the Missouri Attorney General’s Office. He was previously chief counsel to Republican Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley and deputy solicitor general in the Missouri Attorney General’s (AG) Office. Divine was also a law clerk to both Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and Judge William H.

Wright County Circuit Court Judge Craig Carter ultimately sided with Divine and the state. Divine also argued in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri in favor of a block of President Joe Biden’s proposed income-driven repayment plan for borrowers.

(ABC Kimberley: Ted O\\'Connor)Parent Kahri D\\'Este, whose two children are enrolled at a Genius centre in Conder in the ACT, said she is holding out hope that the centre stays open.\"If it goes under — which I honestly think is highly likely — then we will have no care,\" she said.\"We don\\'t have any other option, it\\'s not easy to get care here, everywhere has a waiting list for months.\"Ms D\\'Este said despite the ongoing threat of the centre suddenly shutting down, the \"amazing staff\" have kept her from walking away.\"I cannot believe that the educators, who have stuck through it this whole way, could just be dropped like hot potatoes,\" she said.\"There are so many good staff here, and they work their butts off, and they have been treated so badly.\"Childcare funder Finexia stung by $88m Genius debtThe administrators had intended to secure a new buyer by last week, but were still processing more than 400 enquiries from interested parties.The sale of the centres is intended to recoup the huge debts owed by companies in the Genius group, which currently stand at as much as $88 million and are forecast to grow as more creditors emerge.Potential buyers include Gold Coast-based Finexia, where Genius owner Darren Misquitta was until recently the biggest shareholder, but which has become embroiled in Genius\\'s financial downfall.ASX-listed Finexia was forced to freeze its childcare fund in February and last month revealed to investors that more than a fifth of the fund\\'s money was tied up in loans that were in default.Minutes from administrators\\' meetings with creditors reveal Finexia is chasing Genius over a loan worth more than $24 million, but Finexia has not formally informed investors of the dollar value of its loans to Genius.Finexia offers loans to childcare providers, and has provided funding to Genius.

I think this Labour government has a lot to offer, whether it be the employment rights bill, the increase in the minimum wage, the massive investment in our NHS, but people have heard the winter fuel allowance and the welfare cuts overwhelmingly.”Meanwhile, the Red Wall Group of Labour MPs who represent seats in the Midlands and north of England being targeted by Reform UK, demanded the government U-turn on winter fuel payments.In a statement posted on X, they said: “The prime minister has shown strong leadership internationally which must now be matched at home.“Responding to the issues raised by our constituents, including on winter fuel, isn’t weak, it takes us to a position of strength.”', 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Labour faces backlash over winter fuel cuts\\nENTITIES: Keir Starmer, Daily Mirror, Rachel Reeves, Louise Haigh, Red Wall Group, Reform UK\\nEVENT: The Daily Mirror criticized Keir Starmer's government for refusing to reverse cuts to winter fuel payments for pensioners, as Labour MPs also called for a change in policy.\\nCONTEXT: Labour party faces backlash over winter fuel cuts.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 48460, 'sourceId': 12420, 'url': 'https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/chemistry-of-the-papal-conclaves-black-and-white-smoke/', 'title': 'The Chemistry of the Papal Conclave’s Black and White Smoke', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T11:00:00.000Z', 'content': \"May 7, 20253 min readThe Pyrotechnic Chemistry of the Vatican’s Pope Smoke Signals ExplainedPyrotechnic chemistry drives the Vatican’s recipes for the black and white smoke used to announce papal election outcomesBy Meghan Bartels edited by Clara MoskowitzBlack smoke billows from the chimney on the roof of the Sistine Chapel indicating that the College of Cardinals have failed to elect a new Pope on March 13, 2013 in Vatican City, Vatican. Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesThe Vatican’s cardinals gather in conclave today to begin electing the successor to the late Pope Francis—which means the world’s attention is on a chimney attached to the Sistine Chapel. Here puffs of black smoke mark voting rounds that fail to converge on a winner until the cardinals announce that they have come to an agreement by releasing a plume of white smoke, the dramatic prelude to the unveiling of the new leader of the Roman Catholic world.Although the ritual may feel like something from another era, the papal conclave’s colored smoke signals only came into use in 1903, according to NBC News—a relatively recent development for a process that’s been going on for nearly a millennium. Historically, the signals have sometimes been ambiguous, but for recent elections, the Vatican has clearly consulted with scientific experts to ensure the Sistine Chapel’s chimney announces a clear verdict. Around the time of the 2013 conclave that elected Pope Francis, the Vatican published the ingredients of each smoke mix. (The Holy See Press Office did not respond to requests for confirmation that the same recipes remain in use this year.) Here’s the chemistry behind the conclave’s smoke announcements.On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

In combustion reactions, a fuel reacts with an oxygen-rich substance called an oxidizer, creating waste products that often include water and carbon dioxide.But the Vatican’s focus is the smoke, rather than the combustion that creates it. Smoke is made up of small particles suspended in air, says John Steinberg, a pyrotechnics expert. The smoke’s color is dictated by the particle color, which means white and black colored smoke result from waste products other than carbon dioxide, which is colorless. “You don’t want complete combustion because if we burn carbon completely, we get carbon dioxide,” he says.The solution, Steinberg explains, is to stop the reaction before the fuel is fully burned—a goal that can be accomplished by designing a reaction with more fuel than oxidizer and by lowering the temperature at which it occurs. These principles underlie both smokes produced by the Vatican conclave.When a round of voting is inconclusive, the conclave sends black smoke up through the chimney. Here the pyrotechnics at play are straightforward because black particles are simple to create—they result from most types of organic fuels. “Black smoke is the easiest” to make, Steinberg says.The 2013 recipe for black smoke consists of a mix of potassium perchlorate, anthracene and sulfur. In this reaction, potassium perchlorate is the oxygen-rich oxidizer, a role it frequently serves in fireworks because it is fairly safe and easily gives up its oxygen; anthracene is the fuel. But anthracene is relatively difficult to burn, Steinberg explains—hence the addition of a little sulfur. The sulfur melts at a low temperature, allowing the potassium perchlorate and anthracene to mix more thoroughly; sulfur also burns easily, encouraging the mixture to combust.White smoke from the roof of the Sistine Chapel indicating the election of Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio as Roman Pontiff with the name of Pope Francis I in Vatican City on March 13, 2013.Grzegorz Galazka/Mondadori Portfolio via Getty ImagesChemically speaking, white smoke is more challenging, Steinberg says. Some sources of white particles, such as zinc chloride or ammonium chloride, can be strongly irritating—which the Vatican seems to have wanted to avoid. Instead the 2013 recipe calls for potassium chlorate, the common sugar lactose and a type of pine resin sometimes known as Greek pitch.The first two ingredients are a common pair, Steinberg says: “Any pyrotechnician knows that if you want smoke, you start with potassium chlorate and sugar.” Potassium chlorate includes one fewer atom of oxygen per molecule than the potassium perchlorate used in black smoke and is an even stronger oxidizer—so strong it’s dangerous to use with combustion-prone sulfur. The powerful oxidizer is required in this case, however, because neither sugar nor pine resin are particularly eager to burn, Steinberg says.It’s the pine resin that lends the papal smoke its white hue. Pine resin is relatively rich in water and long chains of oxygen-containing hydrocarbons called carboxylic acids. Together the water and carboxylic acids ensure the combustion produces an artificial cloud of water vapor to herald the new pope. “That’s basically what this smoke is,” Steinberg says. “It’s a dense fog of water droplets.”\", 'location': 'VAT', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Chemistry of Papal Conclave Smoke Signals Explained\\nENTITIES: Vatican, Pope Francis, John Steinberg\\nEVENT: The article explains the chemistry behind the black and white smoke used during the papal conclave to signal the election of a new Pope, detailing the ingredients and chemical reactions involved.\\nCONTEXT: The Vatican uses specific chemical recipes for smoke signals.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 46943, 'sourceId': 884, 'url': 'https://news.sky.com/story/no-conflict-of-interest-in-appointing-labour-donor-as-football-regulator-chair-no-10-says-13363306', 'title': 'No conflict of interest in appointing Labour donor as football regulator chair, No 10 says', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T12:09:00.000Z', 'content': 'There was no conflict of interest in the incoming football regulator chair donating to Sir Keir Starmer\\'s Labour leadership campaign, Downing Street has said.Appearing before the Culture, Media and Sport select committee on Wednesday, David Kogan admitted he had donated \"very small sums of money\" to the leadership bids of Sir Keir and Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy in 2020.\\nPolitics latest: PM told to back Paddington BearMr Kogan told the pre-appointment hearing this hadn\\'t been discovered by the media, but he was \"happy to declare it now\".The media executive was nominated as chairman of the Independent Football Regulator last month, having initially been approached by the previous Conservative government.\\nMr Kogan insisted he had \"total personal independence from all of them\", saying he had \"never actually been particularly close to any of the individuals to whom I have donated money\".Louie French, the shadow minister for sport, has suggested there was a \"potential breach of the Governance Code on Public Appointments\" on this matter, saying it \"must urgently be investigated\".Mr French later told the Commons that Labour\\'s decision not to disclose these donations when Mr Kogan\\'s appointment was announced \"represents a clear discourtesy to both this House and the DCMS select committee\".\\nThis appointment may need a VAR check\\nJon Craig\\nChief political correspondent\\n@joncraig\\nDavid Kogan\\'s appointment seems like a case of obvious cronyism.\\nA bit like committing a bookable offence with the referee only yards away: the referee in this fixture being Dame Caroline Dineage, who chairs the culture, media and sport committee.\\nWill the MPs\\' decision now go into extra time?\\nTory MP Louie French wants to blow the whistle on his appointment, claiming it\\'s a breach of the code on public appointments.\\nFrench claims politics and sport shouldn\\'t mix.

The government gave in to a demand that when Indian workers are seconded to the UK on short-term visas, both they and their employers should be exempted from NICs for up to three years. They will make social security payments in India instead – and the reverse applies to British workers in India.The concession has been seized on by senior Tories, with Kemi Badenoch calling it “two-tier taxes”. Nigel Farage said Keir Starmer had “sold out British workers to the highest degree”. Critics have also raised questions about the deal’s implications for immigration and farming. But do their claims stack up?National insuranceThe NICs concession is expected to cost the exchequer about £100m in lost revenue, a government source told the Guardian.Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, told broadcasters on Wednesday that this was “less than a tenth” of the £1bn in additional tax revenue the deal is expected to bring, and that it would affect about 20,000 Indian workers currently in the UK.Farage has claimed that half a million Indians arrived in the UK over the past two years and that “this deal will throw the doors open even wider” and make it cheaper to hire Indian workers over British ones – but all this is misleading, as most Indians applying for jobs based in the UK will not benefit at all.In the grand scheme of government spending, £100m is small change, but ministers have so far refused to publish their assessment of the costs or impact the concession could have on the number of Indians who come to the UK temporarily on company transfers. This has fuelled speculation.Ministers have, however, pointed out that reciprocal tax agreements of this kind – which are called double contribution conventions and are intended to stop workers temporarily seconded abroad from being taxed twice – are not uncommon.The UK already has them with more than 50 countries, including the US, Canada and Japan. India has existing social security agreements with several European countries, such as Germany, France and the Netherlands.The issue was also on the table during the talks under the Conservatives while Badenoch was trade secretary. A senior Indian official told the Financial Times that the Tory leader was talking “rubbish” as she had agreed with the principle of exempting temporary Indian employees from NICs.Nonetheless, India’s boastful press release – calling the concession an “unprecedented achievement” that would “make Indian service providers significantly more competitive in the UK” – has made the politics of this awkward for the government.And the fact that Rachel Reeves raised national insurance contributions for employers in her budget, a tax rise that only kicked in last month, means the wider context for it is particularly damaging.Finally, the NICs issue was one of the longest-running sticking points in the trade talks and emerged as the final hurdle last week before negotiators agreed the deal. This demonstrates that it is a significant concession and one the government dug its heels in over.VisasThe fact that the deal does not include substantial numbers of extra visas for Indian workers – a key ask by Delhi in its trade negotiations – is a win.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionLabour has claimed that the Conservatives put visas on the table during their talks and that the current government secured a deal without changing its immigration policy.One existing visa route for yoga instructors, musicians and chefs to come to the UK will be opened to Indian applicants, but they will need to meet the usual salary and skills requirements. The route is capped at 1,800 visas a year.This is a long way from India’s initial demands, but that has not stopped Farage and some senior Tories from claiming the deal will lead to an influx of Indian immigrants.ServicesMajor service industries including the financial and legal sectors are not included in the deal, which has drawn criticism.In parallel with the trade deal, negotiators have been trying to strike a bilateral investment treaty with India, which would benefit the City of London. Rishi Sunak came close to finalising an agreement while he was prime minister last spring but wanted more for the services sector, which accounts for 80% of the economy.Given the impact of Donald Trump’s tariffs, however, Labour ministers decided it was worth getting the tariff-busting deal over the line by separating it from the investment treaty. It offers some benefits to the services sector, most significantly by opening up some Indian government procurement for British firms for the first time, but by and large, the deal cuts tariffs on goods.AgricultureThe deal will reduce UK import taxes on some Indian agricultural products, including frozen prawns. This has raised alarm about the implications for British farming.Officials have said the deal will benefit farmers by lifting India’s tariffs on British food exports, including lamb. Meanwhile, the UK is keeping tariffs in place on some agricultural products such as milled rice, where Indian exports could be damaging to British producers.', 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: UK-India trade deal sparks worker concerns\\nENTITIES: UK, India, Nigel Farage, Kemi Badenoch, Keir Starmer\\nEVENT: The UK-India trade deal includes a concession on national insurance contributions for Indian workers seconded to the UK, leading to criticism over potential disadvantages for British workers and concerns about immigration.\\nCONTEXT: Trade deal sparks debate over worker benefits and immigration.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 53030, 'sourceId': 12709, 'url': 'https://metro.co.uk/2025/05/07/psg-vs-arsenal-live-champions-league-latest-score-confirmed-lineups-dembele-benched-23043339/', 'title': 'PSG 2-1 Arsenal: Gunners out as Parisiens advance to Champions League final', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T17:00:00.000Z', 'content': 'Live\\nFULL-TIME: PSG 2-1 Arsenal (3-1 agg.)\\nGOAL!

Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said the group’s movements were negotiated with the government and further alleged that one of the six people who entered the Argentine ambassador’s residence in March left the compound in August, contradicting earlier statements from the opposition. Cabello’s statements came roughly 24 hours after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on social media that the opposition members were on U.S. soil after a “successful rescue.”The government of Argentine President Javier Milei allowed the six people into the ambassador’s residence when authorities loyal to Venezuela’s ruling party issued warrants for their arrest, accusing them of promoting acts of violence to destabilize the country. The group included the campaign manager and communications director of opposition leader Maria Corina Machado as well as Fernando Martinez, a cabinet minister in the 1990s. Martinez abandoned the compound in mid-December and, according to Venezuelan authorities, appeared before prosecutors. He died in February.After Rubio’s announcement Tuesday, Machado thanked people involved in what she called an “impeccable and epic operation for the Freedom of five heroes of Venezuela.” But Cabello alleged that only four people remained at the embassy after Martinez’s departure.Since late November, the group had denounced the constant presence of intelligence service agents and police outside the residence. It had also accused the government of President Nicolás Maduro of cutting electricity and water services to the compound. The government denied the allegations.“They put on their show, and in the end, they ended up negotiating,” Cabello said Wednesday during his weekly show on state television. Cabello did not offer details of the group's movements to reach the U.S. But he alleged that Machado negotiated with the government to allow her mother to leave the country, which he said she did so Monday via a commercial airplane headed to Colombia's capital, Bogota.Machado, who was last seen in public in January, did not immediately respond to Cabello's allegations. Maduro’s government routinely targeted its real or perceived opponents ahead of last year’s presidential election, and its crackdown on dissent only increased after the country’s National Electoral Council, which is stacked with Maduro loyalists, declared him the winner despite credible evidence to the contrary. The election results announced by the Electoral Council sparked protests across the country to which the government responded with force and ended with more than 20 people dead. They also prompted an end to diplomatic relations between Venezuela and various foreign countries, including Argentina.As Cabello's TV show aired, Machado's campaign manager, Magalli Meda, said on X that her home was being raided and shared timestamped photos showing men dressed in black, some with their faces covered and wearing bullet-proof vests, in a living room.“We denounce that at this moment, while Cabello lies about supposed negotiations for our departure, his repressive arm is violating our home in Caracas,” she said. “These images were obtained remotely just moments ago.” ___Garcia Cano reported from Mexico City.\", 'location': 'VEN', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Venezuela Denies Rescue; Opposition Home Raided\\nENTITIES: Venezuela, Diosdado Cabello, Marco Rubio, Javier Milei, Maria Corina Machado, Magalli Meda\\nEVENT: Venezuela denies international rescue operation of opposition members who had been sheltered in the Argentine diplomatic compound, claiming their departure was negotiated.

In addition, Pakistani jamming devices and electronic warfare equipment stopped some Indian missile launches and forced other planes to make emergency landings, he said.Image“Restraint is still being applied,” said Khawaja Muhammad Asif, Pakistan’s defense minister. “But if the same situation arises tonight, the situation could flare up very easily.”Credit...Waseem Khan/ReutersIndian officials and Western diplomats, as well as witnesses and local media, have said that two or three Indian planes went down on the Indian side of the border.“We could have taken down 10 planes yesterday,” Mr. Asif said. “We had the opportunity, but we restricted it to five planes and two U.A.V.s because we didn’t want to expand this situation.”Mr. Trump’s comments on Tuesday that he hopes the conflict “ends very quickly” were helpful, Mr. Asif said. He added that he would welcome further U.S. efforts to bring “down the temperature in the region.”Tensions between India and Pakistan have been spiraling since the terrorist attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir, in which gunmen killed 26 people, almost all Hindus.American diplomats have been in contact with Pakistani and Indian officials.

The Pakistani government has denied the sites had any connection with terrorist groups.Around midnight local time, India launched 78 planes to attack sites in Kashmir and Punjab, Mr. Asif said. The planes did not cross into Pakistan’s territory, he added.Mr. Asif said the Pakistani armed services reserved the right to strike at India if they detected the Indians were preparing for a further attack, but he also said Pakistan was ready to de-escalate.“Restraint is still being applied,” Mr. Asif said. “But if the same situation arises tonight, the situation could flare up very easily.”The defense minister reiterated his call for an international investigation and said he hoped U.S. officials would push India to accept such an inquiry.“The administration could suggest a commission of two or three other countries,” he said. “A credible body could be set up.

But Mr. Asif said he did not “foresee any risk, at the moment” of the dispute escalating to a nuclear conflict.The nuclear capabilities of the two countries, he said, were a stabilizing factor preventing disputes from escalating too much, but, he added, “the risk is always there.

What happens now?', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T08:15:00.000Z', 'content': 'In February, Germany held an election that had many echoes of the one the United States held in November. Voters were incensed with inflation — especially electricity prices, which surged 80 percent after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 and never returned to normal. Right-wing parties channeled that fury toward the incumbent government’s green policies, including the pioneering Energiewende decarbonization plan that has made renewable energy more than half of the electricity Germans use today.\\nWhile President Donald Trump has promised to stifle clean energy and bring a fossil fuel renaissance to the United States, Germany isn’t going that route. On Tuesday, Friedrich Merz of the Christian Democratic Union was sworn in as chancellor, leading a new conservative government in Berlin. The party has laid out policies that decelerate, but don’t reverse, the country’s blistering renewables build-out while easing up on the decarbonization push in buildings and industry.\\nThe goal: quickly reduce bills for households and businesses and reinvigorate the economy. Merz says German economic policy has been “almost exclusively geared toward climate protection,” according to Politico. “I want to say it as clearly as I mean it: We will and we must change that.”\\nHistorically, Europeans have been willing to shoulder the higher costs of aggressive climate and energy policies. But after three years of war in Ukraine, energy prices remain elevated — with household electricity rates still one-third above their prewar levels — frustrating consumers and raising fears of industrial collapse. European companies face electricity costs two to three times that of the U.S. and natural gas prices four to five times higher.\\nElections across the continent last year featured a “green backlash.” Politicians focused on voters’ biggest complaints — migration, the cost of living, a stagnant economy — and ignored climate. Dutch farmers revolted against a law to reduce air pollution; the Italian far right railed against a coming ban on conventional cars.\\nHowever, few interpret these developments as Europeans wanting to ditch the energy transition. In Germany, businesses say the Energiewende needs permitting and regulatory reforms and a greater focus on cost efficiency, not “a chainsaw.”\\nMichael Stiefel, a policy officer on people experiencing poverty with Diakonie Deutschland who advocates on behalf of low-income households, including those burdened by energy costs, said he never hears anyone express climate skepticism or opposition to clean energy. “Their main aim is to get to a minimum standard for their own lives,” he said, “a higher living style which would be stable and sufficient.”\\nThe Energiewende dates to the 1990s, when German leaders resolved to decarbonize the economy, starting with the grid. The plan was to transition from a power system centered on coal and nuclear power to one based on renewables — with natural gas being recruited later as an interim fuel. Germany lacks domestic gas reserves and relied heavily on Russia, which provided 40 percent of the European Union’s imported gas in 2021. Germans financed the wind and solar build-out through surcharges on utility bills.\\nThe program has remade the German power mix. About 22 gigawatts of coal and nuclear have been retired just since 2020, clearing the way for renewables’ surge. The power grid’s transformation is the main reason Germany’s emissions have fallen by half since the 1990s.\\nAfter invading Ukraine in 2022, Russia sharply reduced gas shipments to Europe, and electricity and fuel prices skyrocketed. In Germany, where three-quarters of buildings are heated by gas or oil, people shivered: In 2022, 5.5 million Germans felt they couldn’t afford to keep their homes warm.\\nEurope’s painful lesson: An energy transition without energy security is risky.\\n“Energy in my opinion is very geopolitical, and you always have to strive toward diversifying your energy resources,” said Kesavarthiniy Savarimuthu, who leads the European Power Markets team at BloombergNEF. “Somewhere along the line, it just seems like Europe forgot it was building its reliance on a sleeping bear.”\\nGermany has replaced most of its Russian gas with fuel from friendlier, if pricier, sources in Europe and the U.S. It also used the war as motivation to accelerate solar and wind build-outs: In 2021, it built 5.7 gigawatts of solar; in 2023, it added about 15 GW. But with 2.2 percent inflation still burdening many Germans, right-wing and far-right politicians had no trouble campaigning against the incumbent, center-left government last year. Merz called wind turbines “ugly” and promised policy “for the majority who can think straight … and not for any green and left-wing nutcases.”\\nIn April, Merz’s party announced a coalition with other governing partners and laid out its policy plan for the next five years. Some climate advocates read the blueprint with relief, as it stopped short of torching many of Germany’s long-term climate targets, such as achieving net-zero by 2045 and phasing out coal by 2038.\\nMerz says his guiding light for energy policy is not climate but “competitiveness.” Taxes and fees on power bills are part of why Germans have some of the most expensive electricity in Europe, according to the International Energy Agency. The new coalition promises to ease these charges so electricity rates drop at least 5 euro cents per kilowatt-hour; that’s about an eighth of the rate the average German household currently pays.\\nThe coalition agreement says it wants to keep developing all renewable energy sources, but with an emphasis on compatibility with the grid. Power companies have complained that in the rush to hit its renewables targets, Germany has often built solar and wind farms in remote or hard-to-reach places, resulting in higher costs. Geographic mismatches — for example, brisk wind energy in the north not being able to reach customers in the industrial south — mean that electricity prices can spike in one region even as they go below zero in another.\\nA worker installs solar panels in 2023 at the construction site of a new solar energy park as wind turbines spin in the background. Sean Gallup / Getty Images\\nMore controversially, the new government has proposed building 20 gigawatts of natural gas generation by 2030; the whole German power system stands at about 260 GW. Solar and wind are now the cheapest energy sources in most of the world, but they’re still prone to wild swings in productivity — in December, Germany’s wind output fell 85 percent below normal. Merz is sympathetic to energy-industry arguments that new gas plants can mitigate such eventualities. He’s also proposing to clear red tape for energy storage, which plays a minimal role today but could theoretically serve the same balancing role.\\nA likely target of the Merz government is the country’s building energy law, which outlaws most new fossil fuel heating systems in buildings starting in 2028. Inflation has left many people unable or unwilling to pay the upfront costs for electric systems like heat pumps — an unpopularity that conservatives exploited in the campaign.\\nSo what, if anything, can be learned from Germany’s experience?\\nRenewables are cheap, but bills often don’t reflect that\\nIn principle, renewable energy should lower electric bills. Solar and wind are inexpensive to build, and their fuel is free.\\nIn practice, the savings often don’t reach consumers. Ratepayers must cover the cost of integrating renewables into the grid, and paying for new transmission lines and the backup systems needed to balance nature’s flutters. Conservatively, Germany needs to invest 500 billion euros (about $565 billion) over the next two decades just to upgrade the power grid, estimates Deutsche Bank. These should be one-time investments, but during inflationary times, it’s understandable if people wonder what they’re paying for.\\nWorse, many European countries that have greatly expanded renewable energy including Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Germany nevertheless tend to base power rates on the price of gas. A recent report on European competitiveness said this is a structural flaw, arguing countries should reform pricing so consumers benefit more directly from clean energy.\\nGreen energy is cheap … eventually\\nThe good news: Both the U.S. and Europe have made significant headway in decarbonizing their power sectors. The bad: The transportation, buildings, and industrial sectors remain, and the alternative technologies are much less mature. The sticker shock associated with electric cars, hydrogen furnaces, and heat pumps contributed to last year’s green backlash in Europe.\\nStill, energy experts argue that electrifying more of the economy eventually lowers costs overall. “If you do this you can really go to a very sustainable, pretty cheap, and high-performance energy system. That’s actually the goal,” said Gunnar Luderer, who leads the Energy Transition Lab at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.\\nHe said China is moving in this direction. For example, it recently launched a pilot project in nine cities to see if their growing fleets of electric cars can provide battery storage for the system. Recent trends in the Western world raise the question of whether voters are willing to make these kinds of investments.\\nIn Germany, buildings have to pay a carbon tax that rises over time. Germany’s previous government promised to create a fund to help citizens manage these price increases — to the tune of several hundred Euros per year — but cut it for budget reasons, leaving the public with all stick and no carrot. Europeans remain broadly supportive of their governments’ climate policies, but it’s “increasingly clear that this support could fade if the transition is not fair and citizens are left to shoulder the costs on their own,” said a recent report by E3G, a think tank.\\nWhile some governments have sent money to households during crises to help them pay bills, others are tackling the issue at a deeper level. E3G said Bulgaria, Croatia, Italy, Denmark, and Poland have all expanded incentives to make homes more energy-efficient — which could not just save citizens money, but help them weather the next crisis.', 'location': 'DEU', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Germany adjusts energy policy amid 'green backlash'\\nENTITIES: Germany, Friedrich Merz, Christian Democratic Union, Energiewende, Russia, Ukraine\\nEVENT: Germany's conservative government is adjusting its energy policies to address high electricity prices and economic competitiveness, while still maintaining long-term climate targets.\\nCONTEXT: Germany's energy transition faces challenges due to rising costs and geopolitical factors, leading to policy adjustments.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 48191, 'sourceId': 13, 'url': 'https://www.rt.com/news/616941-pakistan-threatents-retaliation-india/', 'title': 'Pakistan vows retaliation for Indian cross-border attacks', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T13:54:31.000Z', 'content': 'Pakistan has accused India of killing civilians in a cross-border military operation overnight and promised a forceful response.

Each flag also includes the sego lily, a city symbol and Utah’s state flower.ImageNew city flags were adopted by Salt Lake City in response to a recent state law.Credit...Salt Lake City Mayor's OfficeIn Boise, the City Council designated the rainbow Pride flag and a flag promoting organ donation as official city flags.“The City of Boise will continue to fly the flags on City Hall Plaza that represent our community and speak to our values of caring for people and welcoming all,” Lauren McLean, Boise’s mayor, said in a statement before the resolution was adopted.The Utah legislature passed a law in March banning the display of flags that are not explicitly approved at public schools and government buildings. (Flags allowed under the state law include the American flag, the state flag, city flags, flags of other countries or states, and college and military flags.)Gov. Spencer Cox of Utah, a Republican, allowed the measure to become law without his signature, saying that he was concerned it was too sweeping but that he recognized a veto would be overridden. The law did not explicitly mention L.G.B.T.Q. or Pride flags, but sponsors of the bill indicated that barring such flags was a major part of their motivation.Earlier this year, Idaho also banned displaying unofficial flags at government buildings.ImageMayor Erin Mendenhall of Salt Lake City supported the city’s new flags.Credit...Niki Chan Wylie for The New York TimesMayor Erin Mendenhall of Salt Lake City, a Democrat, said in a statement that the new flags promoted unity. “I want all Salt Lakers to look up at these flags and be reminded that we value diversity, equity and inclusion,” she said, “leaving no doubt that we are united as a city and people, moving forward together.”In response to Salt Lake City’s action on Tuesday, the Utah House speaker, Mike Schultz, a Republican, said in a statement to The Salt Lake Tribune: “Salt Lake City’s move to bypass state law is a clear waste of time and taxpayer resources.”He added: “Salt Lake City should focus on real issues, not political theatrics.”A state senator, Daniel McCay, mocked the city’s action by posting photos on social media of flags that, along with Salt Lake City’s sego lily, displayed a symbol of the Mormon Church, the design of the flag of Israel and President Trump’s “MAGA” slogan.A similar state bill in Florida that would have barred flags expressing a “political viewpoint” failed to advance at the recently concluded legislative session.Victor Mather, who has been a reporter and editor at The Times for 25 years, covers sports and breaking news.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\", 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Cities adopt Pride flags, challenge state laws\\nENTITIES: Salt Lake City, Boise, Utah, Idaho, Lauren McLean, Erin Mendenhall, Mike Schultz, Daniel McCay\\nEVENT: Salt Lake City and Boise adopted official Pride flags in response to Utah and Idaho passing laws barring unofficial flags from being displayed on government property.\\nCONTEXT: Cities adopt Pride flags after states ban unofficial flags.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 47920, 'sourceId': 1, 'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/clyqy0q0ezmo', 'title': 'India-Pakistan: Airports closed, eerie silence in Indian-administered Kashmir', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T09:01:29.000Z', 'content': 'In Srinagar in Indian-administered Kashmir, a road, normally busy with tourists and travellers, lies deserted.All flights in and out of the region\\'s main city have been suspended for civilians and the airport is reserved for military use only.Many locals have been hiding inside bunkers and some have fled the area to find safer ground.Indian officials say that they \"destroyed terror camps\" in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir through air strikes on Wednesday.

The evidence shows the UK is a hub for pioneering research, with one in eight trials testing humans for the first time, and cutting-edge treatments such as gene therapies becoming a new growth area.But a review of the data by the Guardian found that women were significantly under-represented. Both sexes were included in most trials (90%), but male-only trials (6.1%) were nearly twice as common as female-only studies (3.7%). Pregnant and breastfeeding women were especially under-represented – involved in just 1.1% and 0.6% of trials respectively.Women’s health experts expressed alarm over the figures, which they said meant women and their doctors were having to make decisions about whether to take a drug in a “vacuum of evidence”. Some areas of research are dominated by men at all levels – funders, researchers, consultants and patients – and as a result there could be a “reluctance” to fund female-only trials, the experts added.Dr Amy Brenner, an assistant professor in the clinical trials unit at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), said: “It is particularly concerning that there are more male-only trials than female-only trials as, while they may be disease-specific, it is certainly not true that there are more male-only than female-only diseases.”The gender gap had serious implications, Brenner said. “This under-representation means there is a lack of evidence on the safety and effectiveness of many interventions in women.” There was an “urgent need” to correct the disparity in order to improve women’s health outcomes, she added.Beyond the under-representation of women in general, the absence of pregnant and breastfeeding women in UK clinical trials was also “problematic”, Brenner said. This may be in part because of safety concerns and a “likely reluctance” to put babies at risk, she said. “However, without trials in these populations these women will continue to miss out on possible beneficial treatments”The Guardian reviewed the data from a study led by the MHRA and the University of Liverpool, which collected details of all 4,616 clinical trials submitted to the MHRA between 2019 and 2023.Cancer trials dominated, making up nearly a third of all studies, but other major conditions lagged behind. Heart disease – the world’s biggest killer – received just 5.2% of research focus. Reproductive and childbirth trials made up only 2.2% of the total.Trials for conditions such as chronic pain, respiratory conditions and mental health disorders were among the least common, despite their significant impact on public health.Patients aged 65 or above made up 67.7% of participants. Cutting-edge treatments, such as gene and cell therapies, represent a growing focus of research efforts but still represent only 3.4% of trials, despite their potential to transform care for patients with limited treatment options.The Guardian found the number of male-only trials (282) was 67% higher than female-only trials (169), and pregnant and breastfeeding women took part in only about one in 100 medical studies.Prof Anna David, the director of the EGA Institute for Women’s Health at UCL, said the “important” findings helped explained why so few new treatments for women’s health issues were emerging, and why some women “are not getting the care they need”.“There is this perception that women, pregnant women and breastfeeding women do not want to participate in clinical trials and therefore they are usually not considered as potential participants, even in phase 3 clinical trials. This is not the case.”She added: “Women and their healthcare providers are therefore having to make decisions about whether to take a drug in a vacuum of evidence, which is not ethical.”David was especially concerned that only 2.2% of trials focused on reproductive and childbirth issues. “Pregnancy conditions such as pre-eclampsia, preterm labour, and placental insufficiency leading to foetal growth restriction are major diseases with no current treatments,” she said.Prof Andrea Manfrin, the MHRA’s deputy director of clinical investigations and trials, said there was a “notable imbalance” between male-only and female-only trials. “When specific groups are not adequately represented in trials, it creates evidence gaps about how medicines work for them.”The MHRA was working with trial sponsors, researchers and ethics committees to promote studies that “better reflect” the population, she said. “Increasing diversity in clinical trials is a priority for us at the MHRA. We are committed to supporting inclusive, safe and scientifically robust research across the UK.”Brenner said the key to increasing the number of female-only trials, and the number of women taking part in trials more generally, was involving more women in the early stages of their design.“In the LSHTM clinical trials unit we plan all trials with patient and public involvement, involving patients, carers and the public in designing and running trials,” he said. “Ensuring strong representation from women in these groups is a first step to understanding barriers and increasing women’s participation in trials.”The health minister Karin Smyth said the government was determined to make the UK a world leader in life sciences, developing groundbreaking new treatments “focused on the conditions that matter most to patients”.

It was pouring with rain, her baby was asleep, and she suddenly thought: “I have no one to talk to, and nothing to talk about.” She had given birth in November 2024, aged 27, and went from being a manager in a busy office, to being at home with her baby, which she had been looking forward to. “That first month, you’re exhausted, but the 4am feeds feel sacred,” she told HuffPost UK.“Then, the weeks roll on, and every kiss goodbye to my partner as he left for work felt like a countdown until he was back home. I began to feel drained, physically and emotionally – and, without meaning to, I started to withdraw.“It felt like people only wanted to see me for the baby. I didn’t feel like people wanted to see me anymore or talk about anything but my child.”Heidi, who lives in Dorset with her partner and their baby, describes feeling like she lost her old self after giving birth. And it was during that quiet moment at the start of 2025 that she realised what was happening: she was lonely. “I felt like I shouldn’t talk to anyone ... that I just had to get on with it,” she said.Most mums have experienced loneliness – and struggled in silenceHeidi’s not alone in her experience. New research from networking app Peanut found 94% of mothers have experienced loneliness, which begins in pregnancy and peaks after giving birth (75% of mothers experienced difficulty during the first three months postpartum).Adelle Cunningham found out she was expecting twins in May 2023. During a routine scan in December that year, she was told her babies needed to be delivered by emergency C-section due to placental abruption – where the placenta separates from the uterus early.Her twins were born six weeks premature, and spent their first few weeks in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). “This was a very lonely experience because it felt like the whole world was against me,” said Adelle, who is 27. “I left the hospital every night and would cry my eyes out in the car knowing we were leaving without our babies.”Almost four weeks later, her babies Kian and Kylah were allowed home. One week later, the family moved to a new village in Cambridgeshire.She recalled: “I knew no one. I felt like an alien. I do feel this contributed to my loneliness because I didn’t have any local friends to meet up with.“I was too scared to attend a baby group with the twins due to anxiety and none of my friends or family were round the corner which is what I’ve known my whole life.”It wasn’t until her babies were six months old when she realised she was experiencing loneliness. Her daughter had been having choking episodes which weren’t related to eating or drinking. It later transpired they were linked to an undiagnosed allergy.Justin Paget via Getty Images“One episode became so severe I had to perform CPR on my six-month-old daughter, and that day still haunts me,” Adelle said. “I realised I was lonely after this happened when I felt I couldn’t reach out to anyone with my worries.”Eventually, she opened up about how she was feeling to her partner. She didn’t explicitly say that what she was experiencing was loneliness, but did admit she wasn’t feeling good.“He was, of course, reassuring and everything I needed,” she said. “I didn’t want to open up to family and friends because I didn’t want them to feel disappointed, which I look back now and realise how silly that is – but that’s the reality of loneliness.”Why aren’t parents talking about it more?There is a shame that lingers when it comes to loneliness and admitting you’re struggling after having a baby. Around half (51%) of mums surveyed by Peanut reported feeling deep shame, and 75% said loneliness affected their mental health.What’s more, 43% have never shared their feelings, with 62% fearing they’d burden others and 59% thinking they should just “get on with it”.Heidi recalled: “I mentioned it in passing to my health visitor, and she told me that loneliness wasn’t something I had to just accept – that I deserved to feel more connected.“That conversation was a turning point. I realised: I need to tell people how I’m feeling.”She posted on Peanut and was flooded with responses from other mums who felt the same. “After this, I started to talk to my partner, my friends, my family. And almost immediately, I felt less alone,” she said. “I’d been afraid of being judged or labelled a ‘bad mum’ just because I found some parts of motherhood mundane or boring, which I now know is completely normal.”To coincide with Maternal Mental Health Awareness Week (5-12 May), statues across London have been adorned with “forced smiles” as part of a campaign by Peanut, Tommee Tippee and the Maternal Mental Health Alliance.Peanut’s CEO Michelle Kennedy said: “Motherhood is the ultimate “Insta vs reality” moment – and mothers feel that they should be so happy to have a healthy baby that their feelings should be put on the back burner.“The lack of conversation in this space means that 76% of mums told us they were surprised that having kids was so isolating, which is largely due to the silence that surrounds this topic overall.“This forced happiness is also making the situation far worse, as many don’t realise that others are masking their true feelings too.”What can help mums who are struggling?For Heidi, it’s imperative that there are better support systems for mothers, as well as more honest antenatal conversations, and accessible postnatal mental health checks.“Looking back, my experience could easily have turned into postnatal depression,” she said. “And for many mums, it does.”For Adelle, it shouldn’t be just on mums to solve the problem. She suggested regular check-ins from family and friends can help, as can reassurance from medical professionals.Social media can also be a lifeline, enabling mums to reach out to arrange playdates or, if that feels overwhelming, a simple meet-and-walk around a nearby park. Adelle agrees with Heidi that more postnatal check-ups are needed. “After giving birth, I had my six week check-up and that was it,” she said. “I was shocked by this because it was months later that I felt lonely and started experiencing symptoms of PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder).”Heidi concluded: “We need to make it easier to reach out, speak honestly, and let go of the guilt that comes with needing support.“Wanting connection shouldn’t come with apology. Asking for help should feel human – not like a failure – because we were never meant to do this alone.”For more information or to access mental health support, visit the Maternal Mental Health Alliance’s Information Centre at maternalmentalhealthalliance.org/parents and find community on the Peanut App.Help and support:Mind, open Monday to Friday, 9am-6pm on 0300 123 3393.Samaritans offers a listening service which is open 24 hours a day, on 116 123 (UK and ROI - this number is FREE to call and will not appear on your phone bill).CALM (the Campaign Against Living Miserably) offer a helpline open 5pm-midnight, 365 days a year, on 0800 58 58 58, and a webchat service.The Mix is a free support service for people under 25.

Usually it\\'s relatively easy to find – and workers are given a white slip of paper with details of where to go and when to show up. But on Tuesday morning, many left empty-handed. \"Less volume of cargo containers means less work for us,\" said longshore worker Charlie Camacho. His job typically consists of loading and unloading shipping containers. \"So we feel it, we definitely feel it,\" he said.\\nTogether these two ports comprise an extremely busy port complex – the Port of Los Angeles alone is the busiest in the Western Hemisphere. But in the month or so since tariffs against Chinese goods ratcheted up – port officials here have been predicting a drop in cargo. This week, they announced it was down 35% compared to the same week last year. The immediate impact of the cargo decline affects virtually every business around the ports: trucking, shipping, distribution centers, and others. But port officials say this downturn will soon be felt much more broadly – by manufacturers and retailers around the country, as well as consumers. Volume down, local businesses suffering\\xa0 In 2024, approximately 31% of everything that came into or out of the U.S. in shipping containers over water, came through this port complex. Last year, the ports handled 19.9 million of those containers – but it\\'s likely to be less in 2025. Camacho, whose family has worked at the ports for three generations, spoke with pride about working as part of this system. \"My grandmother was one of the first women to work at the ports,\" he said. \"I sometimes think I am doing this for her.\"\\nWhen asked about his chances of finding work on Tuesday, he was not optimistic – \"Ah man, like 25 percent, maybe,\" he responded. He ultimately left the dispatch office with no gig. It\\'s not just longshore workers who are being affected – a dip in cargo affects a huge ecosystem of businesses that are connected to the importing and exporting of goods in Southern California. Frank Groves is an independent salesman who makes his money selling gloves and safety gear to port workers. He was also at the dispatch hall on Tuesday, trying to find customers – but he says business has dropped nearly 75 percent in recent weeks.\\n\"No sales at all really.

The port lists furniture, auto parts, apparel and electronics among their top imports.\\n\"You name it, they all come through our ports,\" Di Constanzo said. According to Seroka, big importers say shoppers could start to see shortages in four to six weeks, once inventory that was stockpiled ahead of the tariffs runs out. He says they also may start to see significant price hikes. Long-term concerns Even if the increased tariffs go away, some of these problems could persist for a while, said Diane Middleton. She\\'s a former Los Angeles City Harbor Commissioner who has been working with the ports for more than 50 years.\\n\"You don\\'t just have ships lined up like taxi cabs,\" she said. \"You have to reserve vessels. You have to specify a time. Once you\\'ve cut all that off, you can\\'t bring it back in a minute.\"\\nAnd in the long term, she added, decades-old trade patterns may be permanently changed.

Limited time offer.It was a bizarre set of circumstances prompted by the knock-on effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a frantic reshuffling of drivers resulting in him co-driving a Tickford Mustang with James Courtney.It was the day of his 18th birthday when he put in a series of clean shifts to secure 10th place on his first outing.It immediately put him on a trajectory to a full-time drive at Triple Eight, with which he made his main-game debut in 2022.Now he’s preparing to raise the bat.“It goes very fast,” Feeney says. “To think that I’ve done nearly 100 races now is pretty wild.”His first race as a series protagonist came with considerable hype thanks to his sparkling junior career that boasted titles in Super3 and Super2.Supercars legend Mark Skaife described his debut as the most anticipated since Craig Lowndes in 1996.Matching Lowndes’s rookie championship was always going to be a tall order, with the sport having become far more specialised and rewarding of experience since then.Unsurprisingly most of Feeney’s first season was more workmanlike that spectacular until he scored his first victory at the season-closing race at the Adelaide 500, holding off immense pressure from Walkinshaw Andretti United’s Chaz Mostert to score a gritty and determined victory.Suddenly parallels of a different kind were being drawn.Jamie Whincup also had an understated start to his main-game career — perhaps too understated given he was sacked by Garry Rogers Motorsport after his first full-time season — but upon returning to the grid in 2005 showed signs of being the weapon he would eventually become.His first race win, in 2006, was also on Sunday at the Adelaide 500. Like Feeney, he started from third, and like Feeney, he beat a Holden Racing Team entry — in this case Todd Kelly — in the years before that team later became WAU.Of course the stats book isn’t the only intersection between their careers.PIT TALK PODCAST: Oscar Piastri wins his fourth race in five grands prix to extend his lead atop the drivers championship, and with McLaren scoring its biggest victory yet, is there any hope for anyone else in either title chase?Feeney was Whincup’s successor at Triple Eight when the seven-time champion stepped up into the team principal role, and the pair now race together every season as endurance co-drivers, the highlight being their victory at the 2023 Sandown 500.In Feeney’s rapid rise from promising rookie to championship contender and, this weekend, centurion, the importance of Whincup’s influence cannot be understated.“It’s been huge, and I think really what helped my progression at the end of 2022 and into 2023 was working with Jamie,” Feeney says.“Every year come the end of the year I work with him and we all raise to another bar, and hence we end years really strongly.“I don’t want to reel off 10 races [as highlights], but the Sandown win with J Dub is right up there with Adelaide.“It’s always super fun working with him. I love it. Just being able to work with him shows me the level that he operates at, and I think a lot of that washed off onto me in the first year or two of working with him.“Now it’s set me up on my own path.“The first six months of racing he was settling into the job with the boss, but when he puts the race suit on and jumps in the car, being able to learn off him on those two weekends of the year is probably the most value I can get.“It’s been awesome. I love working with him every year. I’m stoked that he’s back.“For me the big one’s getting Bathurst with him. I obviously haven’t won Bathurst, and he hasn’t won it I think in over 10 years now, so I’m pretty keen to try and get one with him.”Whincup isn’t alone as a key backer of the now 22-year-old rise through the ranks.Doohan dropped! Franco joins Alpine | 00:32“There are so many; It’s hard to reel off a few,” he said.“If it wasn’t for Roland [Dane], I probably wouldn’t have had a full-time gig at Red Bull. Between him and Paul Morris, they were the ones that got the ball rolling to get me in at Triple Eight.“There’s Marty, my engineer. He’s done 99 of those races with me, so to be able to do it with him … I think for both of us to tick that off, to come in as young guys and do pretty well in our first few years has been awesome.“Even just working with Shane [van Gisbergen] for two years — I’m so lucky at Triple Eight. Everyone there’s won races and championships and has got so much experience, so to come in as a rookie into that environment has just been awesome for me.“I can’t just pick some person because the whole team is so important to me.”His victory at the Adelaide 500 stands as his career highlight to date, coming on a weekend imbued with meaning as the final race for the storied Holden Commodore. Feeney will always be the last driver to win with that iconic marque.“I think that’s one that will probably always be the most important in my career,” he says.But Feeney’s eyes remain forwards. His 100th race is still to be run, and there’s only one thing on his mind.“I won my 50th, so hopefully I can win my 100th,” he says. “[My 50th] was in Darwin. I’ve had a good run in Darwin in the past, and they gave me a cake with 50 on it, hence why I remember it!“I doubt I’ll get a cake, but hopefully I’ll can get a win on my 100th.”', 'location': 'AUS', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Feeney celebrates 100th race, credits Whincup\\nENTITIES: Broc Feeney, Jamie Whincup, Triple Eight, Mark Skaife, Craig Lowndes, Roland Dane, Paul Morris, Shane van Gisbergen\\nEVENT: Broc Feeney is set to race his 100th Supercars race at the Tasmania Super 440, reflecting on his career and the influence of Jamie Whincup and others at Triple Eight.

A Republican state representative called Stan Gerdes recently filed a bill called the Forbidden Unlawful Representation of Roleplaying in Educational Spaces (FURRIES) Act, which would ban schoolkids from acting like animals. No hissing during history, no meowing during maths, and absolutely no relieving yourself in a litter box during lunch break, according to the FURRIES Act.Are animal impersonations a serious issue in Texas’s schools? Gerdes insists so, noting in a press release that he had heard reports of a “furry-related incident” in at least one school. When pressed on the issue, however, he was unable to provide any actual evidence of schools providing litter boxes for students who identify as felines.This, of course, is because there aren’t any examples. Nevertheless, the myth that schools are hotbeds of cat-litter-based activity has been circulating for years, amplified by numerous Republicans and conservative influencers. I should note that, having investigated the matter back in 2022, NBC News was able to find one example of a school that had cat litter in its classrooms. But you know why that was? It was part of an emergency supply kit in case kids were locked in a classroom for an extended amount of time during a school shooting. There were 56 school shootings in the US last year, by the way. Furries weren’t responsible for any of them.I am sure there are people out there so indoctrinated by Fox News and internet brain-rot that they sincerely believe teachers are trying to turn innocent schoolchildren into cats. But I highly doubt Gerdes is one of them. Rather, this all seems to be a cynical attempt to attack public (state) schools and justify defunding them. Tellingly, Texas governor Greg Abbott referenced the FURRIES Act during a recent speech in which he was trying to promote a bill (which has now passed) that would allow for taxpayer money to be used to help certain students pay for private school tuition.Distracting your gullible voters with culture war nonsense so you can pass legislation that will make the rich richer and hurt the most vulnerable?

North Advisors, puts Nigel Farage’s party slightly ahead of Labour as the second-largest political party at Holyrood.According to the poll, the SNP would remain, by far, the biggest group in the Parliament, with 33% on the constituency vote and 29% on the regional vote.Reform UK came second with 19% on the constituency vote and 20% on the list vote.John Swinney’s party would lose a handful of seats, the poll suggested, but would remain, by far, Holyrood’s biggest party (Jane Barlow/PA)PA WireLabour was close behind with 19% on the first-past-the-post vote but fell slightly with 18% on the regional ballot.The Tories were on 11% and 12% respectively while the Liberal Democrats were on 11% and 10%.The Greens came in behind at 5% and 9% while Alba was last with 1% and 3% respectively.According to polling expert Professor Sir John Curtice, the survey would see the SNP fall to 58 seats while Reform would be in second place with 21 seats.That would make the party the Scottish Parliament’s main opposition in the event the SNP formed the next government.According to the poll, Russell Findlay’s Tories would slip from its current place as the main opposition to the fourth biggest party in Holyrood (Jane Barlow/PA)PA WireLabour would place third again with 18 seats while the Tories would slip from Holyrood’s second biggest party to its fourth with just 13 seats.Under the seat projection, the LibDems would increase its seat count to 10 while the Greens would stay at eight.A total of 65 seats are needed to form a majority government in the Scottish Parliament.A slim majority would vote to stay in the UK, the poll also found, with 51% opting for No and 49% for Yes.“After its success in last week’s English local elections,\\xa0Reform now pose a significant threat to the Conservatives’ and Labour’s prospects at Holyrood too,” Sir John said.“More than one in four of those who voted Conservative in last year’s Westminster election and nearly one in five of those who backed Labour have now switched to Reform.“As a result, Reform’s poll rating in Scotland has risen to 20% for the first time and the party is now a serious competitor for the position of principal opposition party at Holyrood.”Polling expert John Curtice said the poll would be ‘good news’ for John Swinney because Reform splits the unionist vote (Strathclyde University/PA)PA MediaThe University of Strathclyde professor said the “fracturing of the unionist vote” in Scotland would be “good news” for the First Minister.He said: “Even though the party’s share of the vote is now well down on May 2021, it could still win the bulk of Holyrood’s first past the post seats and, as a result, be left with only a little short of its current tally of MSPs at Holyrood.“Crucially, the fragmentation of Scotland’s politics could help ease the path towards another pro-independence majority at Holyrood at a time when, still, almost half of Scotland would like to leave the UK.”Fergus Mutch, True North’s managing partner, said: “A year out from a Holyrood election, our latest poll presents a fascinating set of results.“The SNP remains, by some distance, the largest party but will have to look to other parties for the support needed to secure a working majority.“The party of independence will, however, be asking itself why its electoral support lags so far behind the 49% of voters who wish to see Scotland go it alone.“Reform UK, buoyed by their recent success in English local elections, are nipping at Labour’s heels on the constituency vote in Scotland and now a nose ahead on the list.“Converting these figures into seats, we’re at a tipping point where they emerge as the second party in Scottish politics heading into a May 2026 election – representing a significant breakthrough north of the border.“Anas Sarwar continues to struggle to catch a break – with the woes of his party at a UK level reflecting on his support in Scotland – and Reform UK nibbling away at enough of his vote share to prove a problem for him.“The Conservatives, meanwhile, are being monstered by Reform and are at risk of tumbling from second to fourth place in Scottish politics.”Some 1,020 people aged 16 or over were polled between May 2 and 5 for the survey.Commenting afterwards, Reform\\xa0councillor for Shettleston, Thomas Kerr, said: “As all political parties gear up towards Holyrood 2026, Reform UK does so with a spring in our step and passion in our hearts.“We know Scotland is broken and those SNP and Labour politicians who broke it will be held accountable next year. There’s a lot of ground to cover, a lot of scrutiny to come but Reform UK is ready for the challenge ahead.“To our opponents, we say, bring it. Scotland badly needs real fundamental change and only Reform UK will fix the mess the mainstream establishment parties have created.“As today’s Survation poll shows, Reform UK is the only political party in Scotland with momentum and now the clear opposition to this rotten SNP Government.”', 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Reform UK gains ground in Scotland poll\\nENTITIES: Reform UK, SNP, Labour, Conservatives, Nigel Farage, John Swinney, John Curtice, Fergus Mutch, Thomas Kerr\\nEVENT: A Survation poll suggests Reform UK would become the second-largest party in the Scottish Parliament if an election were held, ahead of Labour but behind the SNP.

Itoje is set to become the first Englishman to lead the Lions in 24 years when he is unveiled as part of Andy Farrell’s squad announcement at a live event at the O2.Itoje, also the England captain, became overwhelming favourite for the role when it emerged Caelan Doris had suffered a shoulder injury last weekend that required surgery. The Ireland captain is now a doubt for the tour, clearing the way for Itoje to be selected as captain and lead what is understood to be a 40-strong squad.The 30-year-old lock is set for his third Lions tour, having excelled as the youngest member of the 2017 squad against New Zealand. He was also among the standout players in the Covid-hit series defeat by South Africa in 2021 and has started the last five Lions Tests.The then England captain Owen Farrell was selected for the tour of South Africa but he was the first since 2005 with Steve Borthwick (2009), Chris Robshaw (2013) and Dylan Hartley (2017) all overlooked. Itoje is set to break the recent mould, however, and become the first English Lions captain since Martin Johnson led his second consecutive tour in 2001.Itoje has been earmarked as a leader ever since he broke on to the international scene, having captained England Under-20s to the junior World Cup title in 2014. It was only this season that he was installed as Saracens captain, however, while on the eve of the Six Nations he was promoted to England captain by Borthwick, replacing clubmate Jamie George.Under his leadership, England lost their opening Six Nations match against Ireland but have won their past four in succession, prompting Borthwick to endorse Itoje’s credentials as the Lions captain. Borthwick said: “I think Maro’s been absolutely outstanding. He leads by example and he’s stepped up his game. He’s improved in many areas in this campaign. I’d be fully confident in Maro to lead the Lions should Andy ask him.”Only the Lions captain finds out of their selection before Thursday’s live event where the chair, Ieuan Evans, will read out the list of Farrell’s squad in front of what organisers hope will be around 2,000 paying spectators. As of earlier this week, a number of tickets – costing £65 a head – remained unsold for an event that can be streamed for free.Farrell and his assistant coaches, meanwhile, convened on Wednesday for a final selection meeting with a number of injury headaches, including Doris, to contend with. Of the 40 players he is expected to select, 22 are set to be forwards. Four years ago Warren Gatland initially selected 37 players but did not have a midweek match between the first and second Tests to contend with as the Lions do this year.On Wednesday night, as this year’s captain, Itoje was due to attend a dinner with a host of former players who have previously held the role including Johnson, Sam Warburton and Brian O’Driscoll.This week, the Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall, gave a glowing appraisal of Itoje’s captaincy credentials.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotion“He has thrived on the England captaincy as well and he played really well in the Six Nations, but he has played even better for us since then,” said McCall, who believes the second row is in the best form of his career.“Maro is very much a leader by what he does and how consistent he is. He is playing as well as he has ever played, so if he is chosen to be captain the good news is that he’s right on top of his game at the moment and he’s as fit as he can be. Maro is somebody who delegates when he needs to. He makes sure that when he speaks, people are going to listen because what he says is important,” McCall added.“He is very, very good at using some of the senior players around him and of course on any Lions trip there are going to be lots of good leaders.

The cardinals, the most ever to gather in a papal conclave, will retire to guest quarters at the Vatican and return on Thursday morning to continue voting. They will remain isolated during their deliberations, without phone or internet access and under oaths of total secrecy, until a two-thirds majority agrees on a candidate.The first conclave in more than a decade, a little more than two weeks after Pope Francis’ death set in motion the process of choosing his successor, comes during an uncertain time for the church, which is facing difficult decisions about its future direction, strained finances and a reckoning over past sexual abuse scandals.After a morning Mass, the conclave began as the cardinals, all men and nearly all over age 50, filed in a solemn procession into the Sistine Chapel, where they took assigned seats at long wooden tables under the soaring frescoes of Renaissance masters.The papal election is one of the world’s oldest dramas, but this one is unlike any before it, with many cardinals appointed by Francis meeting one another for the first time. The new faces bring unfamiliar politics, priorities and concerns that some experts say could make the selection process more fragmented than usual. Francis also left the church deeply divided, with progressive factions pushing for more inclusion and change and conservatives seeking to roll things back, often under the guise of preserving unity.Here’s what to know:How it works: The cardinals will participate in four rounds of voting every day until a candidate achieves a two-thirds majority. The ballots are burned after two rounds of voting, and the smoke above the Sistine Chapel signals whether a decision has been made — black smoke for no decision, white if there is a pope. There is no indication of how long it will take, though the last two conclaves reached decisions within two days.Possible successors: Predicting the outcome of a papal election is always challenging, but oddsmakers say that two top contenders are Cardinal Pietro Parolin of Italy, who was Francis’ second-in-command, and Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of the Philippines, a country where the church is growing rapidly.Referendum on Francis: The election in many ways will turn on whether the cardinals want a pope who will follow Francis’ path of openness and inclusion or forge a different one. During his 12-year pontificate, Francis made global headlines for landmark declarations that encouraged liberals, including allowing the blessing of people in same-sex unions and raising his voice for migrants.Test your knowledge: How well do you know the process of selecting a pope?

All 133 voting cardinals must write the name of the man he sees as pope on a rectangular piece of paper under the phrase “Eligo in Summum Pontificem,” or “I elect as the supreme pontiff.” Cardinals individually walk their ballots to the chapel’s altar, where they say an oath in Latin, and leave the ballot on a plate.Votes are counted before being read aloud and pierced and tied together with a red string (the “Conclave” film depicted this practice). After ballots are counted, they are burned.Smoke emerges from the Sistine Chapel up to twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Black smoke tells the world that the cardinals haven’t reached a decision; white smoke announces that a new pope has been chosen.Both of the past two popes — Benedict XVI in 2005 and Francis in 2013 — were elected in two days. For the past two centuries, each pope was selected within four days or fewer.The cardinal electors will take Sunday off for prayer if a pope has not been selected by Saturday afternoon.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTPaper ballots and sacred oaths: the objects guiding the conclave.The conclave to elect the next pope is now underway at the Vatican. The cardinals — the prelates who are just below the pope in the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy — will vote by secret ballot for a successor to Pope Francis until one candidate earns a two-thirds majority.While we may not know what’s being said during the conclave — it is off limits to outsiders — we do have a pretty good idea what it will look like. During the gathering, the cardinals will follow specific instructions and use several distinctive objects to facilitate the process, many steeped in tradition.Here’s a look at some of those objects, and the meaning behind them.Voting InstrumentsWhen the cardinals vote in the Sistine Chapel, they will be sitting in rows of simple wooden tables. At one end of the chapel, a large table is set up for those who run the voting, according to the Universi Dominici Gregis, or U.D.G., one of the documents used to govern the papal transition.The room also contains voting instruments, including an urn to receive the ballots, a set of wooden balls, and a needle and twine. The urn is used to collect the ballots, rectangular pieces of paper printed with the Latin phrase “Eligo in Summum Pontificem” (“I elect as Supreme Pontiff”).The ballots contain a space where each cardinal writes in the name of his chosen candidate. The ballots are placed in the urn and are removed for counting after all the cardinals have voted.The wooden balls are used to keep track of the ballots. The balls have numbers written on them that correspond to the number of cardinals voting in the conclave. As the ballots are being counted, an attendant removes one of the wooden balls for each ballot, to ensure that the number matches the number of cardinals, according to The Catholic Advocate, formerly a newspaper of the Archdiocese of Newark, N.J. If the numbers don’t match, the ballots must be burned without being read and another vote is conducted immediately, according to the U.D.G.As the ballots are being read, they are pierced with the needle through the word “Eligo” and strung onto the thread, “so that the ballots can be more securely preserved,” according to the U.D.G.ImageMembers of the clergy and conclave staff taking the oath of secrecy in the Pauline Chapel earlier this week.Credit...The VaticanThe Oath of SecrecyThe conclave is a secretive institution, and many steps are taken to prevent leaks, including restricting the cardinals’ use of phones, the internet and newspapers.The members of the College of Cardinals, the body that will elect the pope, must also swear and sign an oath of secrecy, according to the U.D.G. The oath reads, in part: “I will observe absolute and perpetual secrecy with all who are not part of the College of Cardinal electors concerning all matters directly or indirectly related to the ballots cast and their scrutiny for the election of the Supreme Pontiff.”The cardinals also must promise not to record anything in Vatican City during the time of the election. The punishment for breaking the oath is “automatic” excommunication, according to the oath.ImageA temporary stove in the Sistine Chapel in a photo provided by the Vatican.Credit...The VaticanThe StoveThe weekend before the conclave began, Vatican workers installed a simple stove in which ballots would be burned in the Sistine Chapel. Fire crews also installed a chimney on the roof of the chapel, where the smoke will leave the building.After each round of voting, the ballots are mixed with chemicals that, when burned, emit either black or white smoke. Black smoke means that the cardinals have not yet reached the requisite majority; white smoke means that a new pope has been elected and voting is over.The SealAt the beginning of the conclave, the Apostolic Palace, which contains the Sistine Chapel, is closed to the public. On Wednesday, members of the Pontifical Swiss Guard placed beaded ropes with the guard’s seal at the entrances to the palace to ensure privacy and maintain secrecy for the cardinals.The Vatican City government also planned to deactivate cellphone service within its territory for the duration of the conclave, starting on Wednesday afternoon.The Papal VestmentsAfter a pope is elected, he is taken to the “Room of Tears,” a small room next to the Sistine Chapel, where he will put on the white papal cassock for the first time. Garments in three sizes are prepared and kept in the room, since no one knows who — or what size — the next pope will be.The room is known as the “Room of Tears” because there are accounts of previous popes becoming overwhelmed with emotion in the room, and being moved to tears, after their election. After the pope puts on the vestments, he is introduced to the public for the first time.The faithful and the curious gather in St. Peter’s Square.ImageThe crowd in St. Peter’s Square reacts to the black smoke emanating from a Vatican chimney, indicating no decision has been made on a new pope. Credit...Eloisa Lopez/ReutersAfter the men who will select the next pope were locked inside the Sistine Chapel without cellphones on Wednesday, the only thing left to do was wait for them to send a signal to the outside world. By smoke.The highly secret voting began inside what is possibly one of the world’s most secure vaults in the early evening, with the 133 cardinals tasked with deciding who will succeed Pope Francis writing candidates’ names on voting cards by hand, trying to disguise their handwriting.Outside in St. Peter’s Square, thousands of the faithful, the curious and the vacationing gathered to await the news of whether the cardinals had managed to elect a papal successor. Word came at 9 p.m., in the form of black smoke billowing from a chimney installed last week on the roof of the chapel.If the smoke had been white, it would have meant that the cardinals had chosen the first new pope in a dozen years in just one round of voting, a feat not seen for centuries.But the black smoke, created when the cardinals’ ballots are incinerated in a cast-iron stove, means they’ll have to try again.“We are cold, we’re hungry, we’re thirsty but yet we can’t move,” said the Rev. Peter Mangum, 61, a priest at the Church of Jesus the Good Shepherd in Monroe, La. He and three other priests had been in the square for about seven hours, and it was Father Mangum’s fourth time waiting for news of a new pope.He had stood in the same spot for the elections of John Paul II, Benedict XVI and Francis, and he wasn’t going to budge until he knew Wednesday’s news. “We had to make sure the smoke was black,” he said.ImageThe black smoke flowing out from the Sistine Chapel on Wednesday night. Credit...Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesIt took two days to elect Pope Francis in 2013 and Benedict XVI in 2005. No conclave in the 20th or 21st centuries has lasted more than five days.In an era when news travels instantly around the world, the patience-requiring wait for the smoke in St. Peter’s Square is a ritual that dates back to the 19th century.For some, the anxiety was intense. “I think there’s more nervousness among the people outside than among the cardinals themselves,” said Tania Radesca, who arrived at the square at 1 p.m.Ms. Radesca, who is from Venezuela, had volunteered to help during the Jubilee, a year of pilgrimage that happens every 25 years, and she arrived in Rome just over a month ago. She was in St. Peter’s Square on Easter Sunday and caught a final glimpse of Pope Francis in his popemobile.He died a day later.Those who arrived early to score spots at the barricades closest to the front of St. Peter’s Basilica draped flags from their home countries along the barriers and befriended each other as they settled in. Others camped out on yoga mats or picnic blankets.ImageNuns praying at St. Peter’s Square as the conclave to elect the next pope gets underway, at the Vatican on Wednesday.Credit...Jeff Pachoud/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesMany had traveled a long way, specifically for the conclave. Rodrigo Pinto, 43, a retired karate instructor, flew 23 hours from Guatemala, landing on Tuesday afternoon and heading straight to St. Peter’s Square on Wednesday so he could wait for the first sign of smoke.Mr. Pinto, who was wearing a rosary, said, “I want to be a part of something I have always seen on TV, in documentaries, on the internet.” After standing in the rain in the morning and under the hot sun in the afternoon, he said, “Three hours ago, it was like hell. Sorry, St. Peter.”In a post office inside the square, Jennifer Raulli, 54, wrote postcards to her college-age children in the United States. She was in Rome on vacation with one of her daughters, who just graduated from Texas Christian University, and had gotten tickets to see Pope Francis say Mass on Wednesday. Instead, they arrived at the square to wait for the smoke that might herald the man who replaces him.“It is going to be a long couple of hours, but I would not miss it,” said Ms. Raulli, who had traveled from Pasadena, Calif. Ms. Raulli, who was raised Presbyterian and converted to Catholicism when she was 37, said she would prefer a “more conservative” pope because she would like the church to be “less politicized” and close to her vision of biblical teachings. The day of waiting began at 10 a.m. when Giovanni Battista Re, the spry, 91-year-old dean of the College of Cardinals, presided over a Mass inside St. Peter’s Basilica and implored the voting cardinals to choose “a pope who knows how best to awaken the consciences of all, and the moral and spiritual energies in today’s society.”As the cardinals gave each other the sign of peace during the service, Cardinal Re hugged Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican secretary of state under Francis and considered a leading candidate to succeed him. A microphone caught Cardinal Re wishing Cardinal Parolin best wishes.Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, another potential candidate who appeared with a fresh haircut, warmly shook his peers’ hands. Cardinal Jean-Marc Aveline, the archbishop of Marseille and also considered a papal contender, stopped for a prayer in front of the reliquary containing the remains of Pope John XXIII — a hero to many liberal Catholics for his efforts to modernize the church.ImageItalian cardinal Matteo Maria Zuppi, right, attends a Mass before the start of the conclave, at St. Peter’s Basilica in The Vatican.Credit...Dimitar Dilkoff/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesAfter lunch at the Casa Santa Marta, the lodging house inside the Vatican where the electors will stay throughout the conclave, the cardinals walked to the Sistine Chapel. As they proceeded into the chapel, they chanted the Litany of the Saints, while a choir hauntingly invoked the names of the saints. The cardinals replied with “Ora pro nobis,” or “Pray for us.” Outside in the square, many watching on the large video screens flanking the basilica swayed and echoed the cardinals’ chant.Inside the Sistine Chapel, name tags for the cardinals had been placed on the long tables where they would vote. Francis named many more cardinals than his two predecessors, some from countries far from the Vatican, and many of the papal electors — and potential popes — do not know one another.Around 5:45 p.m., Archbishop Diego Giovanni Ravelli, the master of pontifical liturgical celebrations, announced “extra omnes,” a Latin phrase that means “everybody out.” The giant wooden doors were closed, leaving the 133 cardinal electors — those under the age of 80 who can vote in the secret ballot — locked inside.ImageThe crowd in St. Peter’s Square watching a giant video screen displaying images of Diego Giovanni Ravelli, the master of pontifical liturgical celebrations, closing the doors of the Sistine Chapel.Credit...Andreas Solaro/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe cardinals will not be allowed to leave the Vatican until a two-thirds majority agrees on the next pope. Phones, internet, television and any contact from outside the Vatican walls are prohibited, a custom enforced to discourage the process from dragging on.Some veteran electors believed there would be prolonged voting. “Bring a book,” Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan of New York said he advised other cardinals, in an interview on Tuesday. The conclave began 16 days after Francis’ death on April 21. The significance of the moment was not lost even on those who had little knowledge of Catholicism.Yuichiro Yamakoshi, 41, a Japanese tourist traveling with his wife, said that after touring the Vatican museums and walking through the doors of the four main basilicas that are usually open only during the Jubilee, he started to understand the power and influence of the faith. Although the couple had come to St. Peter’s Square on Tuesday with a guide, they returned on Wednesday morning for a commemorative photo marking the conclave.As the black smoke dissipated into the sky, all there was to do was wait for another day.Of all the people coincidentally in Rome for the start of the papal conclave on Wednesday, the pilgrims from St. Cecilia Catholic Church in Houston may have had among the most poignant stories. The 47 faithful who had traveled with their priest — also coincidentally named Francis — to Rome this week had scheduled a meeting with Pope Francis on Wednesday. Instead, they were in St. Peter’s Square during the final Mass before the conclave beginning later in the day.One of the group, George Smith, 69, said, “It is a blessing for us.”As a river of people streamed out of the square, a group of Romans who had been convinced the smoke would be white shook hands and hugged. “See you tomorrow!” they said.ImageThe densely packed crowd in St. Peter’s Square on Wednesday night.Credit...Andrej Isakovic/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesReporting was contributed by Emma Bubola, Elisabetta Povoledo, Jason Horowitz, Elizabeth Dias, Matthew Mpoke Bigg, Bernhard Warner and Josephine de La Bruyère.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSurvivors call on the next pope to end sexual abuse by clergy.ImageThe Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests is one of several survivors groups to have arrived in Rome since Pope Francis died.Credit...Andrew Medichini/Associated PressAs cardinals prepared to enter the Sistine Chapel on Wednesday afternoon to elect a pope, groups representing survivors of sexual abuse by priests made last-minute appeals for the next pontiff to definitively resolve the crisis, which has shadowed the Roman Catholic Church for decades.The best way forward, the groups said, was to impose a zero-tolerance policy on transgressors and those who covered up for them, and for church leaders to own up to their own mishandling of abuse cases.“We want to work with the next pope to put an end to clerical abuse,” Peter Isely, a member of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, known as SNAP, said Wednesday at a news conference.In March, the group launched a website tracking each cardinal’s record in dealing with credible allegations against priests under his watch. Few in the upper echelons of the church’s hierarchy are without blame, the group claimed.On Friday, Matteo Bruni, the Vatican spokesman, said the cardinals had discussed sexual abuse in the run-up to the conclave and considered it a “wound to be kept open” so awareness of the problem remained alive and solutions could be identified.SNAP also presented a road map for the pope’s first 100 days, describing steps its members think he should take to resolve the crisis.SNAP is only one of several survivors groups to have arrived in Rome since Pope Francis died on April 21, hoping their message will resonate with the cardinals.One international group, Ending Clergy Abuse, or ECA, echoed Martin Luther’s radical 1517 call for church reform on Tuesday evening when it brought a manifesto — titled the 95 Theses of Survivors — to the front door of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Vatican office that handles most abuse cases. They did not nail it to the door, but tried to slip it between the doors.“I rang the doorbell but they didn’t answer,” said Gemma Hickey, the president of ECA, who is a survivor of abuse. It was not until they started reading the document out loud that the door opened and an official took it. “He didn’t say anything, but it was received, so I was happy with that, even if it was just symbolic.”Francesco Zanardi, the founder of Rete L’Abuso, Italy’s largest survivors’ group, said at a news conference on Tuesday that the church laws promoted by Pope Francis to guide bishops in handling abuse were often thwarted in Italy because national laws do not force bishops to report cases of abuse to law enforcement officials.Speaking out against clerical abuse is not always without consequence. Ann Hagan Webb and Anne Barrett Doyle, of BishopAccountability.org, an archive and advocacy group, said the police stopped them when they were walking near the Vatican office that handles abuse cases holding photos of two cardinals whose records on punishing abusers have drawn scrutiny.“They told us we couldn’t carry signs,” Ms. Barrett Doyle said. The police officers took photos of their documents and called other police officers before letting them go after about 45 minutes. “At least they didn’t arrest us,” she said.Under Pope Francis, the Vatican took decidedly stronger steps than it had in the past to counter sexual abuse.Francis issued the church’s most comprehensive law yet to hold clerics accountable if they sexually abused children or vulnerable adults, or if they covered up abuse. And he apologized to survivors on many occasions, acknowledging their pain. But critics have said that the measures were not enough and often were not applied because of resistance within the church.Come for the conclave, not for the food.ImagePope Francis having lunch at the Vatican in 2018. His emphasis on simple living and humility extended to the food he ate.Credit...Vincenzo Pinto/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe cardinals gathering for the conclave hope to pick the very best among them to be the leader of the Roman Catholic Church. Their culinary expectations are not so high.“Food you could eat at a train station” was how Cardinal Mauro Piacenza, a conclave veteran from the Italian city of Genoa, famous for its pesto, described the fare at the Casa Santa Marta, a guesthouse in the Vatican where the cardinals will be staying during the conclave. By train station food, he said he meant pastas with “watery sauce,” simple cutlets and salads: “Not exciting.”The ambience at Santa Marta isn’t much of a draw, either. Its cafeteria has pale green columns, utilitarian furniture and fan art in the hallway depicting Francis as a Jedi knight in “Star Wars.” But priests would angle for a reservation there because Santa Marta was the home of Pope Francis. Until he began ailing and taking his meals in his room, the pope often ate in the cafeteria at a table between the window and the refrigerator.Among the residents of the guesthouse, Francis, with his emphasis on simple living and humility, bore some blame for the decline in the food. Some lamented bland vegetables, less-than-rich pastas and leftovers from gifts to the pope — a box of dates from the Middle East, for example.Across the ideological spectrum, a consensus emerged.“You don’t eat very well,” said Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi of Italy, a supporter of Pope Francis.“It’s not so good,” said Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller of Germany, who was fired by Francis.The food at the conclave isn’t supposed to be good.The tradition of locking in the cardinals began in the 13th century, after residents of Viterbo, a town north of Rome where the election was being held, grew so frustrated with the process, which was taking years, that they ripped the roof off the building where the cardinals were meeting and reduced the menu to bread and water. The pope who came out of that election, Gregory X, decreed in 1274 that after three days of conclave, cardinals would get only one meal a day. The more days they took, the less food they got.But election menus improved. Centuries later, conclave food deliveries were inspected for secret messages — easily stuffable pies and chickens were verboten — and passed to the cardinals through a revolving door.When a 16th-century cardinal died during a conclave, some others claimed the food was poisoned. In the conclave that lasted from November 1549 to February 1550, the famed Vatican cook Bartolomeo Scappi noted that cardinals took turns acting as poison testers. Once it was clear the food was safe, they drank from carafes of wine and ate from hampers full of food.Scappi doesn’t say exactly what he fed them, but Crystal King, the author of a novel about the chef, wrote that her research led her to conclude they ate “ravioli and rabbit pappardelle” and “cheesy breads, veal croquettes, roasted bear, grilled beef ribs, open-faced mushroom crostatas, pheasant in red-currant sauce and maybe even caviar omelets.”Times have changed, and though Santa Marta is not exactly serving bread and water, the cardinals preparing to vote for the next pope know not to bring their appetites.“We will eat whatever they give us,” Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo Besungu of Congo said on Sunday. When told by a reporter about a subpar dining experience at the Santa Marta mess hall, he joked, “And you’re not dead.” He said that one had to have “trust in the Holy Spirit.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTFather Peter Mangum, of Monroe, La, waited for three hours in the same spot he had stood when the cardinals selected John Paul II, Benedict XVI and Francis. “We had to make sure the smoke was black,” he said before joining the river of people leaving St. Peter’s Square. “We’ll be back tomorrow morning,” he added. “Same spot.” People are filing out of the square, tired but in good spirits. “That spirit of just being together for three hours was quite beautiful,” said Father Francis Wambua, a priest from Machakos, Kenya, who is studying in Rome. He said he’ll be back tomorrow. José and Marisol Rodríguez, who traveled from Florida to experience the conclave, were mulling how late to stay in St. Peter’s Square when the black smoke came out of the chimney. They were happy to get a break for the night, especially since they had been present during the cardinals’ Mass in the morning. They plan to return Thursday and hope to see Cardinal Pizzaballa elected pope.The black smoke from the Vatican chimney confirms that the 133 cardinals did not reach a two-thirds majority needed to elect a pope on their first vote, and that they will have to meet and vote again in the morning.

It will release a plume of white smoke if a pope has been chosen, and black smoke if no candidate has won the required two-thirds majority of votes.It’s a tradition that scholars date to the 19th century, when conclaves were held at the Quirinale Palace, the papal palace across town that is now home to the Italian president.In “Behind Locked Doors,” a 2003 history of papal elections, Frederic J. Baumgartner wrote that the first evidence he found of smoke being used as a signal in a papal election was from 1823. The cardinals’ ballots were burned in previous conclaves, he wrote, but there was no record that the smoke was intended to inform the outside world of a new pope.The smoke comes from the burning of the ballots, as well as any notes that the cardinals have taken, which are placed in a cast-iron stove after each round of voting. (One round is held the first day, and four each day from then on, with two in the morning and two in the afternoon.) The ballots are burned after two rounds of voting, unless a pope is chosen.Until this century, wet straw was added to the stove to create the smoke’s white color. But it wasn’t always reliable.As The New York Times reported, during the 1958 conclave, white smoke seemed to appear twice during the second day of voting. That created confusion because, in fact, a pope had not yet been selected.A Times reporter described the frenzy outside St. Peter’s: “Dozens of newspapermen in the square made a dash for the nearest telephone,” and guests at a wedding inside the basilica dashed outside, “leaving the bride and bridegroom alone in front of a priest at the altar.”But it was a false alarm. The confusion in that conclave, which elected Pope John XXIII, led to conspiracy theories that another cardinal had been the real winner.In 1978, cartridges were first used to enhance the black or the white color of the smoke during the conclave that elected John Paul I. When he died suddenly 33 days after he was elected, the cartridges were used again in the election that year of his successor, John Paul II.ImageWhite smoke announcing that a new pope had been elected in 2013.Credit...Gregorio Borgia/Associated PressThat method was also imperfect science. In the case of John Paul I, an amusing video from the time shows befuddled reporters panicking as white smoke from the chimney turns black. “You can’t understand anything,” one frazzled reporter screams into a telephone. The Vatican later announced that a pope had been elected.By 2005, when John Paul II died, a more reliable system was devised that remains in use today. An electronic control unit resembling a stove is now placed alongside the cast-iron stove — they share a chimney flue — to burn cartridges that color the smoke from the ballots.Massimiliano De Sanctis, a fireworks expert, customized one of his fireworks machines for the Vatican, and it was used for the 2005 conclave that elected Benedict XVI and the 2013 conclave that elected Francis.“We didn’t invent anything new,” he said in an interview. “It’s the system used for fireworks.”The black or white smoke cartridges are placed in the unit, and when the ballots are burned in the cast-iron stove, a cardinal presses a button to set off the cartridges in the unit, coloring the smoke. For each vote, six cartridges are used, and the smoke lasts about seven minutes, Mr. De Sanctis said.After the confusion of the past, the Vatican doesn’t take chances: Once white smoke comes out of the chimney, bells will begin pealing from St. Peter’s Basilica, calling other churches in Rome to ring their bells as well.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTA sea gull took center stage at the last conclave.ImageA sea gull on the chimney atop the Sistine Chapel.Credit...Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesA solitary chimney above the Sistine Chapel will soon be the most watched object in the world.After each round of voting during the conclave to choose a new pope, the ballots are burned, and a glimpse at the chimney atop the Vatican signals the results. White smoke signifies that a new pope has been elected. Black smoke means more voting is needed. A sea gull sitting on the chimney means … wait, what now?During the last conclave in 2013, as millions focused their gaze on the roof of the Sistine Chapel, a sea gull landed on the chimney’s metal cover at an opportune moment.Was it a symbol? A blessing? A sign? Would the white bird signify white smoke?“That seagull on the Sistine Chapel roof by the conclave is great product placement for the Holy Spirit,” James Martin, a Jesuit priest, posted on Twitter at the time.The sea gull quickly became the most famous bird in the world. A social media account aptly named the Sistine Seagull was created almost immediately.“I can see them voting from up here, btw,” the account posted on Twitter, using an abbreviation for “by the way.” “Anybody has any questions, just ask.”The sea gull remained on the chimney for about 40 minutes.About an hour after the bird flew away, white smoke emerged from the chimney. Pope Francis had been chosen.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe Sistine Chapel becomes the world’s most beautiful polling place.ImageInside the Sistine Chapel.Credit...Andreas Solaro/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesCardinals are voting inside the Sistine Chapel beneath frescoes painted by Renaissance masters, a vaulted ceiling decorated by Michelangelo that is a landmark of Western art and his powerful “Last Judgment” on the eastern wall.It may be the world’s most beautiful polling place. Already internationally renowned, it is now “at the center of the attention of the world,” Barbara Jatta, the director of the Vatican Museums, told reporters on Tuesday.The Sistine Chapel is named after Sixtus IV, who became pope in 1471 and commissioned its construction as the primary chapel of the papal court. It has been posited, though there are skeptics, that the chapel’s dimensions — 131 feet by 42 feet, with ceilings 65 feet high — were meant to recall the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem as described in the Old Testament, Ms. Jatta said.ImageDetail of the ceiling.Credit...Fotopress/Getty ImagesBetween 1481 and 1483, Sixtus hired some of the greatest artists of the time — Perugino, Botticelli, Signorelli and Ghirlandaio — to fresco the walls of the chapel, which Ms. Jatta said is “symbolic of our faith, our art and our history.” The frescos depict scenes from the lives of Jesus Christ and Moses.When Julius II, the nephew of Pope Sixtus IV, became pope in 1503, he began an ambitious building program that included revamping St. Peter’s Basilica and completing the Sistine Chapel.In 1508, he brought in Michelangelo to paint the Sistine’s vault, replacing a previous fresco depicting a starry sky. Working alone on a platform and craning his neck while standing, as a sketched self-portrait shows, Michelangelo painted nine scenes from the Old Testament’s Book of Genesis, and nude figures (known as ignudi), prophets and sybils. It took him four years.Michelangelo later received a commission from Pope Clement VII to paint the wall behind the altar with a rendering of the Last Judgment. In his biography of Michelangelo, Giorgio Vasari wrote that Clement VII had wanted him to paint the work “so that he could demonstrate in this scene all that the art of design was capable of achieving.”Image“The Last Judgment” by Michelangelo.Credit...Fine Art Images/Heritage Images, via Getty ImagesMichelangelo hadn’t been thrilled by the gig. He considered himself a sculptor first and foremost, “but the pope called him and he was a faithful person,” said Ralf van Bühren, who teaches art history at the Santa Croce Pontifical University in Rome. In “The Last Judgment,” Michelangelo depicted a self-portrait in the skin of flayed St. Bartholomew, to show “he suffered so much, he didn’t like to paint,” he said.Not everyone was enthusiastic about “The Last Judgment,” with some clerics complaining that too many figures were nude. But Paul III, who became pope in 1534, was a fan. It is said that he fell on his knees, his eyes filling with tears, when the fresco was unveiled in 1541.Some believe the art will serve as inspiration to the cardinal electors as they gather beneath the frescoes.“The contemplation of these images evokes the spiritual responsibility of their vote,” Ms. Jatta said.ImageThe Sistine Chapel has been temporarily closed to tourists during the process of picking a new pope.Credit...Dimitar Dilkoff/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesFor the conclave, carpenters built a raised, beige-carpeted platform about two feet above the original floor so that it will be level with the second step leading to the altar. Running the length of the chapel are long tables where the cardinals will sit on cherry wood chairs marked with their names.The Sistine Chapel has been temporarily closed for days, disappointing tourists who may have planned to visit before Pope Francis’ death on April 21 set the succession process in motion.Last year, about 7 million visitors trooped through the Sistine Chapel, Ms. Jatta said. The chapel is “hyper monitored” with sensors, she said, and equipped with special lighting and an energy efficient air-conditioning system to minimize wear and tear on the space.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHow does the voting work?ImageCardinals gathered for a Mass before the start of the conclave on Wednesday.Credit...Dimitar Dilkoff/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesCasting ballots for pope is a carefully laid out ritual.According to established rules, lots are drawn to select nine cardinals who will have a role in the election. They are divided into three groups:Scrutineers: Three cardinals who oversee the entire process.Infirmarii: Three cardinals who collect the votes of any electors who are sick (though none was believed to be ill as of Wednesday).Revisers: Three cardinals who double-check the ballots at the end of each round of voting.The cardinals, sitting at long tables inside the Sistine Chapel, each receive rectangular pieces of paper printed with the Latin phrase “Eligo in Summum Pontificem,” or, “I elect as the supreme pontiff.” Beneath that, they write the name of their choice for pope.The 1996 conclave rules specify that the vote must be secret and the candidate’s name legible, “taking care not to write other names as well, since this would make the ballot null.” One by one, the cardinals walk with their ballot toward the chapel’s altar. Facing the eastern wall, which is decorated with Michelangelo’s “The Last Judgment,” each cardinal utters an oath, in Latin: “I call as my witness Christ the Lord who will be my judge, that my vote is given to the one who before God I think should be elected.”Then the cardinal places the ballot on a plate and slides it into an urn, traditionally a large chalice.After all the cardinals have voted, one of the scrutineers mixes the ballots by shaking the chalice. Then the votes are counted individually and placed into a second container. The number of ballots and voters have to match; otherwise, the vote is void.The ballots are then opened and read by all three scrutineers. The third one announces the name out loud, and records it.Once the votes have been tallied, a scrutineer pierces each ballot with a needle and threads them together with a red string. After the revisers check the count, the ballots are burned.Except for the first day, when there is only one vote, two votes take place every morning and two every afternoon, until two-thirds of the cardinals agree on the choice.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Papal Conclave: First Vote Yields No Pope\\nENTITIES: Pope Francis, Cardinals, Sistine Chapel, Vatican\\nEVENT: Cardinals failed to elect a new pope in the first conclave vote, signaling with black smoke; voting resumes Thursday.\\nCONTEXT: First vote inconclusive, cardinals continue papal selection process.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 54263, 'sourceId': 12341, 'url': 'https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/may/7/congress-digs-chinas-alleged-theft-americas-ai-secrets/', 'title': \"Congress digs into China's alleged theft of America's AI secrets\", 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T20:31:26.000Z', 'content': 'House lawmakers are worried that Chinese thieves are stealing America’s artificial intelligence secrets, boosting confidential info from the leading labs building top technology.\\nRep.

When we reclaim our food, we reclaim our power.”The collective, founded four years ago to cultivate a 1,200-sq-metre plot of waste ground in Lewisham, is open to all but brings together members of the African diaspora “to heal and also to learn about our history through the soil”.A Coco Collective gardening session led by Goode (centre). Photograph: Andy Hall/The GuardianMany of those who volunteer in the garden “are only maybe one or two generations from people that would have worked the land”, says Goode, “and our ancestors before that knew nothing other than being on the land”. In its own way, she says, the collective is “radical … because we honour Mother Earth and [recognise that] we are intrinsically connected”.It is a bold and inspiring vision – but not necessarily one you would expect to find in a library. And yet the work of the collective is central to a new exhibition at the British Library in London, which explores and celebrates the social and frequently political history of cultivation, plant acquisition and land use throughout British history.Radicalism is not a term one would always associate with British gardens, but who controls land, who works it and the crops they grow there have always been contested questions, as the exhibition illustrates. Before gardening was a hobby, it was a lifeline – or as a member of Coco Collective puts it in one of the short films displayed as part of the exhibition: “We’ve been growing longer than we’ve been writing books.”Part of the exhibition at the British Library. Photograph: The British Library“Gardening is much more than the nation’s favourite pastime, and we think that it has quite a fascinating and surprising history,” said Maddy Smith, the library’s curator of printed heritage collections 1601-1900 and lead curator of the exhibition.The library had previously held exhibitions looking at “the grander aspects of gardens”, she said, but “we felt that gardening is something that is enjoyed by a lot of different people, and we wanted to reflect that in the objects and the stories that we told”.Among the items on display from the library’s collection are an 11th-century illuminated guide to herbal remedies – the only such work to survive from Anglo-Saxon England – and Profitable Instructions of Kitchin Gardens, a book written by the aptly named Richard Gardiner of Shrewsbury, to teach his community how to grow vegetables after a series of disastrous harvests in the 1590s.Common land, once shared by rural communities, had been subject to enclosures – transferring it into private ownership – since England’s population plummeted during the plague pandemic of 1348, but it often led to social unrest and revolt. A map from 1791 of the village of Bow Brickhill in Buckinghamshire shows how the land had been carved up between various gentlemen (and some women), with a number of chunks allocated to “the Rector”. A small outlying patch is “the Poor’s Allotment”.‘We honour Mother Earth and [recognise that] we are intrinsically connected’: a Coco Collective gardening session. Photograph: Andy Hall/The Guardian“People have had to fight for the right to garden over the centuries, and against efforts to privatise and enclose land,” said Smith, “and we wanted to chart that fight.” As well as documents from the time of the Diggers and Levellers, 17th-century movements demanding land reform, “we have [material about] gardeners in Levenshulme, near Manchester, planting cabbages as an act of protest.” The Levenshulme land grabbers, as they were nicknamed in 1906, claimed they were cultivating six acres of unfenced church land “for the benefit of the unemployed”.British gardens have never been purely functional or decorative spaces, as this exhibition illustrates. The early 19-century craze for orchids – beautifully illustrated in books from the time – decimated the ecosystems from which they were taken. The Royal Navy’s lust for New Zealand flax led it to kidnap two Māori chiefs in 1788, whom they ordered to teach them how to cultivate it (the men refused, not least because this, to them, was women’s work).Even a beautifully illustrated plan of Capability Brown’s lawns at Blenheim Palace dating to 1771 is presented in the context of the grass monoculture it helped inspire in the British landscape. It is displayed alongside an irreverent modern poster by the artist Sam Wallman that decries lawns as “a symbol of control, dominance and status”. “Hoes over mows,” it reads.\\nUnearthed: The Power of Gardening is at the British Library until 10 August', 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Exhibition charts radical history of gardening in Britain\\nENTITIES: Coco Collective, British Library, Valerie Goode, Maddy Smith\\nEVENT: The British Library is hosting an exhibition called 'Unearthed: The Power of Gardening' that explores the social and political history of gardening in Britain, including the Coco Collective's work to reclaim food production and power.\\nCONTEXT: Exhibition explores the political history of British gardening.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 49312, 'sourceId': 12484, 'url': 'https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/samsung-will-unveil-the-super-slim-galaxy-s25-edge-on-monday-heres-how-to-watch/#ftag=CAD590a51e', 'title': \"Samsung Will Unveil the Super-Slim Galaxy S25 Edge on Monday: Here's How to Watch\", 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T23:00:00.000Z', 'content': 'At long last, the super-thin Galaxy S25 Edge that Samsung teased earlier this year is slated to make its official debut.

It could also be equipped with a\\xa0Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip.Additional rumors suggest the Galaxy S25 Edge could have a 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a 2,130 x 1,440 resolution, 12 GB of RAM and 256GB or 512GB of storage. Again, we\\'ll have to see what the official specs are from Samsung come May 12.Why is Samsung making a thin Galaxy phone?So, why would someone want a thin phone anyway?\\xa0It appears many phone makers, from Samsung to Apple to Oppo, are eyeing slim phones as the next design iteration to lure in potential customers. Oppo released its super-thin Find N5 foldable earlier this year, which it calls the \"world\\'s thinnest book-style foldable,\" measuring just 8.93mm thick when closed and 4.21mm thick when opened. Apple is rumored to be developing an \"Air\" version of the iPhone 17, a thinner (and presumably lighter) version of its handset. At MWC 2025, phone-maker Tecno showed off its Spark Slim phone concept, a handset measuring 5.75mm thick (skinnier than a standard pencil) and weighing only 146 grams, according to the company.\\xa0But thin phones have a big hurdle to overcome: Less space often means a smaller battery, scaled-back camera hardware and less storage. And as it so happens, those are three of the biggest considerations when people buy a new phone, according to a CNET survey from August.\\xa0\"You can\\'t just be thin; you have to still have all the bells and whistles of a premium phone,\" Nabila Popal, senior director of data and analytics at IDC, told me at MWC in March. \"The question is, how are OEMs [phone makers] going to achieve that without compromising the other more important features like battery and camera?\"Popal also noted that the \"slim is in\" trend is largely an attempt by phone makers to differentiate their products. AI has also been a means for companies to make their offerings stand out, but that\\'s already become rather ubiquitous. An eye-catchingly thin phone could be one way to grab people\\'s attention -- and dollars.As Samsung sees it, it\\'s all about \"merging flagship-level performance with superior portability,\" it noted in its post, adding, \"As our reliance on these devices grows, so do our expectations for them to be portable and lightweight without sacrificing power and innovation.\"Starting Wednesday, eligible customers who reserve the Galaxy S25 Edge can get a $50 Samsung credit toward the device. \\xa0We\\'ll see what\\'s in store come May 12.', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Samsung unveils super-slim Galaxy S25 Edge\\nENTITIES: Samsung, Galaxy S25 Edge, Apple, Oppo, Tecno\\nEVENT: Samsung will unveil the super-slim Galaxy S25 Edge at a virtual Unpacked event on May 12, featuring a 200-megapixel wide lens and AI capabilities.\\nCONTEXT: Samsung aims to lure customers with a super-slim phone design.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 50802, 'sourceId': 12614, 'url': 'https://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/25145362.wantage-market-place-road-closure-ve-day-celebrations/?ref=rss', 'title': 'Wantage Market Place road closure for VE Day celebrations', 'publishDate': '2025-05-08T04:00:00.000Z', 'content': 'Wantage Market Place (Image: Google Street View)\\nThis article is brought to you by our exclusive subscriber partnership with our sister title USA Today,\\nand has been written by our American colleagues.\\nIt does not necessarily reflect the view of The Herald.\\nMarket Place in Wantage will be closed to all traffic for the majority of Sunday as the town marks the 80th anniversary of VE Day.\\nThe closure will be in place from 7.30am to 9.30pm on May 11.\\nAlfred Street, as well as Newbury Street from Market Place to its junction with Church Street, Wallingford Street from Market Place to its junction with Little Lane, Mill Street from Market Place to its junction with Limborough Close, Grove Street from Market Place to cul-de-sac, and Stirlings Road from its junction with Grove Street to the junction by the library, will also be closed.\\nBus services will be disrupted, with the Market Place stop suspended.

The communications minister is also expected to decide which social media platforms it will apply to in the near future.\\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email\\nThe Age Check Certification Scheme (ACCS), which is running the trial, did not publicise the progress of the trial during the course of the federal election campaign. However, this week the company released the minutes of a meeting held with stakeholders in March.In the meeting, the Age Verification Providers Association executive director, Iain Corby, told the meeting that Google was “considering” submitting a proposal to “allow users to store an age credential in their Google Wallet and share it with apps and websites when needed”.Separately, Google announced at the end of April that it would implement ID passes in Google Wallet in the UK – after already making it available in the US.Under this system, users can take an issued ID such as a passport or licence, hold the information in the wallet, and share their date of birth with a website or app without sharing any other personal information.In a website or app, it would offer a prompt similar to existing payment verification methods to allow users to share this information, and would use the existing authentication methods like passcode, fingerprint or facial recognition associated with phone-based payments.Google also announced in February it was testing a “machine learning-based age estimation model” to determine whether a user is under or over 18.Google was approached for comment.Apple announced similar technology in February, but the committee noted in its attempts to ask Apple about the technology, that the tech giant “has been unresponsive, despite multiple outreach attempts”.Dr Alexia Maddox, director of digital education at La Trobe University, said Google’s proposal could be a “fundamental misunderstanding” of the social media ban legislation.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotion“The bill aims to protect children under 16, but Google Wallet is primarily an adult-oriented service that most children don’t have access to,” she said. “This creates a paradoxical situation where the very users the legislation aims to identify and protect – children – would be unlikely to have the verification tool being proposed.”Maddox warned against “retrofitting an existing commercial product rather than developing a purpose-built solution for child protection”.“For age verification to be effective and compliant with the bill’s privacy protections, we need approaches that work for all age groups, preserve privacy, destroy data after verification, and don’t further concentrate data in the hands of major tech platforms.”Before the social media ban legislation passed in December, Meta and TikTok pushed the government to make Apple and Google, as the device makers, bear responsibility for age assurance, but the federal government decided the onus should rest on the app makers.As part of the trial, more than 1,000 students across five states will take part in testing of at least 25 different age verification or assurance methods, with priority placed on facial age estimation technology.The trial will test some ways children may try to get around the verification, the meeting heard.Following the re-election of the Albanese government, consultation will also continue on which platforms the ban should apply to. Guardian Australia revealed last month the chief executive of YouTube personally lobbied the communications minister, Michelle Rowland, less than 48 hours before she announced YouTube would be exempt from the ban.The news sparked fury from YouTube’s rivals, Meta and TikTok, over what was deemed to be a “sweetheart” deal for the platform.During the election campaign, the federal infrastructure department, which is overseeing the consultation, wrote to Meta stating “while the former minister for communications proposed to exclude YouTube, no legislative rules have been made giving effect to this”.', 'location': 'AUS', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Google age ID proposal for Australia ban\\nENTITIES: Google, Australia, Age Check Certification Scheme, Apple, Meta, TikTok\\nEVENT: Google is considering age ID in Google Wallet for Australia's social media ban for under 16s, but experts question its effectiveness.\\nCONTEXT: Age verification tech may not suit Australia's ban.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 50431, 'sourceId': 12606, 'url': 'https://theweek.com/business/wall-street/warren-buffett-retirement-legacy', 'title': \"What will be Warren Buffett's legacy?\", 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T17:50:45.000Z', 'content': 'Warren Buffett is retiring.

Oprah Winfrey was once a spokeswoman and board member.But the company has struggled to keep its customers as people turn to weight-loss medications, fitness apps and social media influencers.Under a bankruptcy plan filed in Delaware, WeightWatchers will be taken over by a group of investors, the filing said. Existing shareholders will retain a 9 percent stake once the process is completed in about 45 days, and the company will continue operating.The changes “will give us the flexibility to accelerate innovation, reinvest in our members, and lead with authority in a rapidly evolving weight management landscape,” Tara Comonte, the chief executive of WeightWatchers, said in a statement.WeightWatchers was founded in New York City by Jean Nidetch, an entrepreneur who had shed 72 pounds by adhering to a strict diet with the support of her friends. She charged dieters a fee to attend periodic meetings, where they were encouraged to keep track of what they ate and to motivate one another.The company evolved by adding an exercise regimen and a point system that quantified appropriate food portions. Now it offers weight-loss programs and fitness coaching on its mobile app and website.In 2022, the company paid a $1.5 million penalty as part of a settlement after the Federal Trade Commission said that its weight-loss app for children had illegally collected personal information from minors. Pediatricians criticized the app, warning that weight-loss programs for children could lead to eating disorders.The company has also faced headwinds in recent years from rising demand for Ozempic, Wegovy, Zepbound and other drugs that help people lose weight in part by suppressing appetite.WeightWatchers rebranded as WW International in 2018 as part of an effort to broaden its focus beyond weight loss. In 2023, it acquired Sequence, a subscription-based telehealth platform, and began offering weight-loss medications.The company’s latest earnings report on Tuesday showed that its revenue from its clinical business, including prescription drugs, had grown 57 percent year-on-year. But its first-quarter revenue had declined by 10 percent.The coronavirus pandemic resulted in a significant drop in people who attended in-person WeightWatchers meetings, prompting the company to reduce the number of meetings it offered.WeightWatchers has also lost one of its most prominent spokeswomen, Ms. Winfrey.She joined its board in 2015, and credited WeightWatchers with helping her lose 40 pounds. But last year, months after she announced that she was taking a weight-loss medication, the company said that she was leaving.Months later, WeightWatchers’ shares, which had soared to about $100 in 2018, became a penny stock. They closed at 79 cents on Tuesday.John Yoon is a Times reporter based in Seoul who covers breaking and trending news.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: WeightWatchers Files for Bankruptcy to Reduce Debt\\nENTITIES: WeightWatchers, Oprah Winfrey, Jean Nidetch, Federal Trade Commission, Tara Comonte\\nEVENT: WeightWatchers filed for bankruptcy to reduce debt and expand its telehealth business amidst competition from weight-loss drugs and programs; a group of investors will take over, with existing shareholders retaining a 9% stake.\\nCONTEXT: WeightWatchers faces challenges from weight-loss drugs and changing consumer preferences.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 53826, 'sourceId': 12799, 'url': 'https://www.smh.com.au/business/workplace/what-s-the-future-of-work-well-that-s-up-to-you-20250508-p5lxmf.html?ref=rss', 'title': 'What’s the future of work?

That’s one of those grand, esoteric questions that gets thrown at anyone who spends their time thinking about how the grounds we are working on are constantly shifting beneath our feet.And it’s changing a lot. There are societal adjustments like work from home and employment landscapes, technological changes like automation and AI, rising trends like four-day work weeks, increasing skills gaps in our workplaces and political winds like the right to disconnect and labour laws.There is no single answer as to what the future of work will hold that will be the same for every person.Credit: iStockI spend some of my time delivering talks and workshops to businesses of all sizes to help them deal with these shifts. It doesn’t matter whether I’m in Melbourne or Milton Keynes, I can almost guarantee you that during the audience Q&A after talking about how work is changing, someone will always put their hand up and ask a variation of the question: “So, what is the future of work then?”It’s a loaded question that I’ve spent a long time trying to get to the bottom of, and have now come to the conclusion that the future of work is simply three things: it’s personal, it’s messy, and it’s here right now.Let’s start with the first one. There is no single answer as to what the future of work will hold that will be the same for every person, as the future of my work is completely different to yours.Just as each of our winding career paths to get us where we are today is unique, so too are the 3.6 billion different ways that everyone’s jobs will evolve for each worker on Earth.How it will change is going to depend on your occupation, history, workplace, skills and industry. So please always keep that in mind when someone tells you exactly what’s going to happen to your particular job without any of the context surrounding it.The second answer is that the future of work will be messy. This is not the neat response most people want to hear, but every organisation and employee is currently trying to figure it out in real time.Take the upheaval over whether knowledge workers should WFH or return to the office five days a week. There’s hardly a boardroom or team meeting that hasn’t had to deal with the inherent complications in trying to make this new way of working actually work equally for everyone in the building.Both sides, employers and employees, need to understand that messiness is part of the design, not its flaw. We are all fumbling our way through attempting to figure out how the future of work applies to our everyday reality, and missteps are part of the process.LoadingThe final aspect is that the future of work, whether we’re ready or not, is already here. Many of the things we predicted would happen “one day” have arrived. Technology is performing complex tasks easier than before, and advances in science is opening up new fields every day.Job titles, responsibilities and skills requirements are changing faster than education can keep up, and we are transforming how we work in ways that previous generations could only dream of.However, at the centre of all of this futuristic talk, sits you and your job. The future of work might be personal, messy and already here, but it’s still up to us to learn how to adapt and experiment so that it still works for us.After all, the future isn’t something that just happens passively to us, it’s one that we still have the power to influence, one personal, messy decision at a time.Tim Duggan is the author of Work Backwards: The Revolutionary Method to Work Smarter and Live Better.

If demonstrated to be safe, geoengineering could temporarily cool the planet and give more time to tackle the root cause of the climate crisis: the burning of fossil fuels.The experiments will be small-scale and rigorously assessed before going ahead, Aria said.

Some previously planned outdoor experiments have been cancelled after strong opposition.However, given the failure of the world to stop emissions rising to date, and the recent run of record hot years, backers of solar geoengineering say researching the technology is vital in case an emergency brake is needed. The Aria programme, along with another £10m project, makes the UK one of the biggest funders of geoengineering research in the world.“Decarbonisation is the first and best chance of avoiding these tipping points,” said Prof Mark Symes, the programme director at Aria. “But the current trajectory puts us in danger of triggering some tipping points, regardless of what happens with net zero, so we do need to think about what we might do in that eventuality.“The point of the programme is to explore and research as transparently as possible whether any of the proposed cooling approaches could ever be used safely,” he said. “Life in the UK could become very difficult if any of these tipping points were triggered.”Ilan Gur, Aria’s CEO, said: “If science can show us that an elegantly designed spray of seawater can protect and preserve the incredible biodiversity of the Great Barrier Reef, isn’t that something we want to understand?”The announcement was criticised by Prof Raymond Pierrehumbert at the University of Oxford: “Solar geoengineering has enormous and troubling implications for global society. The UK funding sets a dangerous precedent for other governments to jump on the bandwagon [and] it is the height of folly to open the door to field experiments in the absence of any national or international governance.”Mary Church, at the Center for International Environmental Law, said: “Solar geoengineering is inherently unpredictable and risks breaking further an already broken climate system. Conducting small-scale experiments risks normalising highly controversial theories and accelerating technological development, creating a slippery slope toward full-scale deployment.”Most geoengineering proposals aim to block sunlight reaching and heating the Earth’s surface. However, solar radiation management (SRM) has the potential for serious unintended consequences, such as shifting rains vital to food production. Some private companies are already working on geoengineering; that makes building the scientific evidence base even more important, Gur said.solar geoengineering diagramThe Aria-funded experiments include sending a weather balloon into the stratosphere above the US or UK. Milligram samples of non-toxic mineral dust will be exposed to the high-altitude conditions and then recovered to assess how the particles’ properties change with time.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionAnother three experiments will test how seawater sprays or electrical charges delivered by drones can seed tiny water droplets, making clouds over the oceans reflect more sunlight. One will expand current work over the Great Barrier Reef, which is in crisis because of global heating, and may reach 100sq km in scale, while another will take place on the UK coast.One experiment will involve pumping water on to sea ice in Canada in winter.

The water will freeze and preserve the ice sheet for longer in summer. Bright white ice reflects far more sunlight than the dark ocean revealed when sea ice is lost to warming waters.There will be an environmental impact assessment made public before any outdoor experiments take place and local communities will have been consulted. There is also an independent oversight committee as part of the approval process, Aria said, chaired by the leading climate scientist Prof Piers Forster and including members from India and Ghana.The Aria programme will also assess space reflectors, which are sunshades placed into orbit, using modelling to determine their feasibility. “This is the most speculative of all the approaches we’re funding,” said Symes. Volcanic eruptions naturally inject particles into the atmosphere and another project will fly drones through the plumes to measure the particles’ effects.Seven modelling teams will investigate the impacts of geoengineering on climate and ecosystems, especially in developing countries, where about 85% of the world’s population lives. There will be a further five teams working on ethics and governance to explore the wider societal implications of geoengineering, such as how any future deployment should be agreed and managed.', 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: UK funds real-world geoengineering experiments globally\\nENTITIES: UK government, Advanced Research and Invention Agency (Aria), Mark Symes, Ilan Gur, Raymond Pierrehumbert, Mary Church, Piers Forster, US, Canada, India, Ghana\\nEVENT: The UK government is funding real-world geoengineering experiments globally, including testing sun-reflecting particles, brightening clouds, and thickening sea ice, to gather critical scientific data and potentially cool the planet temporarily.\\nCONTEXT: Geoengineering research is vital in case an emergency brake is needed to avoid catastrophic climate tipping points.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 46895, 'sourceId': 12410, 'url': 'https://www.medpagetoday.com/psychiatry/generalpsychiatry/115463', 'title': 'Meds Without Therapy Declining; Conversion Therapy Effects; Trial Diversity Needed', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T17:55:30.000Z', 'content': '1US surpasses 1,000 measles cases in 2025, second worst year since disease was declared eliminated | CNNopens in a new tab or windowopens in a new tab or window', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: US Measles Cases Surge, Second Worst Year\\nENTITIES: US, CNN\\nEVENT: The US has surpassed 1,000 measles cases in 2024, marking the second-worst year since the disease was declared eliminated.\\nCONTEXT: Measles cases are surging in the US after elimination.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 48972, 'sourceId': 12459, 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/08/woodside-energy-agm-investor-climate-concerns', 'title': 'Woodside staves off investor climate concerns at fiery AGM beset by protesters', 'publishDate': '2025-05-08T05:59:19.000Z', 'content': \"Woodside Energy has withstood a rebuke by shareholders of its climate plans by garnering sufficient support to retain its chosen board members and approve executive pay plans at a fiery annual general meeting on Thursday.A diverse group of investors, including fund managers and governance organisations, opposed the re-election of high-profile Woodside director Ann Pickard, a former Shell executive who chairs the committee responsible for overseeing climate risk at the Perth-headquartered oil and gas company.There was also a push by shareholders to vote down Woodside’s remuneration report.While there was a moderate protest vote recorded against both resolutions, Pickard was re-elected with a comfortable majority, and the pay plans were approved, according to preliminary voting results.\\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email\\nCritics believe Woodside’s strategy is overly reliant on offsets, not aligned with Paris climate agreements, and does not seriously consider emissions produced by those using its gas.The super fund, Hesta, said ahead of the meeting it had voted against various resolutions including the re-election of Pickard over concerns that Woodside had no formalised net zero target.“We believe the steps taken by Woodside so far fall short of what is needed to position it for the global transition to a low-carbon future and the company needs to do more to materially address the concerns voiced by investors,” a Hesta spokesperson said.Alex Hillman, lead analyst of the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, said Woodside was allocating most of its capital expenditure to “high-cost fossil fuel projects in an industry that is in structural decline”.“This persistent pattern of investor dissent and Woodside’s failure to adequately respond shows this is a company with a major governance problem,” Hillman said.Woodside is on track to become one of the world’s biggest gas producers after recently giving the go-ahead to a $US17bn ($26bn) development in Louisiana, and has unveiled an aggressive company-wide plan to double production within several years.Woodside was strident in its defence of its operations on Thursday at a meeting that was paused on multiple occasions to remove whistle-blowing protesters.A protester blows a whistle as the CEO of Woodside Energy, Meg O'Neill, speaks during the Woodside AGM in Perth on Thursday.

Cross for The New York TimesMay 7, 2025Speaker Mike Johnson has dropped one of the most aggressive options the G.O.P. was considering to cut Medicaid costs to help pay for President Trump’s domestic agenda, bowing to pressure from politically vulnerable Republicans and underscoring the deep party divisions imperiling the plan.Leaving his office on Tuesday night after meeting with a group of more moderate members, Mr. Johnson told reporters that House Republicans had ruled out lowering the amount the federal government pays states to care for working-age adults who became eligible for the program through the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion.Mr. Johnson also suggested he was leaning against another way of reducing spending on Medicaid, by changing the way the federal government pays states — currently by providing a percentage of beneficiaries’ medical bills — to a flat fee per person.“I think we’re ruling that out as well, but stay tuned,” the speaker said.The retreat was an acknowledgment that many House Republicans viewed the ideas — both of which would create large state budget shortfalls — as politically toxic. It also underscored how difficult it will be for Mr. Johnson’s conference to find Medicaid cuts that hit the spending targets Republicans set for themselves and also win enough votes to pass.Ultraconservative Republicans quickly vented their opposition, in a public reminder that Mr. Johnson’s efforts to stave off a revolt of mainstream lawmakers could cost him crucial support from his right flank. That could doom Mr. Trump’s vast tax and spending cut plan in the House, where the speaker can afford to lose fewer than a handful of votes.“Well - I haven’t ruled it out,” Representative Chip Roy, Republican of Texas, declared on social media after Mr. Johnson’s comments on Tuesday night about abandoning the idea of cutting back on federal payments for some Medicaid beneficiaries. “It’s necessary to stop robbing from the vulnerable to fund the able-bodied.”And as if to drive home the point of Mr. Johnson’s challenging balancing act, a group of 32 conservatives sent him a letter on Wednesday insisting that they would support the reconciliation bill only if it does not add to the deficit. That means that if Republicans fail to come up with enough spending cuts, they would also have to accept a smaller tax cut to compensate.“The deficit reduction target must be met with real, enforceable spending cuts — not budget gimmicks,” they wrote in the letter, led by Representative Lloyd K. Smucker of Pennsylvania, a member of the Ways and Means Committee.House Republicans are laboring to identify roughly $2 trillion in spending cuts to help offset both the 2017 tax cuts they want to extend and the new tax cuts they want to pass in their reconciliation bill. The biggest challenge so far has centered on the Medicaid program, which provides health insurance to 72 million poor and disabled Americans.The House budget plan calls for $880 billion in cuts from the committee that oversees the program, a target that would be difficult to achieve without substantial changes. If House Republicans cannot agree on policies that comply with the instructions, the entire package could be doomed.Abruptly reducing federal funding for the program by paying less in the 40 states and the District of Columbia that have expanded Medicaid under Obamacare would have saved an estimated $710 billion over a decade, according to new estimates released by the Congressional Budget Office on Wednesday.That would have cut funding to state governments, which would have been left with difficult choices. Nine states have passed laws that would cause them to automatically drop coverage for the expansion population if federal funding declines, and three others have provisions that would force an immediate legislative review.Other states would need to make up the money in some other way — by cutting benefits or payments to medical providers, raising taxes or cutting other state functions. As a result of those changes, the budget office estimated that the policy would cause 5.5 million Americans to lose their Medicaid coverage and 2.4 million Americans to become uninsured.The Obamacare expansion extended health benefits to poor, childless adults without disabilities, a population that many Republican lawmakers consider less worthy of resources than other populations Medicaid serves, such as poor children, pregnant women and Americans who live in nursing homes. But other Republicans see this population as a core constituency, as working-class voters have become a growing component of the party’s electoral coalition.Some conservatives like Mr. Roy have argued that uniting around cutting the Affordable Care Act, a program their party detests, should be the bare minimum for Republicans looking to raise revenue for Mr. Trump’s agenda.“I’ve got a bunch of my colleagues running around saying, ‘Well, we can’t touch Medicaid,’” Mr. Roy said in a speech on the House floor. “Why can’t we? Medicaid was expanded under Obamacare, which we all opposed, and the Medicaid expansion was a big reason why we opposed it.”But many of Mr. Roy’s colleagues, especially those in politically competitive seats, do not agree. The cuts would be particularly damaging in wealthier Democratic-led states, such as California and New York, where Republicans have been elected in districts where many constituents use Medicaid.“I will never support cuts to Medicaid, Medicare or Social Security that are not specifically aimed at reducing waste, fraud or abuse,” said Representative Jeff Van Drew, Republican of New Jersey.But without any such cuts, Republicans are left with a dwindling set of options that would allow them to meet their $880 billion target. Medicaid reforms with broad support across the caucus, such as requiring beneficiaries to prove they are employed in order to keep their benefits, would not reduce spending by nearly as much.Another option under consideration, limiting taxes on hospitals and other complex financing maneuvers that states use to increase federal spending on the program, would tend to disadvantage states led by Republicans. The budget office estimated it would reduce the deficit by around $668 billion and cause 3.9 million more people to become uninsured.Mr. Trump has also recently expressed a reluctance to make any major cuts to Medicaid, and has repeated several times that the program should not be “touched.” A White House official said Mr. Trump was pushing for stronger discounts on prescription drugs used in Medicaid, an alternative that would avoid some of the political pitfalls but may not save enough to comply with the budget language.Catie Edmondson covers Congress for The Times.Margot Sanger-Katz is a reporter covering health care policy and public health for the Upshot section of The Times.A version of this article appears in print on \\xa0, Section A, Page 17 of the New York edition with the headline: Pressured by Moderates, Johnson Rules Out an Aggressive Plan to Cut Medicaid.

Ministerial code requires ministers to ensure “that no conflict arises, or could reasonably be perceived to arise” from their public duties and private interests.The regulator, which is being established via a bill currently going through parliament, was recommended by former Conservative sports minister Tracey Crouch. It will supervise English men’s professional football clubs.That recommendation followed the collapse of Bury in 2019 and the failed attempt two years later by six English top-flight clubs to create a breakaway European Super League.Kogan said the regulator should be seen as an “asset” to the game and not a “cop”. It would have “quite a lot of teeth” despite being designed to be “light touch” with a “relatively lightweight bureaucracy”, he added.David Kogan speaking at the House of Commons culture, media and sport committee © House of Commons“I want the regulator to have a help desk and have a way whereby we’re not seen as being a cop in the world of football, we’re seen as being an asset to the world of football,” he told the House of Commons culture, media and sport committee.His remarks come against a backdrop of concerns, particularly at the Premier League, that the body could deter investment in one of Britain’s greatest cultural exports and undermine the division’s competitiveness.Kogan, who has negotiated media rights deals on behalf of the major football competition organisers in England, said that if clubs lacked the accounting practices to answer questions about their financing and liquidity, the body would supply it.“If you do not have an understanding of what we’re trying to do, we will send a team to you,” he added.Kogan said that he looked forward to speaking with football chiefs about resolving the differences between the Premier League and the English Football League, which runs the Championship, League One and League Two, over how money is shared by the top flight with the rest of the football pyramid.The regulator will have “backstop” powers that enable it to intervene in the negotiations, which have dragged on for years. But Kogan, a fan of Tottenham Hotspur, urged football bosses to “agree among themselves” and “not to invoke” the backstop.“The less you hear of the regulator, the better,” he said.', 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: UK regulator stresses independence amid Labour ties\\nENTITIES: David Kogan, Labour party, Conservative party, Premier League, English Football League, Keir Starmer, Lisa Nandy, Rachel Reeves\\nEVENT: UK's pick for football regulator chair, David Kogan, addresses concerns about political bias due to Labour donations, emphasizing independence and a 'light touch' approach.\\nCONTEXT: Regulator aims to balance oversight with fostering football's growth and competitiveness.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 47803, 'sourceId': 918, 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/07/disability-benefit-cuts-to-hit-700000-families-already-in-poverty-dwp-forecasts-show', 'title': 'Disability benefit cuts to hit 700,000 families already in poverty, DWP forecasts show', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T14:00:47.000Z', 'content': 'The government’s planned disability benefit cuts will hit 700,000 families who are already in poverty, according to internal Department for Work and Pensions forecasts obtained by the Guardian.The figures, sourced under the Freedom of Information Act, are in addition to the projected 250,000 people who will be newly driven below the poverty line by the cuts, as set out by the government’s impact assessment in March.Disability rights campaigners called the new disclosure “truly shocking” and said the changes would push people even further away from having the means to find work.The DWP estimates that 3.2 million families across Great Britain will lose out under the plans in 2029/2030, about three years after the cuts are due to take effect. Of those, 700,000 will be families already categorised as being in relative poverty, when taking housing costs into account.Disquiet is growing among Labour MPs before the vote on changes to personal independence payments (Pip), which are paid to disabled people regardless of whether they are in work, and which will have strict new criteria. In total, around 3 million people are expected to see their benefits affected.Mark Harrison of campaign group Disabled People Against Cuts said it was “unthinkable to push disabled people already in poverty deeper into the mire and further away from the jobs market”.He said: “You can’t [overestimate] the fear that these proposed cuts are generating. Rachel Reeves and Liz Kendall are responsible for demonising disabled people in the same way David Cameron and George Osborne did over a decade ago. This is bad politics and bad policymaking. They should be ashamed of themselves.”He said the government must scrap the planned cuts. “If they don’t, this will become Starmer’s poll tax and will ultimately be his downfall.”The figures do not take into account the DWP’s planned £1bn investment in disability employment support schemes, because the DWP has not published any estimate of how many disabled people will find work through these schemes, and the Office for Budget Responsibility won’t publish its own independent forecast until MPs have voted on the cuts.Key to the planned changes is the tightening of the criteria for Pip, meaning applicants who do not score four points or above in at least one criteria in the “daily living” category will not receive the Pip daily living payment. That included people who cannot wash themselves below the waist.It will not immediately affect those who already claim, but will affect those reapplying or being reassessed after the new rules come into force, as well as new applicants.For those who cannot not work because of their disability and who are receiving the health-related top-up of universal credit, these payments will be frozen below inflation. The top-up for new claimants will be cut by almost half.“Being disabled already puts you at a higher risk of living in poverty,” said Katie Schmuecker, principal policy adviser at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. “These cuts are likely to mean many more disabled people needing to regularly use food banks because they can’t afford basic essentials like food … The government must stop these planned cuts if it’s committed to ending the moral scar of food bank use.”MPs will vote on the cuts next month so that they can take effect next year. The proposed Pip “four-point rule” alone is forecast to hit 250,000 families already in poverty by 2030, including 50,000 with children, according to DWP responses to written parliamentary questions. The families will lose out on £4,500 a year on average.The 700,000 figure does not include people who will lose carer’s allowance if the person they cared for no longer qualified for Pip.Alongside the cuts, there will be a rise in the standard rate of universal credit, which the DWP expects 2.4 million families in poverty to benefit from, though it will be mostly non-disabled families who gain about £400 a year above inflation.Svetlana Kotova, director of campaigns and justice at Inclusion London, a deaf and disabled people’s organisation, said: “These statistics are further evidence of how much misery the government is willing to inflict on disabled people who are already living in poverty.“Poverty costs money and displaces costs on to other services like the NHS, meaning that the cuts to social security may achieve only 2% of their planned savings.”A government spokesperson said: “Our reforms to the broken welfare system we inherited means more than 2 million families in relative poverty will be better off.“As part of our plan for change, we’re creating a sustainable welfare system that genuinely supports people into work and out of poverty – backed by £1bn additional employment support funding to guarantee tailored help.“Alongside this, we’ve increased the ‘national living wage’, uprated benefits, and are helping over 1 million households by introducing a fair repayment rate on universal credit deductions.”', 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Disability benefit cuts hit poor families\\nENTITIES: DWP, Rachel Reeves, Liz Kendall, David Cameron, George Osborne, Starmer, Joseph Rowntree Foundation, Svetlana Kotova, Inclusion London\\nEVENT: Planned disability benefit cuts will impact 700,000 impoverished families, in addition to 250,000 newly below poverty line.\\nCONTEXT: Cuts will affect 3.2 million families, 700,000 already in poverty.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 51740, 'sourceId': 12696, 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/07/acerbi-goal-crazy-inter-warriors-champions-league', 'title': 'Acerbi’s preposterous goal summed up ‘crazy Inter’s’ last-chance warriors', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T12:54:08.000Z', 'content': 'What was he even doing there, in the 183rd minute of a two-legged tie, a 37-year-old centre-back attacking the opposition’s six-yard box, the furthest man forward on his team? Francesco Acerbi had not scored a goal in more than a year. Heck, he had not scored one in 65 appearances across Uefa club competitions. This is not his job, not the thing he trains for, not a defining moment anyone had predicted for the most entertaining Champions League semi-final ever to unfold.Or maybe this is the only way it could be. “Pazza Inter Amala” runs the line from Inter’s club anthem. “Crazy Inter, Love Her”. This is not Real Madrid, where “being successful is part of our DNA”, nor Juventus lecturing you that “winning is the only thing that counts”. Inter make sense when they stop making sense. Acerbi – yes, that Acerbi, who overcame cancer twice and who has won all seven major trophies of his career since turning 30, smashing a striker’s finish into the top corner to make it 6-6 on aggregate and force extra time? Of course. How else did you imagine this could go?To be clear, we are not talking about luck or random chance. Inter are heading to their second Champions League final in three years because they are one of the very best football teams on the planet. They have players like Lautaro Martínez, who has scored every 85 minutes in this season’s competition, and bagged another, as well as winning a penalty, on Tuesday, just six days after he limped out of the first leg with a hamstring strain. Their manager, Simone Inzaghi, has proven himself to be one of the most tactically sophisticated coaches going, with flexible and ambitious systems that allow players freedom built on trust and communication.And yet these two games against Barcelona appeared to have arrived at the worst possible moment. Inter ended April losing three domestic games in succession by a combined scoreline of 5-0. Those results cost them top spot in Serie A, as well as eliminating them from the Coppa Italia. The best team in Italy was – still is – at risk of ending this season with no silverware at all.Being blunt, they looked knackered – worn down by a relentless schedule. Inter’s starting XI against Bayern Munich for the second leg of the quarter-final was the oldest deployed by any team so far in this season’s Champions League, with an average age of 31.1. They are the senior citizens of Serie A too, and have used the fewest players.The tactical brilliance of Simone Inzaghi (centre) and the bravery, desire and ruthlessness of Lautaro Martínez (left) give Inter many dimensions. Photograph: Jonathan Moscrop/Getty ImagesWith experience, however, a greater self-awareness can emerge. Inter have delivered far better performances under Inzaghi than we saw against Barcelona or Bayern. There were uncharacteristic mistakes: tactical and individual. They conceded as many times in four games as they had in the past two seasons of the competition combined. Yet they were also unshakeable, holding their nerve and responding every time. Away to Bayern, Inter let a lead slip then immediately re-established it through Davide Frattesi. In the return game, Harry Kane’s opener drawing quick-fire replies from Martínez and Benjamin Pavard. Against Barcelona, they went from 2-0 to 2-2 on both occasions, then 3-2 to 3-3 in each direction.A less determined side would have crumpled when Lamine Yamal was making magic and the stands were shaking in the first leg at Montjuïc. A less unflappable player than Acerbi might let himself be drawn into a self-defeating reaction when Iñigo Martínez appeared to spit in his direction after Hakan Calhanoglu put Inter 5-3 up on aggregate before half-time.But as the two-time Champions League winning manager Arrigo Sacchi observed recently, the thing that makes this Inter special is the fact this team “has grown up over time”. Seven out of 11 starters on Tuesday were in the team that lined up to face Manchester City in the final two years ago.Inter know what it takes to win these games because they have been here before. That is an extraordinary reflection on Inzaghi. When he took charge in 2021, they had not played a Champions League knockout game for 10 years. He led them to the last 16 at the first time of asking, losing to Liverpool but winning the away leg at Anfield: a match people connected to the club still often point to as an essential first step.Davide Frattesi, the match-winner against Barcelona, says his greatest quality is never giving up. Photograph: Pier Marco Tacca/Getty ImagesThey have learned the hard way that these moments cannot be taken for granted. Inter were arguably a better team – certainly a more consistent one – last season, but threw away a winning position against Atlético Madrid and went out before the quarter-finals. At full time on Tuesday, Martínez talked about how desperate he had been to play despite his injury, saying he “spent two days crying at home”. Frattesi, who scored the winning goal in extra time, revealed he too had been struggling with an abdominal strain unknown to reporters before the game. “I need to thank the physios,” he said. “I’m dedicating this win and my goal to them.” Frattesi celebrated his goal so hard he almost passed out. “I was lucky to finish the match,” he said. “When I stopped screaming I could only see black.”Acerbi and Frattesi have had different parts to play at Inter this season; one a starter and leader, the other a player who has struggled to carve out a regular spot since signing from Sassuolo in a €30m deal two years ago. In another way, though, they are two sides of the same coin. Each has spoken candidly about how their grief at the death of family members – Acerbi his father, Frattesi his grandmother – had a knock-on impact on the pitch. One is 12 years older than the other, but both have played this Champions League campaign with the urgency of people who know they might not get another chance as good as this one.“I’m not an incredible talent,” said Frattesi on Tuesday, “but I never give up.

I open Netflix, looking for something, anything, to distract me from the world. I stumble upon a trailer for a series that I had vaguely heard of before, but knew next to nothing about. That series was Drive to Survive, and, seeing as how it first premiered in 2019, multiple seasons were available to watch. I pressed play. And before I knew it, I\\'d watched every episode available.\\nBut discovering the world of Formula 1 via Drive to Survive opened me to a world that I may not have known anything about, but suddenly couldn\\'t get enough of. I was fascinated by this sport that had captivated a worldwide audience, and was so cutthroat that I could barely keep track of who was driving for whom from race to race or season to season. (Miss you, Daniel Ricciardo.) I suddenly found myself able to understand what \"DRS\" meant, and before I knew it, I was liking every single TikTok related to Toto Wolff that I could get my eyes on.\\nSo, this year, when I received an email in my inbox asking to potentially attend and consider covering the Miami Grand Prix (May 2-4, 2025) for BuzzFeed, I let out a little yelp. And, when the stars aligned and made it so it could actually happen, I spent a week in southern Florida to attend the Miami Grand Prix.\\nWhile Formula 1 is not new to the world or to the United States, it\\'s experienced a resurgence as of late and now has multiple races in the United States. (It actually shocked me to learn that there once was a Formula 1 race in my home state of Indiana. Kind of iconic.) Prior to 2012, there was a hiatus for Formula 1 races in the United States, but since then, three have been added, with a rumored but unverified fourth potentially coming in Chicago.\\nIf you\\'re new to Formula 1 as I once was, or if you\\'re a seasoned fan who has yet to make it to the Miami Grand Prix, I\\'m here to give you a full breakdown of my weekend.\\nFirst things first...where to stay.\\nWhile it is branded as the \"Miami\" Grand Prix, the Miami International Autodrome is located about 17 miles north of Miami in Miami Gardens, FL. So if you\\'re thinking about going, you don\\'t have to stay in Miami to make it to the race, but you also can stay in Miami because there are many shuttle options available for fans. And who wouldn\\'t want to stay in Miami?\\nSo while I did fly into Miami for the event, I ended up staying at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Hollywood, FL, and it would have been closer to fly into Fort Lauderdale. The Hard Rock Hotel & Casino is only about 10 miles from the Miami International Autodrome where the race is held, and it\\'s also right across the street from one of the largest shuttle areas provided free of charge (and running every 15 minutes) for fans — Lot 70.\\nBack to the hotel. The Hard Rock Hotel & Casino is HUGE. I had never been before, and let me tell you, when I first walked in, I was *overwhelmed.* I got to stay in the GUITAR HOTEL, which is exactly as it sounds: A hotel shaped like a giant guitar. It\\'s a sight to see in person, and you can see it from miles away. I arrived late on a Tuesday night before race weekend after a long flight and rental car mishaps. The hotel offers free parking, so after I got my car parked and luggage out, I made my way inside, only to realize that this complex was huge.\\nAnd, as you can see, the Hard Rock was definitely a place for fans to gather, with a Red Bull car in the lobby for fans to admire (but not touch, duh).\\nAnd here\\'s a look at my deluxe King room with a pool view, located on the 14th floor. I had absolutely zero complaints about this room. There was a robe to use, room service available, a very comfortable bed with crisp white sheets, an amazingly spacious shower, and somehow the windows were soundproof enough that a full concert at the pool just 14 floors below wasn\\'t enough to disturb my slumber.\\nWhile the actual grand prix is on Sunday, per usual, the Miami Grand Prix offers a full weekend(+, tbh) of activities for fans and spectators. Starting with events on Friday, a Sprint race and qualifying on Saturday, and F1 Academy races and practices throughout the weekend, there is no shortage of things to experience.\\nWhile I was offered a Paddock pass to cover from a media perspective — more on this later — my boyfriend actually accompanied me to Miami on his own dime and bought a general campus pass for the weekend, which, as you can see below, came at the price of $430 for all three days (or $350 just for Sunday). This included access to the campus every day, but no actual stadium seats. If you want to be able to sit and watch the cars go by in front of you, a campus pass is not the best option. While there are spots to watch the actual track from the general campus, and TVs to see the actual race, the ability to see the track and race itself is best viewed via the stadium or one of the (expensive, but very cool) VIP-like options such as the Paddock Club, or the MIA Marina.\\nHaving access to the Paddock was a dream come true. I\\'m not going to sit here and lie to you. I felt absolutely giddy all weekend, brushing shoulders with influencers and celebrities alike while seeing Lando Norris quickly walk by to get to the McLaren garage. But it was also a reminder of the level of wealth that can be associated with Formula 1. I mean, these cars cost hundreds of millions of dollars to make. The drivers themselves make so much money I can\\'t even think about it, and there is a worldwide fanbase that encompasses so much wealth it almost makes you quiver to think about it. While it\\'s easy to think about billionaires when you think about Formula 1, I also think about the fans who may have stumbled into this world and are just there to connect with other fans and experience something they may have dreamt about for years.\\nThe Miami Grand Prix is truly a star-studded event, especially if you have access to the Paddock or the Paddock Club. I saw Patrick Mahomes, Jason Oppenheim, Timothée Chalamet, Stassi Schroeder, and DJ Khaled, to name a few. Obviously, I was most excited about Stassi as I would recognize a reality TV star anywhere.\\nI spent a lot of my time in the Paddock, because how could you not? It has direct access to the team garages, you even get free coffee...As I found out when I took out my credit card to pay for my iced oat milk vanilla latte and they shook their head and essentially said girlie pop it\\'s free back here.\\nThe paddock also had a ton of places to lounge, and bathrooms that were not porta-potties, so you bet your bottom dollar I took advantage of the sheer luck of me being allowed back there. And as I mentioned before, you actually can see all the drivers back there if you time it right. If in the future I ever have the funds — aka a few thousand to spare — I would 100% splurge on Paddock access because I cannot tell you the rush I felt when I saw Charles LeClerc (very quickly) walk by in the vicinity before the race. It really was everything that was promised and more.\\nThe Miami Grand Prix also has a ton to offer outside of just the race. The Miami Autodrome is huge, and you would be making a mistake to wear any shoes that you cannot walk comfortably in. I was walking 10k+ steps a day, just going around looking at all the food/beverage options and the fan experiences.\\nAs for the bathrooms, well, get ready to use a porta-potty if you have a general campus pass. But I will say, I\\'ve peed in worse places. There are levels to porta-potties, and these were some of the nicer ones.\\nPorta-potties don\\'t faze me at this point, but I was a bit shocked upon seeing the prices for merch. I naively didn\\'t pack a hat (despite knowing the Florida sun could be intense) because I thought I would just purchase one at the event. I was trying to decide if I wanted to go all in on a Ferrari hat to support Lewis Hamilton\\'s new team, or if I would throw Williams some support. That is...until I saw the prices. The cheapest hat I saw cost $70, but this was in line with their prices for other merch as well.\\nHere\\'s some other shots of merchandise:\\nAnd some more:\\nOne of the best parts of the whole experience for me was getting to do a Pit Lane walk. This was offered to anyone with a Paddock Club pass, which, as it turns out, was a lot of people, as I was absolutely surrounded on all sides, but I cannot tell you how incredible it was to see these cars and crews up close. There\\'s obviously always a lot of focus on the drivers, but the engineering, data, and work from hundreds of thousands of people behind the scenes that go into making these machines is beyond comprehension. It\\'s an experience I will treasure for years to come.\\nNow, enough of me being extra lucky with my paddock pass, let\\'s talk about food and beverage...\\nI was pleasantly surprised by just how many food and beverage options there were. I mean, I felt like it never ended! It was genuinely hard to decide what to eat and drink. There were a ton of local Florida food vendors and a ton of options to keep you cool on hot, humid Florida days. You can see some of the options below.\\nAnd even if I felt like the merch prices were more than I expected, the food prices felt pretty in line with other sporting events I\\'ve attended. I mean, have you seen the drink prices at the US Open?!\\nI do regret not trying the arepa stand. Next time...\\nI got a spicy tuna poke bowl, which cost $24, but $31.10 with tip, and it was honestly very good.\\nAnd the frosted lemonade was so good.\\nAt the end of my race weekend, on Sunday afternoon, I left the paddock to venture out into the general area to see what it would be like to watch the race. I grabbed a bite to eat, ventured into the Food Garage, and watched the Miami Grand Prix on a TV surrounded by other fans. There were loud cheers, smiles ear-to-ear, and general camaraderie. Even though we couldn\\'t physically see the track as well as those with stadium seats, we could hear it. Honestly, I thought it might feel disappointing at first, but it was perfect.\\nI don\\'t know if I\\'ll ever be lucky enough to attend a Formula 1 Grand Prix with a paddock pass again, but I will truthfully cherish this experience for the foreseeable future. Is it expensive? Yes. Was I absolutely exhausted by the end of the weekend? Also yes.\\nBut there\\'s something magical about getting to see a Formula 1 race in real life.\\nBuzzFeed was provided a Paddock pass free of charge but was under no obligation to provide positive coverage.', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Miami Grand Prix: Travel Guide and First Impressions\\nENTITIES: Formula 1, Miami Grand Prix, Miami International Autodrome, Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino\\nEVENT: The author attends and covers the Miami Grand Prix, detailing the experience from lodging and transportation to paddock access and food options.\\nCONTEXT: Provides a first-timer's perspective and travel guide to the Miami Grand Prix, including lodging, activities, and costs.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 49525, 'sourceId': 12511, 'url': 'https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Cloud-storage-for-AI-Options-pros-and-cons', 'title': 'Cloud storage for AI: Options, pros and cons', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T09:58:00.000Z', 'content': 'By\\nStephen Pritchard\\nPublished: 07 May 2025\\nIT architects tasked with the design of storage systems for artificial intelligence (AI) need to balance capacity, performance and cost.\\nAI systems, especially those based on large language models (LLMs), consume vast amounts of data. In fact, LLMs or generative AI (GenAI) models often work better the more data they have. The training phase of AI in particular is very data hungry.\\nThe inference phase of AI, however, needs high performance to avoid AI systems that feel unresponsive or fail to work at all. They need throughput and low latency.\\nSo, a key question is, to what extent can we use a mix of on-premise and cloud storage? On-premise storage brings higher performance and greater security. Cloud storage offers the ability to scale, lower costs and potentially, better integration with cloud-based AI models and cloud data sources.\\nIn this article, we look at the pros and cons of each and how best to optimise them for storage for AI.\\nAI storage: On-premise vs cloud?\\nEnterprises typically look to on-premise storage for the best speed, performance and security – and AI workloads are no exception. Local storage can also be easier to fine tune to the needs of AI models, and will likely suffer less from network bottlenecks.\\nThen there are the advantages of keeping AI models close to source data. For enterprise applications, this is often a relational database that runs on block storage.\\nAs a result, systems designers need to consider the impact of AI on the performance of a system of record. The business will not want key packages such as ERP or CRM slowed down because they also feed data into an AI system. There are also strong security, privacy and compliance reasons for keeping core data records on site rather than moving them to the cloud.\\nEven so, cloud storage also offers advantages for AI projects. Cloud storage is easy to scale, and customers only pay for what they use. For some AI use cases, source data will already be in the cloud, in a data lake or a cloud-based, SaaS application, for example.\\nCloud storage is largely based around object storage, which is well-suited to the unstructured data which makes up the bulk of information consumed by large language models.\\nAt the same time, the growth of storage systems that can run object storage on-premise makes it easier for enterprises to have a single storage layer – even a single global namespace – to serve on-premise and cloud infrastructure, including AI. This is especially relevant for firms that expect to move workloads between local and cloud infrastructure, or operate “hybrid” systems.\\nAI storage, and cloud options\\nCloud storage is often the first choice for enterprises that want to run AI proofs-of-concept (PoCs). It removes the need for up-front capital investment and can be spun down at the end of the project.\\nIn other cases, firms have designed AI systems to “burst” from the datacentre to the cloud. This makes use of public cloud resources for compute and storage to cover peaks in demand. Bursting is most effective for AI projects with relatively short peak workloads, such as those that run on a seasonal business cycle.\\nBut the arrival of generative AI based on large language models has tipped the balance more towards cloud storage simply because of the data volumes involved.\\nAt the same time, cloud providers now offer a wider range dedicated data storage options focused on AI workloads. This includes storage provision tailored to different stages of an AI workload, namely: prepare, train, serve and archive.\\nAs Google’s engineers put it: “Each stage in the ML [machine learning] lifecycle has different storage requirements. For example, when you upload the training dataset, you might prioritise storage capacity for training and high throughput for large datasets. Similarly, the training, tuning, serving and archiving stages have different requirements”\\nAlthough this is written for Google Cloud Platform, the same principles apply to Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services. All three hyperscalers, plus vendors such as IBM and Oracle, offer cloud-based storage suitable for the bulk storage requirements of AI. For the most part, unstructured data used by AI, including source material and training data, will likely be held in object storage.\\nThis could be AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud’s Cloud Storage. In addition, third-party software platforms, such as NetApp’s ONTAP are also available from the hyperscalers, and can improve data portability between cloud and on-premise operations.\\nFor the production, or inference stage, of AI operations, the choices are often even more complex. IT architects can specify NVMe and SSD storage with different performance tiers for critical parts of the AI workflow. Older “spinning disk” storage remains on offer for tasks such as initial data ingest and preparation, or for archiving AI system outputs.\\nThis type of storage is also application neutral: IT architects can specify their performance parameters and budget for AI as they can for any other workload. But a new generation of cloud storage is designed from the ground up for AI.\\nAdvanced cloud storage for AI\\nThe specific demands of AI has prompted storage vendors to design dedicated infrastructure to avoid bottlenecks in AI workflows, some of which are found in on-prem systems but also in the cloud. Key among them are two approaches: parallelism and direct GPU memory access.\\nParallelism allows storage systems to handle what storage supplier Cloudian describes as “the concurrent data requests characteristic of AI and ML workloads”. This makes model training and inference faster. In this way, AI storage systems are enabled to handle multiple data streams in parallel.\\nAn example here is Google’s Parallelstore, which launched last year to provide a managed parallel file storage service aimed at intensive input/output for artificial intelligence applications.\\nGPU access to memory, meanwhile, sets out to remove bottlenecks between storage cache and GPUs – GPUs are expensive and can be scarce. According to John Woolley, chief commercial officer at vendor Insurgo Media, storage must deliver at least 10GBps of sustained throughput to prevent “GPU starvation”.\\nProtocols such as GPUDirect – developed by Nvidia – allow GPUs to access NVMe drive memory directly, similarly to the way RDMA allows direct access between systems without involving CPU or the OS. It also goes by the name DGS or Direct GPU Support (DGS).\\nLocal cache layers between the GPU and shared storage can use block storage on NVMe SSDs to provide “bandwidth saturation” to each GPU, at 60GBps or more. As a result, cloud suppliers plan a new generation of SSD, optimised for DGS and likely to be based on SLC NAND.\\n“Inference workloads require a combination of traditional enterprise bulk storage and AI-optimised DGS storage,” says Sebastien Jean, CTO at Phison US, a NAND manufacturer. “The new GPU-centric workload requires small I/O access and very low latency.”\\nAs a result, the market is likely to see more AI-optimised storage systems, including those with Nvidia DGX BasePod and SuperPod certification, and AI integration.\\nOptions include Nutanix Enterprise AI, Pure’s Evergreen One for AI, Dell PowerScale, Vast’s Vast Data Platform, Weka, a cloud hybrid NAS provider, and offerings from HPE, Hitachi Vantara, IBM and NetApp.\\nRead more on Datacentre capacity planning\\nStorage players ride the Nvidia bus at GTC 2025\\nBy: Antony\\xa0Adshead\\nGPU scarcity shifts focus to GPUaaS\\nBy: Adam\\xa0Armstrong\\nStorj buys Valdi for cloud compute to bolster storage offers\\nBy: Tim\\xa0McCarthy\\nStorage vendors work with Nvidia to broaden AI portfolio\\nBy: Adam\\xa0Armstrong', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Cloud vs On-Premise Storage for AI Systems\\nENTITIES: Google, Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, IBM, Oracle, NetApp, Nvidia, Cloudian, Insurgo Media, Phison US, Nutanix, Pure, Dell, Vast, Weka, HPE, Hitachi Vantara\\nEVENT: The article discusses on-premise vs cloud storage for AI, cloud storage options, advanced cloud storage for AI, parallelism, and direct GPU memory access.\\nCONTEXT: AI storage systems balance capacity, performance, and cost.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 49579, 'sourceId': 12524, 'url': 'https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/mitsubishi-bev-2026/', 'title': 'Mitsubishi’s back in the EV game—with a new electric SUV coming in 2026', 'publishDate': '2025-05-08T05:21:01.000Z', 'content': 'Mitsubishi Motors Momentum 2030 Lineup\\nImage used with permission by copyright holder\\nMitsubishi is officially jumping back into the U.S. electric vehicle scene—and this time, it’s not just dipping a toe. The company confirmed it will launch a brand-new battery-electric SUV in North America starting in summer 2026, marking its first fully electric model here since the quirky little i-MiEV\\xa0left the stage back in 2017.\\nThe new EV will be a compact crossover, and while Mitsubishi is keeping most of the juicy details under wraps, we do know it’ll be based on the same next-gen platform as the upcoming Nissan Leaf. That means it’ll ride on the CMF-EV architecture—the same one underpinning the Nissan Ariya—which supports ranges of up to 300+ miles. So yeah, this won’t be your average entry-level EV.\\nRecommended Videos\\nDesigned in partnership with Nissan, the new model will be built in Japan and shipped over to U.S. shores. No word yet on pricing, battery size, or even a name, but Mitsubishi has made it clear this EV is just the beginning. As part of its “Momentum 2030” plan, the company promises a new or updated vehicle every year through the end of the decade, with four electric models rolling out by 2028. And yes, one of those might even be a pickup.\\nMitsubishi says the goal is to give customers “flexible powertrain options,” which is marketing speak for: “We’ll have something for everyone.” So whether you’re all-in on electric or still into gas or hybrid power, they’re aiming to have you covered.\\nThis mystery EV will eventually sit alongside Mitsubishi’s current U.S. lineup—the Outlander, Outlander PHEV, Eclipse Cross, and Outlander Sport—and help the brand move beyond its current under-the-radar status in the electric world.\\nIn short: Mitsubishi’s finally getting serious about EVs, and if this new SUV lives up to its potential, it might just put the brand back on your radar.\\nNick Godt has covered global business news on three continents for over 25 years.\\nCars\\nThe new Omoda 7 is real and so is that amazing 745 mile range\\nThe Auto Shanghai 2025 motor show has revealed a lot of gems but one stand-out model, from a sub-brand of Chery, is the Omoda 7.\\nThis compact SUV is built with a new PHEV drive system called the Super Hybrid System (SHS) which can deliver a massive 745 miles of range.\\nRead more\\nCars\\nSlate Unveils $20K Electric Truck That Transforms Into an SUV\\nSlate Automotive, a new American EV startup, has just unveiled its first vehicle: a radically minimalist electric truck that can convert into a five-seat SUV. Dubbed the “Blank Slate,” the EV made its debut this week, instantly turning heads not just for its versatility but for its incredibly low price—starting under $20,000 after federal tax incentives.\\nUnlike Tesla and Lucid, which launched with high-priced luxury models, Slate wants to flip the model: start cheap, scale up.\\nAt its core, the Slate Truck is a utilitarian, two-seat electric pickup designed for simplicity and affordability. But what sets it apart is its transformative potential. Thanks to a modular accessory system, the truck can be upgraded over time—including a kit that adds a rear seat, roll cage, airbags, and SUV body panels. This means buyers can start with a minimalist pickup and evolve it into a family-friendly SUV—either themselves or through Slate’s growing network of service partners.\\nCustomization is central to Slate’s vision. Owners will be able to choose from over 100 accessories at launch, ranging from vinyl wraps and Bluetooth-ready audio systems to larger battery packs and off-road upgrades. The company encourages a DIY approach, offering tools and tutorials through “Slate University” to empower users to modify and maintain their own vehicles.\\nPowering the truck is a 52.7-kWh battery for up to 150 miles of range, or an optional 84.3-kWh pack targeting 240 miles. Fast-charging capabilities and Tesla’s NACS port come standard. The vehicle is rear-wheel-drive and delivers around 200 horsepower—enough for urban commuting and light-duty hauling.\\nWhat enables the low price is Slate’s stripped-down approach to manufacturing. There’s no paint shop, no stamping, and only one trim level—everything else is modular. The vehicle features steel wheels, crank windows, and a rugged plastic body designed to take a beating and still look good. It’s a rejection of the tech-saturated, high-cost vehicles dominating today’s market.\\nDespite the minimalist specs, Slate isn’t skimping on safety. The truck is engineered to meet top crash test ratings and comes equipped with up to eight airbags, active emergency braking, and forward collision warning.\\nBacking this ambitious approach is significant investor support—including Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos. That backing, combined with a simplified production model, positions Slate to scale quickly once production begins in 2026.\\nReservations are now open for $50 at slate.auto, with deliveries expected in late 2026. Whether Americans are ready for a stripped-down, shape-shifting EV remains to be seen, but Slate’s bet on affordability and customization could make it one of the most disruptive entries in the EV market to date.\\nRead more\\nCars\\nWaymo and Toyota explore personally owned self-driving cars\\nWaymo and Toyota have announced they’re exploring a strategic collaboration—and one of the most exciting possibilities on the table is bringing fully-automated driving technology to personally owned vehicles.\\nAlphabet-owned Waymo has made its name with its robotaxi service, the only one currently operating in the U.S. Its vehicles, including Jaguars and Hyundai Ioniq 5s, have logged tens of millions of autonomous miles on the streets of San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Austin.\\nBut shifting to personally owned self-driving cars is a much more complex challenge.\\nWhile safety regulations are expected to loosen under the Trump administration, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has so far taken a cautious approach to the deployment of fully autonomous vehicles. General Motors-backed Cruise robotaxi was forced to suspend operations in 2023 following a fatal collision.\\nWhile the partnership with Toyota is still in the early stages, Waymo says it will initially study how to merge its autonomous systems with the Japanese automaker’s consumer vehicle platforms.\\nIn a recent call with analysts, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai signaled that Waymo is seriously considering expanding beyond ride-hailing fleets and into personal ownership. While nothing is confirmed, the partnership with Toyota adds credibility—and manufacturing muscle—to that vision.\\nToyota brings decades of safety innovation to the table, including its widely adopted Toyota Safety Sense technology. Through its software division, Woven by Toyota, the company is also pushing into next-generation vehicle platforms. With Waymo, Toyota is now also looking at how automation can evolve beyond assisted driving and into full autonomy for individual drivers.\\nThis move also turns up the heat on Tesla, which has long promised fully self-driving vehicles for consumers. While Tesla continues to refine its Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, it remains supervised and hasn’t yet delivered on full autonomy. CEO Elon Musk is promising to launch some of its first robotaxis in Austin in June.\\nWhen it comes to self-driving cars, Waymo and Tesla are taking very different roads. Tesla aims to deliver affordability and scale with its camera, AI-based software. Waymo, by contrast, uses a more expensive technology relying on pre-mapped roads, sensors, cameras, radar and lidar (a laser-light radar), that regulators have been quicker to trust.\\nRead more', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Mitsubishi to launch electric SUV in 2026\\nENTITIES: Mitsubishi, Nissan, Nissan Leaf, Nissan Ariya\\nEVENT: Mitsubishi will launch a new battery-electric compact SUV in North America in summer 2026, based on the Nissan Leaf's platform, with a target range of 300+ miles.\\nCONTEXT: Mitsubishi aims to re-enter the EV market with a compact SUV based on Nissan's CMF-EV platform, signaling a broader commitment to electric vehicles.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 54289, 'sourceId': 12343, 'url': 'https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2025/05/07/exclusive-details-dr-gorka-on-how-trump-is-besting-media-with-shock-and-awe-strategy/', 'title': \"Exclusive Details: Dr. Gorka on How Trump Is Besting Media with 'Shock and Awe' Strategy\", 'publishDate': '2025-05-08T01:54:57.000Z', 'content': 'On Wednesday’s “Alex Marlow Show,”\\xa0Dr. Sebastian Gorka, Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Counterterrorism at the National Security Council discussed the Trump media strategy.\\nGorka said that while he was waiting to do an interview, there was “another correspondent in the next booth, waiting to do her [report], and it’s one of the alphabet soup, legacy cable news channels.

Judicial RaceThree counts showed that the incumbent, a Democrat, won the State Supreme Court election last fall. But Judge Jefferson Griffin tried for months to reverse his loss through the courts.Judge Jefferson Griffin said he would not appeal a federal court ruling that ordered the state elections board to certify the victory of the Democratic incumbent, Justice Allison Riggs.Credit...Robert Willett/The News & Observer, via Associated PressMay 7, 2025A six-month battle over a North Carolina Supreme Court seat ended on Wednesday when the Republican challenger, who had embarked on an extraordinary effort to throw out thousands of votes, conceded the race.The challenger, Judge Jefferson Griffin, said in a statement that he would not appeal a federal court ruling issued on Monday that ordered the state elections board to certify the victory of the Democratic incumbent, Justice Allison Riggs.ImageJustice Allison Riggs spoke at a rally in Raleigh, N.C., last month, where voters protested efforts by her opponent to overturn her election victory.Credit...Cornell Watson for The New York Times“While I do not fully agree with the District Court’s analysis, I respect the court’s holding — just as I have respected every judicial tribunal that has heard this case,” Mr. Griffin said. “I will not appeal the court’s decision.”Two recounts affirmed that Justice Riggs won the race by a margin of 734 votes, out of the more than 5.5 million ballots cast. The results of the race are the last in the nation to be certified from the 2024 election.“After millions of dollars spent, more than 68,000 voters at risk of losing their votes, thousands of volunteers mobilized, hundreds of legal documents filed, and immeasurable damage done to our democracy, I’m glad the will of the voters was finally heard, six months and two days after Election Day,” Justice Riggs said in a statement.Judge Griffin, who currently sits on the North Carolina Court of Appeals, said on Wednesday that “as a judge, I believe everybody, myself included, has a right to their day in court.”“This effort,” he added, “has always been about upholding the rule of law and making sure that every legal vote in an election is counted.”The case tested the boundaries of post-election litigation, and drew criticism from democracy watchdog groups, liberals and even some conservatives across the state, who worried about setting a dangerous precedent.Politically, North Carolina is one of the most fractious states in the nation. Last fall, its voters handed the state to President Trump in the presidential race but elected a Democrat, Josh Stein, as governor. The Republican-controlled legislature has recently stripped power from Democratic officials, including taking away from the governor the power to appoint the members of the elections board and giving it instead to the state auditor, a Republican.Voting rights experts have said that regardless of the outcome, the unusual series of challenges from Judge Griffin, and the courts’ openness to entertaining them, may have paved the way for similar challenges in future close elections, as President Trump and his supporters try to erode confidence in the integrity of American elections.Judge Griffin began his fight by arguing that more than 65,000 ballots that were cast in the election should not be counted because of eligibility issues. He filed a protest with the State Board of Elections after the board twice certified Judge Riggs’s victory. (The total number of ballots in question fluctuated over time as the case wound its way through the election board and the courts.)Among the ballots Judge Griffin challenged were those cast by thousands of military and overseas voters, on the grounds that they had not submitted a photo ID or an ID exception form with their absentee ballots — even though the voters were exempted from those requirements before the election.Judge Griffin also challenged the ballots of nearly 300 voters who he said were “Never Residents,” meaning they did not live in North Carolina but were registered to vote there. The “Never Residents” category typically includes North Carolinians who are working overseas and the children of military parents from North Carolina who turn 18 while their family is stationed abroad. North Carolina passed a law in 2011 allowing such people to vote in the state’s elections.In April, the State Supreme Court, which has a 5-to-2 Republican majority, partially agreed with Judge Griffin, ruling that the eligibility of military and overseas voters who cast ballots in the election should be verified, and that the votes from “Never Residents” should be thrown out. Justice Riggs, who has recused herself from the case, appealed the ruling to the federal courts.Lawyers for Judge Griffin said they were trying to enforce laws that the Board of Elections had failed to apply. The North Carolina Republican Party supported Judge Griffin’s challenge. Matt Mercer, a spokesman for the state party, said in a statement that “Judge Griffin deserves the appreciation of every North Carolinian for highlighting the appalling mismanagement” of the state elections board.Judge Griffin’s critics noted that the ballots in question were included in certified counts for every other race in the state last November, and likened his challenge to trying to change the rules after the game has been played.The federal judge — a Trump appointee — who ordered the elections board on Monday to certify the race agreed with that argument. He ruled that the “retroactive invalidation” of military and overseas ballots would be a violation of those voters’ due process rights.The stakes in the race were high. North Carolina’s legislative district maps are among the most gerrymandered in the country — they now heavily favor Republicans — and the State Supreme Court decides whether to uphold or overturn them.As Judge Griffin persisted with his challenge and some courts accepted his argument, many of the affected voters grew concerned about the prospect of having to verify their ballots, and asked how doing that would even work, especially for members of the military stationed overseas and their families.Billboards across the state, sponsored by voting rights groups, labeled Judge Griffin a power-hungry election stealer. Thousands of protesters gathered in Raleigh, the state capitol, on several occasions, holding up signs that read “She won!” and “Stop the steal!”Anderson Clayton, the chairwoman of the North Carolina Democratic Party, said in a statement on Wednesday that Justice Riggs’s victory belonged “to every voter who deserves confidence that their voice will be heard when they cast their ballot.”Jeff Jackson, the attorney general of North Carolina, whose office led the legal defense of the Board of Elections, said that from the beginning, Judge Griffin’s challenge “was an attempt to twist the law to reverse the outcome of a legitimate election.”“This attack didn’t work,\" Mr. Jackson said. “But there’s a real risk that other losing candidates might try the same attack in the future.”Eduardo Medina is a Times reporter covering the South.

Amazon has released an update for its Kindle app on iOS, adding a new \"Get Book\" button that directs users to purchase eBooks directly from the Kindle store. The e-commerce giant made this significant change following a recent court ruling against Apple, which forced Cupertino to open its mobile ecosystem to external payment options.\\nUntil recently, Apple required third-party iPhone and iPad developers to conduct in-app transactions through its internal payment system. However, litigation has changed this landscape, and now the company must allow external payment methods. Apps have started updating their offerings to include alternative payment platforms when available (... and without paying 30% to Apple).\\nWith the new \"Get Book\" option on the Kinde app, eBook readers can complete purchases through their preferred mobile web browser. While the process still requires some extra steps, it makes iPhone and iPad iOS Kindle apps more functional than before.\\nPreviously, Kindle customers had to leave the app, search for their desired eBook on Amazon\\'s website, complete the purchase, and then return to the app to sync the book. The new \"Get Book\" option still sends users outside the Kindle app to finish the transaction, but it\\'s a tighter integration.\\nAfter losing its legal battle with Epic Games, Apple revised its guidelines to permit third-party payment options in iOS apps. Spotify quickly took advantage by rolling out a payment service, and Amazon is now doing the same – though the change currently applies only to iOS users in the United States.\\nThe court\\'s decision seemingly hobbles the so-called \"Apple Tax\" – the 30 percent cut Apple takes from App Store and in-app purchases. However, it is still firmly in place for paid apps in the App Store and for developers choosing to use Cupertino\\'s payment platform.\\nMeanwhile, Apple has appealed the decision so a higher court could reverse the decision. Despite mounting scrutiny, Cupertino continues the fight to reinforce its tightly controlled ecosystem.\\nLawmakers may eventually force Apple to loosen its grip on the mobile app marketplace. A newly introduced Congressional bill – the App Store Freedom Act – aims to compel platform holders like Apple and Google to allow third-party app stores and sideloading by default rather than blocking them at the system level.', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Amazon Kindle app updates payment options on iOS\\nENTITIES: Amazon, Apple, Epic Games, Spotify\\nEVENT: Amazon updated its Kindle app on iOS to allow users to purchase eBooks directly from the Kindle store via a 'Get Book' button, bypassing Apple's in-app purchase system.\\nCONTEXT: The change follows a court ruling against Apple, forcing them to allow external payment options.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 47119, 'sourceId': 890, 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/us/politics/tyre-nichols-state-trial-officers-acquitted.html', 'title': 'Tyre Nichols Trial Verdict: 3 Former Memphis Officers Found Not Guilty in Fatal Beating', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T22:48:03.000Z', 'content': 'AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTYou have a preview view of this article while we are checking your access.

They were accused of fatally beating Mr. Nichols, a FedEx employee who had been driving home from work when he was stopped by officers more than two years ago.The three were convicted of witness tampering in a separate federal trial last fall, but acquitted of a more serious charge of violating Mr. Nichols’s civil rights by causing his death. Federal jurors also found Mr. Haley guilty of violating Mr. Nichols’s civil rights by causing bodily injury.Two other former officers involved in the beating — Desmond Mills Jr. and Emmitt Martin III — took guilty pleas in the earlier federal case; Mr. Mills also pleaded guilty in state court. It remains unclear how the state case against Mr. Martin, who has been described as the most violent officer in the beating, will be handled.The jury in the state case, seated from the Chattanooga area in eastern Tennessee to ensure a fair trial, deliberated more than eight hours after a seven-day trial in Memphis. In addition to second-degree murder, the three defendants had been charged with aggravated kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression.Sentencing in the federal trial is expected later this year. Mr. Nichols’s family has also sued Memphis and its Police Department.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Usually rather bulky and utilitarian, traditional satellite phones are typically required in remote locations where cellular networks are unavailable. Nowadays, however, satellite connectivity can be found in regular smartphones too, thanks to new hardware innovations and unique partnerships with satellite network providers.\\xa0They can\\'t fully replace traditional satellite phones, but in an emergency situation, this feature can be a real lifesaver. This kind of connectivity has already proven useful in rescuing people from Hurricanes Milton and Helene, the recent wildfires in Los Angeles and the deadly fires in Maui. There are also several reported cases of the Emergency SOS texting feature rescuing lost hikers. While satellite connectivity isn\\'t in every phone right now, it\\'s clear that there\\'s a real need for it, and don\\'t be surprised to see even more of this feature in years to come.\\xa0What is satellite connectivity in phones? Kevin Heinz/CNETIf a phone has satellite connectivity, it can connect to a satellite when you don\\'t have a cellular signal. This feature debuted in Apple\\'s iPhone 14 in 2022 and has since been incorporated in subsequent iPhones as well as certain Android phones like Google\\'s Pixel 9 and Samsung\\'s Galaxy S25. Some phones have satellite connectivity regardless of carrier for a period of time (like recent iPhones and the Pixel 9), while others require a specific carrier due to partnerships and hardware compatibility (like Galaxy S25 phones on Verizon).\\xa0Apple provides satellite connectivity in partnership with Globalstar, its affiliates and third-party network providers. However, Apple doesn\\'t provide satellite connectivity in models purchased in Armenia, Belarus, China, Hong Kong, Macao, Kazakhstan or Russia. Google partnered with Skylo for its satellite service, which currently works only in the continental US and on Pixel 9 devices.\\xa0Several US carriers have also recently started to provide satellite connectivity. Verizon, for example, has partnered with Skylo to provide its satellite messaging service to specific satellite-enabled phones like the Galaxy S25 and the Pixel 9 series. T-Mobile, on the other hand, has partnered with SpaceX\\'s Starlink, which uses a \"direct-to-cell\" technology that doesn\\'t require the phone to have a specialized satellite modem.\\xa0Regardless of the kind of satellite connectivity your phone has, it still needs one important thing to work properly: connection with a satellite. Not only are these satellites hundreds of miles away in space, but they also orbit the Earth at a quick pace. You definitely need to be outside for the best satellite connection possible. You also want a direct view of the sky and to be away from tall trees or heavy foliage. Even then, a message might take 30 seconds or more to send depending on the rest of your surroundings, the length of the message and the status of the satellite network.\\xa0How can I use satellite connectivity? Satellite connectivity on Android. James Martin/CNETThe most obvious benefit of satellite connectivity in phones is SOS messaging. Apple calls its service Emergency SOS, while Google calls its service Satellite SOS. Like the names suggest, these services let you contact an emergency dispatcher when you have no phone signal. Apple also added other related satellite connectivity features to its iPhones, such as Roadside Assistance via satellite and Send Location via satellite (via the Find My feature).\\xa0In 2024, Apple added a Messages via satellite feature to iOS 18 that allows iMessages or SMS messages to be sent and received by satellite to anyone, not just emergency services. It supports emoji, tapbacks, and iMessage bubbles and screen effects, but you can\\'t send or receive photos or videos, and it doesn\\'t support group chats. The recipient must also have iOS 18 or newer to receive iMessages (replying to an SMS message via satellite requires iOS 17.6 or later or a non-Apple phone). This works no matter which carrier you use for your phone.\\xa0Verizon customers who have either a Galaxy S25 or a Pixel 9 handset can send and receive text messages via satellite to any device, along with SOS emergency services. Those who use T-Mobile\\'s Starlink service, called T-Satellite, can send and receive messages to anyone as well. Right now, picture messaging, voice calls and data aren\\'t supported, but T-Mobile plans to add them soon.\\xa0One especially interesting aspect of T-Satellite, is that it\\'s open not just to T-Mobile customers but those from other carriers as well. The service is free for now during its beta trial period, but once the full service launches in July, and will remain free for T-Mobile customers on Go5G Next or Experience More plans. Otherwise, T-Satellite is $10 a month for T-Mobile customers on other plans, as well as for Verizon and AT&T customers.As of this writing, Verizon is offering its satellite messaging service for free. Apple and Google have both said they\\'ll provide their respective satellite services for free for the first two years. It\\'s unclear what happens after that, but Apple has previously extended satellite service for iPhone 14 owners.\\xa0How do I know if my phone has satellite connectivity? Emergency SOS might be one of the most important features to come out on any phone this year. Kevin Heinz/CNETAs of this writing, only certain phones come with built-in satellite connectivity. In the US this includes the iPhone 14 and newer, the Pixel 9 series as well as the Galaxy S25. The recent iPhones and the Pixel 9 series can connect to satellites when you lose your connection to a cellular network, while the Galaxy S25 requires a carrier like Verizon. The Pixel 9 can also use Verizon\\'s satellite service. These phones come with specialized hardware and satellite modems that enable satellite connectivity right off the bat.\\xa0Thanks to T-Mobile\\'s partnership with Starlink, however, more phones could have satellite connectivity even on existing hardware. T-Mobile\\'s Starlink satellite service (also known as T-Satellite) is currently compatible with \"satellite optimized\" phones such as the iPhone 14 and newer, the Pixel 9 series, the Motorola Razr Plus 2024, the Galaxy S24 and newer, the Galaxy A36 series, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and the Galaxy Z Fold 6. In this instance, \"satellite optimization\" simply means being able to seamlessly connect with a satellite in the absence of a cellular network.\\xa0You\\'ll know your phone has satellite connectivity if you can find the \"Satellite\" option in Settings or Control Center, usually when you\\'re out of Wi-Fi or cellular network coverage. There\\'ll often be a satellite icon or \"SAT\" symbol where the cellular symbol would be.\\xa0 Watch this: In-Depth Hands-On: I Tried Google\\'s Pixel 9 Satellite SOS\\n06:25Can I use satellite connectivity while having a cellular signal?No, you generally can\\'t have satellite and cellular connectivity at the same time. Satellite connectivity is designed to be used as a fallback when Wi-Fi or cellular networks are not available.\\xa0What are the limitations of satellite connectivity?At the moment, satellite connectivity is limited to text messaging, with no support for multimedia, voice calls or data. As mentioned earlier, there are also potential physical restrictions to contend with. If you\\'re indoors or under heavy foliage or you don\\'t have a clear line of sight of the sky, satellite connectivity could be an issue. There is also a lack of coverage in the water off the coasts.\\xa0Update, May 7: T-Satellite is free for T-Mobile customers on Go5G Next or Experience More plans and is $10 per month for other users on other T-Mobile plans and for Verizon and AT&T subscribers.', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Satellite Connectivity Expands to More Phones\\nENTITIES: Apple, Google, Verizon, T-Mobile, Globalstar, Skylo, SpaceX, Starlink\\nEVENT: Smartphones are increasingly incorporating satellite connectivity for emergency SOS and messaging, with partnerships between phone manufacturers, satellite providers, and carriers enabling this feature.

There is much we don\\'t know about the re-entry, including where it might land, but even if any of it does survive, 70% of the planet is covered by sea so it is unlikely to cause significant damage.\"It\\'s much more likely that you win the lottery than that you get impacted by this piece of space debris.\" said Mr Stijn Lemmens, Senior Space Debris Mitigation Analyst at the European Space Agency.The lander capsule is a tough, spherical object about a metre wide and weighs nearly half a tonne. It was built to survive the extreme heat and pressure of Venus\\'s atmosphere, meaning it has a robust heat shield and durable structure.This is why experts think it may survive an uncontrolled descent through Earth\\'s atmosphere.The parachute system, originally intended to slow the lander\\'s descent towards Venus, is likely long since degraded after more than 50 years in space.The risk to people on the ground is considered low, but the capsule\\'s projected flight path could see it land anywhere between 51.7° north and south latitude, covering most of the inhabited world.This means it could potentially land anywhere from as far north as London to as far south as the southern tip of South America.Uncontrolled space debris incidents have occurred before.Mr Lemmens explained that the \"re-entry of human-made objects into Earth\\'s atmosphere occurs quite frequently,\" happening weekly for bigger spacecraft and daily for smaller ones. Objects typically burn up in the earth\\'s atmosphere before they reach the ground. China\\'s Long March 5B booster re-entered over the Indian Ocean in 2022, and the Tiangong-1 space station mostly burned up over the Pacific in 2018.Kosmos 482 is now being closely tracked by international space agencies.Mr Lemmens said that future spacecraft \"should be designed in such a way that they can take themselves out of orbit safely, preferably by doing controlled re-entries\".This allows for precise predictions of landing locations, reducing the risk of any debris impacting populated areas, thereby protecting people and property while \"managing the environmental impact of space debris.\"', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Soviet spacecraft debris to fall to Earth\\nENTITIES: Soviet Union, Nasa, European Space Agency, Kosmos 482\\nEVENT: Soviet-era Kosmos 482 spacecraft expected to re-enter Earth's atmosphere around May 10th after being stuck in orbit since 1972; some parts may survive.\\nCONTEXT: Debris poses minimal risk, but highlights space junk concerns.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 53832, 'sourceId': 12799, 'url': 'https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/hot-chili-strengthens-team-to-push-chile-projects-into-development-20250507-p5lxeq.html?ref=rss', 'title': 'Hot Chili strengthens team to push Chile projects into development', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T07:15:50.000Z', 'content': \"SponsoredBusinessCompaniesBulls N' BearsBrought to you by BULLS N’ BEARSBy Andrew ToddMay 7, 2025 — 5.15pmHot Chili has secured the services of two seasoned mining executives to bolster leadership as the company progresses its Costa Fuego copper-gold project and Huasco Water venture in Chile’s Atacama region.Ex-Gold Fields Australia executive Stuart Mathews joins as non-executive chairman, while Chilean copper expert Alberto Cerda assumes the role of project director. Cerda brings a particular set of skills… namely in mine development and operations to support the company’s upcoming definitive feasibility studies for both projects.Hot Chili has appointed mining executive Stuart Mathews as non-executive chairman to progress its Chilean projects into development.The appointments align with Hot Chili’s strategic focus on advancing its low-altitude, copper and water projects amid a looming copper market, which has international majors clamouring for quality.Hot Chili says Mathews’ and Cerda’s proven expertise in delivering large-scale mining operations - particularly in Chile in Cerda’s case - positions the company to navigate the complexities of project development, resource optimisation and strategic partnerships in the world’s top copper producing country.Costa Fuego is a large copper-gold porphyry set to churn out 116,000 tonnes per annum of copper-equivalent metal, which includes 95,000t of copper and 48,000 ounces of gold in its first 14 years. Importantly for Hot Chili’s metals mix, chairman Mathews comes from a gold mining background as the recent executive vice president for Gold Fields in Australasia, where he oversaw operations producing more than 1 million ounces of gold annually.Cerda takes care of the copper background as a Chilean mining engineer with more than 40 years of experience in major copper projects in Chile for companies such as Newmont, Barrick and BHP Billiton.Hot Chili’s projects are strategically positioned to benefit from rising copper demand and regional infrastructure needs. Costa Fuego’s robust economics and Huasco Water’s exclusive water supply permit make it strategically significant to the region.With environmental permitting and exploration ongoing, the company is well-placed to deliver and further extend its overall resource numbers, thanks to a recent discovery of copper-gold porphyry mineralisation at its non-contiguous but nearby La Verde project.Located 60 kilometres from Las Losas port on Chile’s coastal range, Costa Fuego is Hot Chili’s flagship project. A recent prefeasibility study outlined a 20-year mine life with a maiden ore reserve of 502Mt grading 0.37 per cent copper, 0.10 grams per tonne (g/t) gold, 0.49g/t silver, and 97 parts per million (ppm) molybdenum, with a contained 1.86Mt copper, 1.58M ounces gold, 7.95M ounces silver and 49,000t molybdenum.The project is expected to generate a post-tax net present value (NPV) of US$1.2 billion at a US$4.30 a pound copper price and US$2280 per ounce gold price. At current market prices, the NPV increases to US$2.2B, with a 19 per cent internal rate of return and a five-year payback on US$1.27B capital expenditure.Hot Chili’s 80 per cent-owned Huasco Water project, in partnership with Compañia Minera del Pacifico, addresses critical water scarcity in the Huasco Valley.Secured after a decade-long regulatory process, Huasco Water holds the region’s only maritime licence for seawater supply, providing the project with a significant competitive advantage. Its recent pre-feasibility study detailed a two-stage development plan to supply water to local major copper producers, to earn an estimated revenue of US$9.35B and a US$977M NPV over 22 years of supply.The company has completed its baseline environmental studies and a second maritime concession application is under review, positioning Huasco Water, like Costa Fuego copper, to commence supply by the end of the decade.With copper prices soaring and gold continuing at all-time highs, the appointments come at pivotal time in the company’s development. Hot Chili says it remains on a tidy $7.5M cash pile to rapidly expand its resources, while simultaneously courting strategic partners for production at its huge copper and water undertakings.Is your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

Mr Smith, an 81-year-old entrepreneur, said last month\\'s blackout in Spain and Portugal, during Australia\\'s election campaign, demonstrated the flaws of being too reliant on renewable energy (pictured are children in Barcelona eating by candlelight) \\'It\\'s going to be really interesting when we start getting announcements from the Labor Party that they\\'re going to extend coal and then we get announcements from the Labor Party that they\\'ll put more gas turbines in.\\'Mr Smith predicted a future federal government in 2040 would have to embrace nuclear power, predicting small modular reactors would be part of the mix, despite not yet existing, so Australia could meet its net zero by 2050 target.Instead of coal and gas, nuclear power would be the alternative using the process of fission - splitting atoms - to heat water to create steam, which powers a turbine that creates electricity.This would see Australia join 32 other nations that have nuclear reactors, as the likes of billionaire Bill Gates developed cutting-edge nuclear technology.\\'It will be maybe 2040 - it will be a long time away; the whole country by then will support it because what will happen is we\\'ll find that we\\'re not going to get to zero carbon by 2050,\\' Mr Smith said.\\xa0\\'By then, it will probably be something completely new - by 2040, I would imagine it will be something quite new; I would imagine small modular reactors will be available by then.\\xa0\\'It will take another five to 10 years of extending coal and gas before we do it.\\'I can see us getting there but it\\'s another 15 to 20 years away - it will be new politicians in 10 or 15 years\\' time and they\\'ll just be the reality of it.\\'\\xa0 Opposition Leader Peter Dutton resoundingly lost the election , and his own seat, with a plan to build seven government-run nuclear reactors in every mainland state to meet a net zero by 2050 target for eliminating carbon emissions With\\xa0battery storage technology unlikely to improve, he predicted a future federal government in 2040 would have to embrace nuclear power, predicting small modular reactors would be part of the mix, despite not yet existing, so Australia could meet its net zero by 2050 target COALITION\\'S PLANNED NUCLEAR REACTORS Callide power station, central QueenslandTarong power station, Queensland\\'s Burnett regionLiddell power station, New South Wales Hunter ValleyMount Piper power station, New South Wales central west\\xa0Loy Yang power station, Victoria\\'s Gippsland\\xa0Northern power station, South Australia\\'s Port Augusta regionMuja power station, Western Australia\\'s South West region\\xa0 Mr Smith said state governments would be convinced of the need for nuclear power \\'because there is simply no alternative\\' - leading to them lifting bans.\\'We will have blackouts - you can\\'t run a country on intermittent solar and wind;

So Americans shouldn't be rushing to 'chug olive oil like it is water.'Campbell added on LinkedIn: 'I get so angry with influencers telling me all seed oils will kill me and to chug olive oil like it is water for health.\\xa0They do not realize the nuanced nature of nutrition and how it is personalized to individual health.'\\xa0\\xa0Additionally, others warn people could be overdoing it on the olive oil craze and because the oil is so calorically dense, it could actually lead to weight gain and all the associated negative health consequences. Olive oil is just one component of the Mediterranean diet, not a main ingredient to be guzzled, dietitians told DailyMail.com Singer Dua Lipa has helped popularize olive oil as a dessert ingredient by drizzling it on vanilla ice cream New York dietitian Michelle Routhenstein told DailyMail.com she had a client who was drinking one cup of the oil per day, while seriously struggling to lose weight.\\xa0Routhenstein said: 'This extreme behavior not only hindered his weight loss efforts but also adversely affected his cholesterol levels, as such high volumes of olive oil can be high in saturated fat, counteracting its purported benefits.'Estimates vary, but by one analysis the global olive oil market was valued at around $14.2billion in 2022, and it is growing by about 3.33 percent per year. This estimate projects the global olive oil market's value will reach $18.42billion by 2030.\\xa0The consensus among experts is that cooking with a splash of olive oil is safe and indeed the preferred cooking oil of many professional chefs and dietitians alike.And while the oil has high levels of healthy unsaturated fats, Campbell said the health of oils also depends on\\xa0their ratio of omega-3s (fats crucial for heart, brain and eye health) and omega-6s (fats that play a role in brain function and heart health), as well as the temperature you cook them at.All oils have different smoke points, the temperature at which the oils burn, start decomposing and producing harmful byproducts.\\xa0Olive oil's smoke point is lower than many seed oil alternatives - about 325 degrees Fahrenheit (165 degrees Celsius), meaning there is a higher risk of burning the oil, having it break down and releasing free radicals and a substance called acrolein, the chemical that gives burnt foods their pungent flavor and harsh aroma.Seed oils, however, have higher smoke points, including avocado oil at 375 F (190 C), sunflower oil at 440 degrees F (225 C), soybean oil at 450 degrees F (230 C) and safflower oil has the highest at 510 F (265 C).\\xa0 Consuming more than half a tablespoon of olive oil a day led to a 19-percent lower risk of cardiovascular death compared to those who consumed about one teaspoon or less per day.

USDA is among the agencies that twice invited employees to quit their jobs through the deferred resignation program — once in late January when the deal was presented to nearly the entire federal workforce, and again for a short window in April. The Trump administration has leaned heavily on the deferred resignation program as it seeks to dramatically downsize the federal workforce.\\nBut the need to fill positions so soon after letting people go has raised questions, including from Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee. \"So you let people go and you\\'re looking for new people to fill the positions that they had experience in?\" Murray asked.\\n\"We\\'re having those discussions right now,\" Rollins responded, while noting that 15,000 employees represents less than 15% of USDA\\'s workforce and that the department loses 8,000 to 10,000 employees every year through attrition. Still, Rollins invited some of those who took the deferred resignation offer to return. \"If they want to come back, and if they were in a key position, then we would love to have that conversation,\" she told lawmakers. Earlier, NPR reported that just a day after employees of USDA\\'s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) had left their jobs through the deferred resignation program, human resources sent an email to remaining employees offering them an opportunity to apply for 73 open positions, including ones newly vacant. One employee who had taken the deferred resignation deal was furious to learn their job was on that list. They had not wanted to resign from their job but felt forced to do so after repeated warnings of mass layoffs ahead. The employee asked to remain anonymous out of fear of reprisal for speaking with the media while still on paid administrative leave.\\nAt Tuesday\\'s hearing, Rollins acknowledged some mistakes may have been made along the way but insisted that people in key positions were not accepted in the second round of the deferred resignation program. \"We are very intentionally approaching this. Have we done it perfectly? No. Any type of wholescale change and big effort to basically realign an entire government agency is difficult,\" she said. \"We\\'re working every day to solve for a lot of this, and I think we\\'re making a lot of really good progress.\" On Wednesday, Rollins went further, denying that anyone at APHIS had been allowed to accept deferred resignation, or DRP, in April.\\n\"In the last round, we did not accept any DRPs from anyone in [Farm Service Agency] offices or APHIS offices or state veterinarians,\" Rollins said at a budget hearing of the House Appropriations Committee. Her assertion is at odds with another account from an APHIS employee whose separation agreement was seen by NPR. NPR agreed not to name this employee because he also fears retaliation for speaking with the media while on paid administrative leave. He described seeing stressed IT staff dealing with piles of laptops and cell phones turned in by those departing the government last Wednesday. He added his to the pile. Armando Rosario-Lebron, a vice president with the National Association of Agriculture Employees, which represents employees in APHIS\\' Plant Protection and Quarantine program, believes several hundred of its bargaining unit members could have\\xa0accepted the deferred resignation offer in April.

The EV charger program was set to allocate $5 billion over five years to various states, of which an estimated $3.3 billion had already been made available.The lawsuit is led by attorneys general from California, Colorado and Washington, and challenges the Federal Highway Administration\\'s authority to halt the funding. They argue Congress, which approved the money in 2021 as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, holds that authority.\"These funds were going to be used to shape the future of transportation,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said, calling it “short-sighted” of Trump to revoke the funds.“We won’t sit back while the Trump administration violates the law,” Bonta, a Democrat, said. The U.S. Department of Transportation did not respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.EVs stood at about 8% of new car sales in the U.S. last year, according to Motorintelligence.com, a sign the market is growing — although the pace has slowed as the auto industry tries to convince mainstream buyers about going electric. The program was meant to assuage some concerns and build infrastructure along highway corridors first, then address gaps elsewhere once the state highway obligations were met.Some states with projects running under the program have already been reimbursed by the Biden-era federal funds. Others are still contracting for their sites. Still more had halted their plans by the time the Trump administration ordered states to stop their spending. Regardless, getting these chargers installed and operating has been a slow process with contracting challenges, permitting delays and complex electrical upgrades.It was expected that states would fight against the federal government’s efforts to slow the nation’s electric vehicle charger buildout. New York, for example, which is part of the suit, has been awarded over $175 million in federal funds from the program, and state officials say $120 million is currently being withheld by the Trump administration.Even the electric carmaker Tesla, run by Elon Musk, who has spearheaded Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency efforts to cut federal spending, benefited greatly from funding under the program, receiving millions of dollars to expand its already-massive footprint of chargers in the U.S. Despite threats to the program, experts have said they expect the nation’s EV charging buildout to continue as automakers look to make good on massive electrification ambitions. Consumers thinking about buying an EV often cite concerns about the availability of charging infrastructure. It\\'s a hurdle for people living in multifamily dwellings and in rural areas, or what are otherwise known as “charging deserts.” It\\'s also a problem for people who can\\'t find a place to charge their vehicle near their work, or who often drive longer highway routes.Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said withholding the funds was illegal and would kill thousands of U.S. jobs, ceding them to China.\"Instead of hawking Teslas on the White House lawn, President Trump could actually help Elon — and the nation — by following the law and releasing this bipartisan funding,” Newsom said, referencing Trump\\'s recent purchase of a Tesla in a show of support for Musk.The Trump administration’s effort to withdraw funding for electric vehicle chargers is part of a broader push to roll back environmental policies advanced under Biden. During Trump’s first week back in office, he signed executive orders to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement again, reverse a 2030 target for electric vehicles to make up half of new cars sold, and end environmental justice efforts. At the same time, federal agencies under Trump have rolled back key rules and regulations and supported the build-out of the fossil fuel industry.The U.S. House also advanced proposals last week aimed at blocking California from enforcing vehicle-emission rules, including a ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. The Senate parliamentarian says the California policies are not subject to the review mechanism used by the House.___St. John reported from Detroit.___Austin is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

On Wednesday he explained why.“I just feel like the next step, reconnecting with the European game and coaching in Europe, is something that I would like to do,” said Cherundolo, who is returning to Germany, where he starred as a player. “The timing of it and the messaging, I think the sooner the better so we can all kind of plan and move forward and get it out of the way and focus on this season’s goals.“I’m not a great fan of leaving things to the last minute.”Cherundolo, 46, spent his entire 16-year club career in Germany at Hannover, where he met his wife, started a family and still owns a house. That’s also where he started coaching. The decision to go back was a family one, he said, as was the decision to come to the U.S. four years ago.“I don’t think there’s anything negative about it for me. It’s all opportunity and positive about the next chapter,” said Cherundolo, who grew up in San Diego. “That’s how we saw moving back to Los Angeles: We saw a great opportunity and as a family, more of an adventure.“And now we see something similar moving back to Europe.”Cherundolo said he intends to continue coaching but said he hasn’t lined up anything for next season, preferring instead to focus on the remainder of this season.“It’s really hard to plan seven months in advance in coaching,” he said. “Not many clubs are willing to wait that long for a particular coach unless your name is Pep Guardiola or Jurgen Klopp. And last time I checked my passport, that’s not my name.“So no, there’s nothing immediately around the corner and I actually kind of like that. I’m excited about what project would be next.”Cherundolo got his managerial start in Hannover’s academy system, then coached LAFC’s affiliate in the second-division USL Championship — going 6-23-3 — in 2021 before taking over for Bob Bradley in MLS a year later. And in three-plus seasons, he established himself as one of the most successful coaches in league history.As a rookie manager, he became the only man to win both the Supporter’s Shield and MLS Cup in his first season. He also won the 2024 U.S. Open Cup and took LAFC to the title game of the 2023 CONCACAF Champions League, 2023 MLS Cup and 2024 Leagues Cup.His 59 regular-season wins since 2022 are the most of any MLS coach over that span; he has gone 88-43-28 and played in six finals in all competitions. And he has done that with a revolving door at the entrance to his team’s locker room since just two players, defenders Ryan Hollingshead and Eddie Segura, remain from the roster he inherited in 2022.His final season is shaping up as his most challenging, and not because the announcement of his impending departure last month makes him a lame-duck coach. At 5-4-2, LAFC is already nine points back in the Supporter’s Shield race yet they can play their way into the prestigious FIFA Club World Cup with a victory over Mexico’s Club América later this month.Cherundolo said the decision to return to Germany was made “a couple of months ago” but he didn’t share it publicly until the team was eliminated from the CONCACAF Champions Cup on April 9. The announcement came eight days later.“No hidden agenda or other reason,” he said of the timing. “It was really just to maintain focus.”Doing that, he said, will be easier now that his short-term future is set.“There’s nothing to hold back,” he said. “It makes it easier to push even harder to end on the most positive note possible. What other people think about it, I’m not in control of nor do I spend any time wasting energy on that. That’s not my issue. The team is my issue.“Everybody is locked in and focused on being as successful as possible.”Cherundolo also said the move back to Germany doesn’t mean he has to stay there. His name has come up in conversations about the U.S. national team job, which will come open after next year’s World Cup, and there will certainly be opportunities to return to MLS someday, so he’s not closing any doors.“No, no,” he said. “All options on the table.”', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: LAFC's Cherundolo leaving to coach in Europe\\nENTITIES: Steve Cherundolo, LAFC, Germany, Hannover, MLS, Pep Guardiola, Jurgen Klopp\\nEVENT: Steve Cherundolo, LAFC's coach, announced his departure at the end of the season to return to Germany for coaching opportunities in Europe after a successful run with LAFC.\\nCONTEXT: Cherundolo's move aims to reconnect with European soccer and coaching opportunities.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 46996, 'sourceId': 888, 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/world/europe/papal-conclave-st-peters-square-smoke.html', 'title': 'Waiting for the Smoke That Heralds a New Pope', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T21:45:49.000Z', 'content': 'AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTYou have a preview view of this article while we are checking your access.

By smoke.The highly secret voting began inside what is possibly one of the world’s most secure vaults in the early evening, with the 133 cardinals tasked with deciding who will succeed Pope Francis writing candidates’ names on voting cards by hand, trying to disguise their handwriting.Outside in St. Peter’s Square, thousands of the faithful, the curious and the vacationing gathered to await the news of whether the cardinals had managed to elect a papal successor. Word came at 9 p.m., in the form of black smoke billowing from a chimney installed last week on the roof of the chapel.If the smoke had been white, it would have meant that the cardinals had chosen the first new pope in a dozen years in just one round of voting, a feat not seen for centuries.But the black smoke, created when the cardinals’ ballots are incinerated in a cast-iron stove, means they’ll have to try again.“We are cold, we’re hungry, we’re thirsty but yet we can’t move,” said the Rev. Peter Mangum, 61, a priest at the Church of Jesus the Good Shepherd in Monroe, La. He and three other priests had been in the square for about seven hours, and it was Father Mangum’s fourth time waiting for news of a new pope.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

If he drives into his chest in a tackling motion, then that will actually be prior opportunity. But with Brayden bracing with the bump-type style, our umpires will err towards high contact and pay the free kick for that.”Lyon: “Did he (Mannagh) not lower his head and run into Brayden Maynard? Won’t every player do that now?”Razor: “Maynard, he bumps him.”Lyon: “If he (Mannagh) didn’t put his head down, it wouldn’t be an issue.”Razor: “And if he tried to tackle him and not bump him, it wouldn’t be, either.”Lyon: “Aren’t you allowed to shape to bump on the assumption that you’re upright? And then you (Mannagh) are the one that lowers your head.”Razor: “Maynard needs to attempt to tackle and not attempt to bump, and in that instance there, Garry, you get that (split-second) time ... if Maynard braces himself and is stationary and it’s a tackling motion, he’s more likely not to be penalised. That’s all I’m saying.”Lyon: “We are told if you elect to bump you can do so legally. If you hit someone in the head, then you’ll come under scrutiny. In that instance, surely Shaun Mannagh is responsible for the hit to the head.”Razor: “I would suggest to you that there’s a level of responsibility by both parties. I would say to you that Mannagh is winning the football, and the umpire has to determine ‘does he lower his head in an attempt to obtain possession’, or ...”Lyon: “He’s got the football, and he ducks his head.”Razor: “Did he lower? Does it make any difference whether he ducks his head or not? Does his head go down further or not? It’s marginal. So, the umpire is going to err on paying a free kick for high contact because they want to protect him.”Insane final moment of all-time thriller | 01:45SCHULTZ SCORE REVIEWRazor: “The sole judge of a score is the goal umpire. In these circumstances, the boundary umpires, who will both be on the posts, they will stay there unless they’ve got something definitive that they can provide. “So, our boundary umpire ... comes in, and that’s to indicate ‘I’ve got something I can add’ ... you’ll see that the boundary umpire signals ‘I saw the ball touched’, so we go to review, we’ve got a decision. “They’ve made a decision on-field of touched, and now the ARC, with this vision, they have to go to work and either go ‘we’ve got insufficient evidence to overrule it’, or otherwise.”Gerard Whateley: “What if the goal umpire thinks it wasn’t touched, but the boundary umpire is coming in (indicating it was)?”Razor: “The goal umpire is the sole judge of the score, and so if he’s adamant that it isn’t touched, he wouldn’t have pressed his hip to talk — he’d have made his decision on field.”Pies 'winners' despite 'stiff' ump calls | 07:25HILL TACKLE ON MANNAGHRazor: “At home I go ‘ball’, right, as I’m watching at home with my fan hat on. And then as I watch the replay, what’s really important here is that the entirety of the tackle must be a legal tackle for the umpire to award holding the ball. “And right at the end there, you can see that the arm slipped down around the legs and is below the knee. The right arm. So, by virtue of that, I can absolutely understand how trip has been paid. “This is one that sits in the margins, and I can totally understand the decision from the umpire.”Lyon: “I’m not going to argue that ... that’s OK, I get that, but the consistency is what people want.”Chamberlain then cited a similar incident — James Sicily tackling Maurice Rioli last Sunday — in which the incorrect call of holding the ball was made. Razor: “We saw another one in another game on the weekend ... in this example, you can see that it starts above the hips but ends up below the knees. We pay holding the ball. That’s an incorrect decision. In this instance, we need to pay a trip as well.”Invasive! Gerard calls out ump proximity | 01:20CRISP-UMPIRE MOMENT BEFORE AFTER-SIREN KICKWhateley: “I don’t think the umpire should be in Jack Crisp’s face like this. So, he’s taken the mark, the final siren has sounded — that’s invasive, I reckon. I get what’s going on, and the game management, but that is too in-his-face in the moment of maximum consequence. So, I thought the best one I can think of is Dan Houston (in Port Adelaide vs. Essendon in Round 16, 2023) almost the same shot, no umpire in his face and in his space ... just give the guy, he’s trying to win the game here, don’t be in his face like that.”Razor: “I can understand that. There’s two parts to this. The umpire (in 2023), his role there is on the mark, so he’s adjacent to the mark. The umpire you’re referencing (in Cats-Pies) is in the protected area, so he’s instructed to get behind the kicker so he can get a line of sight on the kick. I don’t know whether Jack Crisp asked him anything or not, I don’t know that, so maybe he did ... I don’t know. I totally understand your position, though.”Whateley: “Don’t be right there, he’s about to win the game.”Razor: “Absolutely, but again, as I said, they’re in different roles and did Jack Crisp engage in the conversation? I don’t know.”\", 'location': 'N/A', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: AFL umpire reviews controversial calls in Geelong-Collingwood\\nENTITIES: Ray Chamberlain, Garry Lyon, Brayden Maynard, Shaun Mannagh, Lachie Schultz, Jack Crisp, Gerard Whateley, Bobby Hill, James Sicily, Maurice Rioli\\nEVENT: Former AFL umpire Ray Chamberlain reviews contentious umpiring decisions from the Geelong-Collingwood game, including a high tackle, score review, holding the ball call, and umpire proximity after the siren.\\nCONTEXT: Analysis of controversial umpiring decisions in Geelong-Collingwood AFL game.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 47270, 'sourceId': 896, 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/weather/southern-us-storms-rain.html', 'title': 'Storms Bring More Rain to New Orleans and Across the South', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T21:28:35.000Z', 'content': 'AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSlow-Moving Storms Bring More Rain to Saturated Southern CitiesNew Orleans and other areas along the Gulf Coast have had a lot of rain this spring. They’re seeing more this week.\\nForecast risk of excessive rain for Wednesday\\nMay 7, 2025A sluggish line of storms continues to deliver repeated rounds of heavy rainfall across the already saturated ground of the Southeast this week, renewing flash flood risks. In New Orleans, where late last month storms dropped a month’s worth of rain in a day, weary forecasters at the local office of the National Weather Service warned that the area’s “tolerance for another round of heavy rain is fairly low.”Across the region on Wednesday, rainfall totals by late afternoon ranged from between one and three inches in most of Southern Louisiana. Metairie, just outside New Orleans, was an outlier, receiving 4.56 inches, according to the National Weather Service in New Orleans.The Weather Prediction Center placed a broad zone from southeastern Texas to southwestern Alabama under an elevated risk for flash flooding, and a slightly higher risk warning was in effect across southern Louisiana and Mississippi. The day’s highest warning was in place across southeast Louisiana, including New Orleans.“There will still be some showers and thunderstorms throughout the afternoon and into tonight,” Peter Mullinax, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center, said. “But the heaviest action is going on this morning.”A flood watch remained in effect in New Orleans through Thursday, according to the National Weather Service. There were only a few reports of minor flooding on Wednesday afternoon in the city.The repeated downpours are the result of storms breaking out along a nearly stationary front, sitting just north of the Gulf Coast. Warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico is building up along this front, and a weather system approaching from the west is injecting additional energy into the atmosphere. As a result, the storms are dropping large amounts of rain in a short amount of time to the same areas.The slow-moving storms have already been affecting the region since early in the week, delivering significant rainfall and flooding across parts of Texas and Louisiana. On Monday and Tuesday, areas in Louisiana received two to four inches of rain, with some locations in the west surpassing eight inches over the 48-hour period.In Texas, some areas have already exceeded their average monthly rainfall for May in just the first week. In Amarillo, 2.46 inches of rain was recorded by Wednesday morning, far surpassing the city’s May average of 2.27 inches.VideoHeavy rain, storms and flash flooding are expected across Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi this week.CreditCredit...Daniel Cole/Reuters“It’s been quite wet for a good chunk of the start,” Mr. Mullinax said. “Some of this is welcomed, especially as we get closer to summer, but to have it be that kind of levels, of course it’s going to cause some flooding problems, and unfortunately that’s been the case the last couple of days, especially in northern and eastern Texas.”In Brenham, Texas, between Austin and Houston, a search operation recovered the body of Devah Woods, 10, on Tuesday. She had last been seen on Monday as storms moved through the area.“The response from everyone was overwhelming,” Atwood Kenjura, the mayor of Brenham, said during a news conference, expressing gratitude to rescue workers. The Brenham Fire Department reported that the search effort had included drones, swift water rescue teams and canine units.Severe weather was an added threat in the Southeast through Thursday, especially across portions of Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. The Storm Prediction Center warned of hail and damaging winds as the primary threats, along with a low risk of tornadoes. Southeastern Texas, including cities such as Victoria and Missouri City, were under slightly higher risk of severe weather, especially Wednesday afternoon and evening.The Southeast will continue to face severe weather and high rainfall in the coming days. The Weather Prediction Center warned of flash flood risks for parts of Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida and, later this week, South Carolina. Southeast Louisiana into southwest Alabama, including New Orleans and Mobile, remain under a slightly higher risk.“We’ve got rainfall in the forecast all the next seven days,” Mr. Mullinax said. “It’s just a tough stretch of unsettled weather in the Southeast for the next week.”There were sporadic power outages in the region. About 16,000 households in Louisiana, 8,000 in Mississippi, and 6,000 in Texas had no power, as of early Wednesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.Adeel Hassan contributed reporting.Nazaneen Ghaffar is a Times reporter on the Weather team.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Storms Bring More Rain to Southern States\\nENTITIES: New Orleans, Gulf Coast, National Weather Service, Weather Prediction Center, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina\\nEVENT: Slow-moving storms are bringing repeated rounds of heavy rainfall across the already saturated ground of the Southeast, renewing flash flood risks, with some areas already exceeding their average monthly rainfall for May.\\nCONTEXT: The slow-moving storms have already been affecting the region since early in the week, delivering significant rainfall and flooding across parts of Texas and Louisiana.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 49489, 'sourceId': 12506, 'url': 'https://www.techradar.com/audio/earbuds-airpods/anker-announces-new-cheap-wireless-earbuds-with-premium-audio-features', 'title': 'Anker announces new cheap wireless earbuds with premium audio features', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T18:21:26.000Z', 'content': \"(Image credit: Anker)\\nAnker announces Soundcore Liberty 5 wireless earbudsThey launched today: May 7, 2025They cost $129.99 / £99.99 / AU$169.99 but boast premium featuresAnker has just launched a brand new pair of affordable wireless earbuds: the Anker Soundcore Liberty 5, and just like their predecessors they look like a cheap way to access premium features.The Liberty 5 buds boast some useful features including active noise cancellation, an 12-hour battery life with active noise-cancellation (ANC), which can be extended up to 32 more hours with their charging case.The new buds also offer improved bass performance thanks to dual bass-enhancing tubes that amplify the low frequencies resonance while increasing air flow, which according to Anker leads to more powerful, yet balanced, bass reproduction.What’s more if you’re using an Android device you can access higher quality audio transmission via LDAC – so you should find your audio sounds more complete than it does on non-LDAC earbuds.If you like the sound of these new earbuds they’re available to buy right now on Amazon.com, Soundcore.com, and from select retailers for $129.99 / £99.99 / AU$169.99.(Image credit: Anker)This means the buds aren’t quite as affordable as other recent cheap wireless earbuds like Panasonic’s new RB-F10 over-ear headphones, but with a premium suite of features a higher price is to be expected.We haven’t been able to test these earbuds yet, but previous Anker audio products scored well; we gave the Anker Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro three-and-a-half stars, and the older Anker Soundcore Liberty Air buds earned four stars – though both could have been better.Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.The more recent Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 buds (which we haven’t tested) appeared to score well with reviewers, though you may find you’ll want to wait and see how well the latest Anker Soundcore Liberty 5 buds fare before you buy them – or maybe wait for a discount to make their $129.99 / £99.99 / AU$169.99 asking price is even more affordable.Yopu might also likeNeed cheap earbuds right now?

We want our players to feel excited when they log on to discover their teammates already hanging out online. We want our players to recognize familiar names and to make myths and memes out of each other. We want our players to love remembering that one time where they pulled off That Play that changed the whole story of the match.”TeamLFG’s first project will be a “team-based action game that draws inspiration from fighting games, platformers, MOBAs, life sims, and frog-type games.” The studio said its still-untitled, what-exactly-is-a-frog-type-game-anyway game will be set in a “lighthearted, comedic world set in brand-new, mythic, science-fantasy universe.” Platforms and release date were not announced.Bungie first teased TeamLFG’s project in the summer of 2023, when it ramped up hiring for a project that would require “team members with diverse backgrounds.” Bungie said at the time that the incubation team was “designing for depth, mastery, and Bungie’s signature action feel, as well as a friendly, inclusive community.”TeamLFG’s mission statement to make “immersive multiplayer worlds propelled by action games that players can learn, play, and master for countless hours” sounds in line with Bungie’s goals with Destiny 2 and the rebooted Marathon. But the new studio’s untitled live-service project sounds quite different in tone and target audience.Sony Interactive Entertainment acquired Bungie in 2022 as part of a $3.6 billion deal. The studio has remained multiplatform, and was intended to stay independent from SIE. But in the ensuing years, Bungie delayed projects and laid off hundreds of employees — and in 2024, Bungie announced it was “deepening our integration with Sony Interactive Entertainment” and moving 155 employees to SIE. That also meant spinning out the incubation project and team that would ultimately become TeamLFG.Bungie is still plugging away at Destiny 2 — the studio announced two new expansions coming to the game on Tuesday — and working on extraction shooter Marathon for a September release.', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: PlayStation forms TeamLFG studio from Bungie incubation\\nENTITIES: PlayStation Studios, TeamLFG, Bungie, Sony Interactive Entertainment, Hermen Hulst\\nEVENT: PlayStation Studios has formed TeamLFG, a new internal studio spun out from Bungie, to develop a team-based action game set in a comedic, science-fantasy universe.\\nCONTEXT: TeamLFG's focus on community and unique game inspirations sets it apart.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 47226, 'sourceId': 895, 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/science/covid-coronavirus-bats-genetics.html', 'title': 'Genetic Study Retraces Covid’s Origins in Bats', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T17:46:48.000Z', 'content': 'AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTYou have a preview view of this article while we are checking your access.

Some of those animals were sold in markets, where the coronavirus jumped again, into humans. The result was the SARS pandemic, which spread to 33 countries and claimed 774 lives. A few months into it, scientists discovered the coronavirus in mammals known as palm civets sold in a market at the center of the outbreak.In a study published on Wednesday, a team of researchers compared the evolutionary story of SARS with that of Covid 17 years later. The researchers analyzed the genomes of the two coronaviruses that caused the pandemics, along with 248 related coronaviruses in bats and other mammals.Jonathan Pekar, an evolutionary virologist at the University of Edinburgh and an author of the new study, said that the histories of the two coronaviruses followed parallel paths. “In my mind, they are extraordinarily similar,” he said.In both cases, Dr. Pekar and his colleagues argue, a coronavirus jumped from bats to wild mammals in southwestern China. In a short period of time, wildlife traders took the infected animals hundreds of miles to city markets, and the virus wreaked havoc in humans.“When you sell wildlife in the heart of cities, you’re going to have a pandemic every so often,” said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona and an author of the new study.The study lands at a fraught political moment. Last month the White House created a web page called “Lab Leak: The True Origin of Covid 19,” asserting that the pandemic had been caused not by a market spillover but by an accident in a lab in Wuhan, China.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Now, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 ascends with artistic force, captivating listeners beyond gaming and proving that music born in pixels can echo far beyond the screen.\\nRecommended Videos\\nA glance at the Billboard Classical Albums chart reveals Expedition 33 proudly at number one, and rightfully so. Beyond its gripping story and fun-filled turn-based RPG mechanics, the soundtrack stands out as unforgettable. The main menu alone drew in so many players, myself included, with its captivating tone. I’ve found myself humming its theme all week, immersed in the haunting vocals and the delicate arrangement of strings. Screenshot via Billboard What makes this triumph even more impressive is the serendipitous journey of Lorien Testard, the composer behind Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. His path to the project began in the most unexpected way—by sharing his SoundCloud compositions on a video game forum. There, Guillaume Broche, Game Director of Sandfall Interactive, discovered Testard’s work, setting the stage for a fortuitous collaboration that would define the soundtrack of Expedition 33. It just goes to show how anything can happen in the video game industry, even if it starts off as a simple conversation on a forum. Testard’s journey through the world of video games has profoundly influenced his approach to composing. On the official Expedition 33 page, he mentions that The Legend of Zelda features one of the most “unforgettable soundtracks.” I can certainly see the inspiration behind this in Expedition 33, where echoes of that iconic score can be felt in the sweeping melodies and richly layered orchestration. But, of course, Testard adds his own unique spin to the world of music, and I reckon his work may inspire other virtuosos in future projects. Considering that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has claimed the number one spot on Billboard’s Classical Albums, it’s certainly a strong contender for Best Score and Music at the Game Awards.

The average yearly cost of asylum accommodation is now expected to be higher than the amount ministers hope to save from cutting the winter fuel payment.The NAO report, which was commissioned by Parliament\\'s Home Affairs Select Committee, says the number of asylum seekers in paid-for accommodation increased from around 47,000 in December 2019 to 110,000 in December 2024.Three quarters of all the money spent on asylum accommodation currently goes on hotels, despite them only accounting for around a third of all the asylum seekers being housed.The NAO says that private providers who sign deals with the government may profit more from hotels than other types of accommodation.In 2019, Conservative ministers signed seven regional contracts with three companies - Serco, Mears and Clearsprings - to help house asylum seekers.The NAO says the three companies made a combined profit of £383m on asylum accommodation contracts between September 2019 and August 2024.A large part of the extra costs is accounted for by Clearsprings\\' contract in the south of England, which has risen from £0.7bn to an expected £7bn.Clearsprings\\' founder and director, Graham King, has previously donated to the Conservative Party, through other companies he has owned.Home Office figures released in February showed the number of people claiming asylum in the UK had reached its highest level since records began in 1979.A Home Office spokesperson said the Labour government \"inherited an asylum system in chaos\" and criticised the Conservatives for signing \"disastrous contracts that were wasting millions in taxpayer money\".They said there were now fewer asylum hotels open than since the election and that measures taken were \"forecast to save the taxpayer £4bn by the end of 2026\".The Home Office has an optional break clause next year in the contracts with the three companies, but it\\'s understood these will not be triggered.A senior Home Office source said the main driving force behind the rising accommodation costs was the increase in people crossing the channel on small boats.They said the border has \"slowly but surely been handed over to people smuggling gangs\", which meant the Conservative government had to quickly sign contracts that were \"not in any state fit\".The source said that ministers were in contact with Serco, Mears and Clearsprings \"very regularly\" and that the Labour government wants to \"hold their feet to the fire\".They refused to speculate on whether any of the three companies would likely be involved in asylum accommodation contracts after 2029.The chief executive of the Refugee Council told the BBC that \"hotel owners have had a big payday\" and it was \"clear there have been particularly significant profits made in the south east due to the number of hotels and the higher cost of housing in the region\".Enver Solomon praised the government for \"processing claims again\" but called on ministers to move away from the current system and instead \"work in close partnership with local authorities\" to house asylum seekers.Decisions taken by Boris Johnson\\'s government to stop processing many asylum claims are seen as a major driving force behind the initial increase in asylum seekers needing to be housed.Rishi Sunak\\'s government began to process more of those asylum cases, but his claim to have cleared the backlog was rebuked by the UK\\'s statistics watchdog last year.The number of hotels in use dropped sharply during Sunak\\'s time as prime minister and has remained similar since Labour came to power last July.In November, Home Office minister Angela Eagle admitted that more hotels were being used in some parts of the country, but the government insists the overall number has dropped slightly since the general election.Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp claimed the use of asylum hotels had \"soared\" on Labour\\'s watch.Reform UK has said it will explore all options - including legal challenges - to prevent the use of hotels in council areas it now controls.

The heart of the dispute is the two companies’ estimated $US20 billion ($31 billion)-a-year deal that makes Google the default offering for queries in Apple’s browser. The case could force the tech giants to unwind the pact, upending how the iPhone and other devices have long operated.Apple says it is “actively looking at” revamping the Safari web browser on its devices to focus on AI-powered search engines.Credit: BloombergBeyond that upheaval, AI is already making gains with consumers. Cue noted that searches on Safari dipped for the first time last month, which he attributed to people using AI. Cue said he believes that AI search providers, including OpenAI, Perplexity AI and Anthropic, will eventually replace standard search engines like Alphabet’s Google. He said he believes Apple will bring those options to Safari in the future.“We will add them to the list — they probably won’t be the default,” he said, indicating that they still need to improve. Cue specifically said the company has had some discussions with Perplexity.“Prior to AI, my feeling around this was, none of the others were valid choices,” Cue said. “I think today there is much greater potential because there are new entrants attacking the problem in a different way.”The looming shift is a giant one for the iconic iPhone and a company with more than 2 billion active devices. Since Apple’s original smartphone launched in 2007, users have navigated the web by making searches through Google. Now, consumers will enter a universe dominated by AI from multiple companies.LoadingInvestors saw the testimony as a bad omen for both Alphabet and Apple, which may have to abandon a lucrative arrangement.Alphabet shares tumbled as much as 9.4 per cent on Wednesday, their biggest intraday decline since October 2023. Apple shares also slumped on Cue’s comments, slipping as much as 2.7 per cent. The S&P 500 Index briefly flipped into the red, erasing an earlier gain that had topped 0.5 per cent.Apple currently offers OpenAI’s ChatGPT as an option in the Siri digital assistant and is expected to add Gemini, Google’s AI search product, later this year. Cue said Apple also looked at Anthropic, Perplexity, China-based DeepSeek and Grok from Elon Musk’s xAI for this purpose. He said the agreement with OpenAI allows it to add other AI providers to the company’s operating system, including Apple’s own.Before ChatGPT was chosen last year as part of Apple Intelligence in iOS 18, there was a “bake-off” with Google, Cue said. He said Google had provided a term sheet that “had a lot of things Apple wouldn’t agree to and didn’t agree to with OpenAI.”Eddy Cue (left), Bain Capital’s Steve Pagliuca and Apple chief Tim Cook last year.Credit: BloombergTechnology is changing fast enough that people may not even use the same devices in a few years, Cue said. “You may not need an iPhone 10 years from now as crazy as it sounds,” he said. “The only way you truly have true competition is when you have technology shifts. Technology shifts create these opportunities. AI is a new technology shift, and it’s creating new opportunities for new entrants.”Cue said that, in order to improve, the AI players would need to enhance their search indexes. But, even if that doesn’t happen quickly, they have other features that are “so much better that people will switch”.“There’s enough money now, enough large players, that I don’t see how it doesn’t happen,” he said, referring to a switch from standard search to AI.Cue also said that large language models — the underlying technology for generative AI — will continue to improve, giving users more reason to change their habits.Still, he believes Google should remain the default in Safari, saying that he has lost sleep over the possibility of losing the revenue sharing from their agreement. He said Apple’s pact with Google today for regular search still has the most favourable financial terms.LoadingCue manages offerings like iCloud, TV+ and Apple Music, but he’s also known as the company’s chief deal maker. Any losses from the search partnership being broken up would be reflected on the financial results for his division. The services group has been a major bright spot for the company in recent quarters as sales of hardware have slowed. The unit generated a record $US26.6 billion during the March period.Cue’s group is likely to further lose revenue after a judge ordered Apple to allow developers in the US to pay for in-app items outside the App Store, costing Apple up to 30 per cent of revenue on each transaction.Last year, Apple and Google expanded their deal to include Google Lens integration as part of the Visual Intelligence feature on the latest iPhones. That allows a user to take a picture and use Google AI to analyze it. Cue also said that its agreement with Microsoft’s Bing — a non-default option in Safari — was recently amended to be a year-to-year arrangement.Apple’s own AI technology has lagged behind those of peers. The company doesn’t have a AI search engine and has been forced to delay major upgrades to Siri that would have used a customer’s personal data to help fulfil queries. The company is holding its annual developer conference starting June 9, when it plans to introduce improvements to Apple Intelligence, its AI platform.BloombergGet news and reviews on technology, gadgets and gaming in our Technology newsletter every Friday.

He had been cancer-free for almost two years.The treatment was developed with the help of Georgina Long from the Melanoma Institute, who was jointly given the Australian of Year award with Professor Scolyer.\\xa0Sadly, in March this year, he revealed the cancer had returned.\\xa0'I'm still here and still able to chat to you so I'm pretty pleased about that,' Professor Scolyer told ABC News Breakfast on Thursday.'Who knows how long I've got.

Spending more time with my family is number one, but also contributing to society. It's something I've done for a long, long time.' Professor Richard Scolyer (pictured) has revealed he may only have a few months to live after his brain cancer returned this year Professor Scolyer had initially been diagnosed with a glioblastoma, which has a particularly aggressive nature - most sufferers survive less than a year.The bulk of the tumour was stripped shortly after the diagnosis.Then followed a series of experimental therapies based on his own melanoma research, including immunotherapy, 'debulking' surgery and a 'cancer vaccine' .In May last year, the University of Sydney professor declared that he had been cancer-free for nearly 12 months.But five months later, the decorated scientist revealed an MRI had shown an area of concern.\\xa0He underwent exploratory surgery which confirmed the cancer had returned.The 2021 Order of Australia recipient remains philosophical about his journey, stating that he 'just wants to make a difference'.\\xa0He is a prolific author having penned more than 700 publications and book chapters on melanoma pathology, which garnered him a reputation as one of the world's leading experts in the field.

That’s what you’d think, anyway. But some flavonoids are actually famous for their bitter taste, and can cause astringency — the dry, sometimes numbing sensation that’s created in the mouth when we consume certain foods and beverages. But flavonoids aren’t all bad. They’re anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-carcinogenic. And a new study shows that that’s not the extent of their health benefits, either. Appearing in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, the study suggests that tasty flavonoid-filled foods and beverages — like black tea, berries, citrus, and apples — could contribute to healthy aging. Specifically, it found that higher consumption of flavonoids could reduce our risk of frailty, poor physical function, and poor mental health as we age. “The goal of medical research is not just to help people live longer but to ensure they stay healthy for as long as possible,” said Nicola Bondonno, a study author and a lecturer at Edith Cowan University, according to a press release. “Our research shows that people who consume more flavonoids tend to age better.”Read More: It's Important to Eat the Rainbow: How Phytochemicals in Fruits and Veggies Can Improve Your HealthAging Better with Black Tea or BerriesAs the human lifespan is extended, it is important to ensure that the human healthspan is extended, too. That’s the amount of time that we live happily and healthily, and it’s highly tied to our nutrition. Indeed, our nutrition — and particularly our intake of plant-based foods and beverages — is a crucial factor that contributes to our health as we age, and among the chemical compounds in those foods and beverages that are most implicated in healthy aging are flavonoids.“We know from previous research that people who have a higher flavonoid intake tend to live longer, and they are also less likely to get any of the major chronic diseases such as dementia, diabetes, or heart disease,” Bondonno said in the release.But despite what studies say about flavonoids’ broader health benefits, whether they’re connected to certain aspects of aging, including frailty, poor physical function, and poor mental health, isn’t well researched.Studying past survey responses from over 80,000 female and male participants, Bondonno and a team of researchers took a closer look at this potential connection. The participants’ responses, which were collected periodically over the course of 24 years, included information about their intake of flavonoid-filled foods and beverages and their physical and mental health as they aged. Read More: Throwing Away Fruit and Veggie Peels Is Like Throwing Out Key NutrientsFlavonoid Benefits for Females and MalesThe team’s analysis showed that the consumption of flavonoid-filled foods and beverages was associated with a reduced risk of frailty, poor physical function, and poor mental health. Specifically, females who consumed the most flavonoids were 15 percent less likely to experience frailty than those who consumed the least, and were also 12 percent less likely to experience poor physical function and poor mental health. Meanwhile, males who consumed more flavonoids saw a reduced risk of poor mental health. “Flavonoids are well known for reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, supporting blood vessel health, and even helping to maintain skeletal muscle mass — all of which are important for preventing frailty and maintaining physical function and mental health as we age,” said Aedin Cassidy, another study author and a professor at Queens University Belfast, according to the release.Though clearer connections were found in females than in males, the study stresses that the potential benefits of flavonoids for aging should not be dismissed by either demographic. That’s because the differences between the associations of females and males may not be the result of a sex-specific distinction, but of a study-specific one, connected to the timing of the survey follow-ups.“Overall, these findings underscore the potential for simple dietary modifications to impact overall quality of life and contribute to the [optimization] of healthy aging,” said Eric Rimm, another study author and a professor at Harvard T.H.

Newspaper columns and nightly discussions on TV news channels rang with calls for the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to take decisive action against Pakistan and “teach them a lesson” once and for all.But a fortnight after the attack, with no clear impending action or military mobilisation in sight, some had wondered whether India really intended to retaliate. “What is going on?” asked one senior military analyst on Tuesday. By 1am on Wednesday, that question was answered.In highly coordinated air and drone strikes, Indian missiles hit nine targets, both in the part of the Kashmir region administered by Pakistan and in Pakistan’s Punjab province. It was the first time since the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war that India had fired missiles into Punjab.India said it had struck at “terrorist infrastructure”: camps and madrasas that were connected to the two main Islamist militant groups, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, behind some of the deadliest terrorist attacks in India over the past three decades. It emphasised it had not taken aim at any Pakistani military bases or weaponry. The strikes also took place entirely from Indian airspace, an apparent lesson from its last confrontation with Pakistan in 2019, when an Indian military aircraft was shot down over Pakistan and its pilot taken captive.To some, it seemed as if India was giving Pakistan an “off ramp” with these strikes, to prevent them escalating. As was widely agreed by analysts, both countries and their allies can ill afford events spiralling out of their control into an all-out hot war, not seen between the two countries since 1999.Pakistan is already in the midst of the worst security crisis in decades, as it battles a surge in Islamist militants on its Afghan border and separatists in its south-western province of Balochistan. The country is also in the grip of an economic crisis, with the Sharif coalition government widely seen as weak and unpopular.Yet in the buildup to the strikes, Pakistan’s powerful army chief, Gen Asim Munir, had already vowed that Pakistan would more than match any aggression by India. After India’s strike, Pakistan was unequivocal in its response: it was nothing short of an “act of war” by India. It furthermore claimed to have shot down five of the Indian military aircraft that carried out the attacks – which the Indian government has not so far commented on – and made it clear that it intended to go further.A statement by Pakistan’s national security council accused India of “igniting an inferno” and said the Pakistan army had been authorised to respond to defend Pakistan’s sovereignty.Pakistan’s military has long been the most powerful institution in the country. With the Sharif government weakened, the decision of how to respond is widely acknowledged to be in the hands of Munir.For those hoping for a swift de-escalation of tensions, this is a cause of concern. Munir is known to be an ideological hardliner on India and his comments on Kashmir have already been seen as highly inflammatory in Delhi. He is also known as favouring aggressive action and projections of military strength over attempts at diplomacy.“The worry here is that General Munir is not a thinking general; he’s rash, he’s reckless and he’s highly nationalistic,,” said Ayesha Siddiqua, a Pakistan political scientist. “We’ve already seen his gung-ho approach.”Pakistan’s military may also see India’s decision to strike at least three locations, including a mosque, inside Punjab as a direct provocation that could warrant a powerful retaliation.Punjab is not only the political base of the Sharif family but also the military heartland of the country, home to the majority of soldiers and the army leadership. Indian missiles have not landed there for more than 50 years.It remains unclear what targets Pakistan might aim for. While Pakistan accuses India of funding cross-border terrorism, there are no equivalent militant camps it could strike over the border. And to strike directly against Indian army targets could be seen as a direct escalation of the conflict. What analysts did agree on was that Pakistan was likely to strike sooner than later – and the longer the wait, the greater the chance of escalation.To some, the greatest worry of all is that India and Pakistan may have lost the US as a third-party mediator. In their 75 years as neighbours and enemies, Pakistan and India have been brought back from the brink of conflict on multiple occasions by crucial intervention by the US, a country that commands unmatched power and influence on both sides of the border and has always been willing to get its hands dirty in their disputes.Yet with Donald Trump in charge of the White House, the mood is very different and he has shown little interest in getting involved. “They’ve been fighting for a long time. I just hope it ends very quickly,” Trump said dismissively, after news of India’s strikes broke.Siddiqua said that without the US as a powerful, neutral mediator, altercations between the two countries – who are both looking to claim victory – could easily spiral out of control. “My worry is that, for the first time, India and Pakistan might be on their own here,” she said.', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: India strikes Pakistan, escalating tensions over Kashmir\\nENTITIES: India, Pakistan, Narendra Modi, Asim Munir, Donald Trump, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed\\nEVENT: India conducted air and drone strikes on alleged terrorist infrastructure inside Pakistani territory after a deadly attack on Indian tourists in Kashmir.\\nCONTEXT: Escalation risks remain high without US mediation.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 49494, 'sourceId': 12506, 'url': 'https://www.techradar.com/cameras/photography/printique-photo-book-review', 'title': 'The Printique photo book I designed stunned me with its high-quality finish – even if it came at a premium price', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T16:50:08.000Z', 'content': \"Printique’s photo book service is simple and straightforward to use, offering a great range of templates that you can plug your pics into, while offering a high level of flexibility for anyone who wants to flex their design skills.

It offers a wide range of pre-formatted themes, while allowing you all the flexibility you need to design a truly custom photo book from scratch.If you’re just looking for quick and easy results, Printique’s photo books offer plenty of templates to choose from. Whether you’re looking for a clean and classy wedding photo book, a striking photography portfolio, or a photo album of your pet pupperino, there are a good number of options – although at 88 themes, its options are dwarfed by the more than 500 options listed by Mixbook. Just select a template and Printique will apply it to your whole project, then all you need to do is drag and drop your chosen snaps into the provided frames.For those who want a little more customizability, Printique also provides layouts you can drag into individual pages and spreads in your photo book. From full-bleed images that span both pages to inset grids of thumbnail-size pics, these make it easy to include more variation in layouts and really adapt your book to fit your photos, rather than the other way around.But what if you don’t want to color within the lines? What if you want to make a completely original photo book from scratch? Well there’s good news: building my own DIY Printique photo book was a snap, easily rivaling the best photo book services.Placing images is simple: I just dragged my photos onto the page and they’d be added as image frames. On top of this, Printique’s built-in snap functionality made it easy to align them with each other or clip them to each spread’s margins. It even allows for really granular control over the size and position of image frames: the pop-up menu’s Properties section let me manually set images to specific dimensions and XY coordinates, as well as checking the DPI of each one to ensure it would print at a decent resolution.There was the occasional bug here though – some images stubbornly insisted on defaulting to weirdly specific decimals like 4.97 inches, and resisted all of my attempts to set them to a whole integer. Odd behavior, but ultimately not a deal breaker.Recreating the colored blocks and ribbons from TechRadar’s photo book test template was also pretty painless. Printique offers a range of shapes that you can add to your projects, and these are all super-flexible: I could precisely control their dimensions, add borders, and apply drop shadows from the properties menu. I was also able to change their color by entering a HEX code, setting RGB values or dragging a cursor to set saturation or brightness. However, the latter exhibited some odd behavior – changing either value would cause the color I’d chosen to creep away from my chosen hue, which occasionally proved irritating when I had a specific tone in mind.(Image credit: Future)Adding captions and credits to my photo book was also easy. Once I’d dropped a text box onto the page, I quickly was able to choose the font, size, styling and alignment. A small time-saver I especially appreciated is the ability to save chosen font settings as a style, which made it easy to achieve a consistent look for text throughout my photo book.Thanks to some extra settings, it’s possible to get really creative with your layouts. First, Printique provides a wide range of shaped frames that allow you to show off your pics in rounded, slanted or even letter-shaped frames. While some of these are potentially a bit cheesy – star-shaped frames anyone? – they do add a high degree of flexibility that allows you to create some sleek, professional-looking designs.You can also add extra flourishes and detail to your photo book using Printique’s background and sticker tools. Backgrounds offer everything from customizable block colors to a wide array of illustrations and patterns. Meanwhile, the stickers allow you to add pre-formulated text and illustrations to your photo book, from inscriptions about love to holiday iconography. Personally, some of the stickers aren’t to my tastes, giving things a distinctly clip-art vibe, but there are still a lot of choices there that could make useful ornaments to your text.You will have to pay a premium for such powerful tools, however. Printique’s photo books were marginally more expensive than some of the other services we've tested. A 12 x 12 inch photo book cost $145.78 including delivery (roughly £112), whereas Shutterfly cost $132.5 (roughly £102) and Mixbook cost $133 (£102.25). It’s only a tiny price increase though, and I would argue one that’s more than worth it, given the flexibility of Printique’s platform.(Image credit: Future)Printique photo book review: performanceFinished product reviewed byFinished product reviewed byPhilip BerneThe printed photo book we received from Printique offered very high-quality results, with extra-thick pages and consistently good color and accuracy. Hues looked excellent throughout, whether it was a bright, sunny photo or more nuanced fog with creamy bokeh.All of the photos were arranged perfectly, exactly as we set them, with no printing errors or unexpected margins. The book excels at photos that cross the binding, with a consistent look that feels mostly unbroken, allowing for very large spreads. I especially liked the brightness of the print and paper on our magenta TechRadar signature cover pages. Branding from Printique was minimal, but still present.The heavy feel of the Printique photo book adds a nice bit of gravity to photos with the weight of the paper. I was almost worried that I would tear the heavy paper as I turned the pages, but the book held its binding nicely, and the photos feel even more special on such a thick presentation. This would make a fine photo book for wedding photography, very special occasions, or to highlight the best shots in your portfolio.The pages may be a bit too thick if you're printing a large volume of work, and I still worry about those thick pages tearing with constant turning over the years. But for making a selection of photos feel extra premium, Printique’s photo books are a great choice.(Image credit: Future)Should I buy the Printique photo book?Buy it if…You want a high degree of customizabilityWhether it’s precisely controlling image dimensions, adding shaped image frames, including shapes in every color of the rainbow, or stamping your book with illustrations, you’re free to customize your photo book your way.You want a polished final productWith quality tactile paper, vivid colors and unerringly precisely alignments, Printique's photo books are finished to an excellent standard, making them a gorgeous gift for loved ones.Don’t buy it if…You want big savingsThere are cheaper photo book services out there. While Printique offers one of the best services we’ve tried, you can absolutely save some money elsewhere.You want a huge array of ready-to-go templatesPrintique has a decent number of templates for you to start plugging your photos into, but if you don’t care about customizability and just want the most prefabricated options, services like Mixbook offer many more.Printique photo book review: also considerMixbookWith over 500 templates locked and loaded, Mixbook is a great choice if you want a no-hassle layout without needing to get into the nitty-gritty of creating your own designs. However, during our Mixbook photo book review we did find there were a few marks left by the printing process, so it’s worth bearing this in mind if you’re considering it for a gift.MimeoFor sheer simplicity, Mimeo can’t be beat – its stripped-back offering allows you to just get on with the design without having to wade through too many options. However, it is pricey. Creating a 10 x 10-inch layflat photobook – the closest you can get to the 12 x 12 inch one we created here – will set you back $169.51 (£133.11) and that’s not including the $13.99 (around £10.80) shipping fee.

I followed this as closely as possible, sizing images according to precise measurements, adding colored shapes in specific hues and shades, and recreating captions and credits in specific fonts and styles, allowing me to assess how easy it was to recreate specific designs that users might have in mind.Our US Mobiles Editor Philip Berne then assessed the final product, analyzing its overall quality and finish, and comparing it to the template to identify any potential errors in the printing process.Additionally, I spent several hours playing around with the platform’s templates, layouts, shaped frames and illustrations to see how effective its off-the-shelf design elements were.I’m an experienced photographer, having spent many years shooting both on my Canon DSLR and my iPhone 16 Pro. I’ve also spent many years working in print, creating layouts for magazines and doing post-production on images, meaning I've spent a lot of time using design tools for producing printed products.First reviewed: May 2025Read more about how we test\\nReviews EditorJosh is Reviews Editor at TechRadar.

Pakistan’s bombardment of Indian-administered Kashmir on Wednesday night was, according to locals and experts, the most intense shelling that villages and towns in the region have seen in more than 40 years.\\n“This was a night of terror,” Rameez Choudhary, a resident of Poonch, told Al Jazeera.\\nThe dead, officials told Al Jazeera, included two siblings who were crushed to death after an exploding shell dropped on their house; two local store-owners who were hit by the raining munitions; a seven-year-old child; a teenage boy; a 35-year-old homemaker; and four other men.\\nThe worst-hit villages in Poonch district were Shahpur, Mankote and Krishna Ghati, while shelling also intensified in Rajouri district’s Laam, Manjakote, and Gambhir Brahmana areas as residents fled to safety.\\nA residential house is pictured after it was damaged by cross-border shelling in Salamabad in Indian-administered Kashmir’s Baramulla district, May 7, 2025 [Reuters]\\n‘This war has been forced upon us’\\nThe border skirmishes have followed the deadly attack at the tourist resort town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir two weeks ago, in which 26 people, mostly Indian visitors holidaying in the disputed region, were killed.\\nDuring the wee hours on Wednesday, Indian military warplanes arced across the skyline and fired missiles and other munitions into neighbouring Pakistan. Indian authorities said they targeted at least nine locations inside Pakistan.\\nIndia charges Pakistan with supporting the armed group that attacked Indian tourists. Pakistan, however, has denied the accusation. India claims its missiles hit “terror base camps”, but Pakistan says the strikes killed 31 people, all of whom were “innocent civilians”.\\nThe scale and spread of the current military tensions – India struck four cities separated by hundreds of kilometres in Pakistan’s Punjab province, in addition to sites in Pakistan-administered Kashmir – make them even graver, in some ways, than the last war between the neighbours in 1999, say some experts.\\nBack then, servicemen from the Pakistani army had disguised themselves as rebel fighters and taken up positions in the snow-covered, craggy mountains of Kargil, territory under de facto Indian control, leading to a conflict. Hundreds of soldiers died on each side, but the battles were – unlike this week – contained to Kargil.\\n“This war has been forced upon us. The [Pahalgam] attack was aimed at provoking a situation in which we have no option but to strike back,” said Tara Kartha, director at the Centre for Land Warfare Studies (CLAWS), a New Delhi-based think tank, and a former official at India’s National Security Council Secretariat.\\nTo be sure, the countries came close to war in 2019 in the aftermath of the deadly attack in Pulwama town in South Kashmir when a suicide bomber blew up an Indian paramilitary motorcade, killing 40 Indian servicemen. Indian fighter jets fired missiles that struck Balakot in Pakistan-administered Kashmir.\\nBut according to Kartha, the current crisis is different.\\n“Both sides carefully managed 2019. Everything was kept confined to a certain limit. But this time, it has been brutal,” she said, while arguing that “India has been very mature”. Pakistan’s military and civilian government have, however, accused India of fanning the flames of war and escalating tensions.\\nCaught on the front lines of their confrontation are Kashmiris. On Wednesday, three different regions in Indian-administered Kashmir were struck by Pakistani shelling.\\n“Initially, we thought it was thunder. The skies rumbled at 1am,” Altaf Amin, a 22-year-old resident of Chandak village in Poonch, told Al Jazeera.\\nVillagers sit in a tractor trolley as they move to safer places as authorities evacuate residents living near the border with Pakistan, in Suchetgarh, in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir, May 7, 2025.

But now, it has stopped,” said Amin.\\nSocial media was quickly flooded with videos showing the severity of the human toll in the border shelling. A clip whose veracity was authenticated by Al Jazeera shows the bloodied body of a teenage boy being carried into a van in Poonch. One of his arms had been blown apart. The different segments in the same clip showed a lifeless body of a child, his head ripped open by a shell.\\nAmid it all, one refrain emerged loud and clear: “We don’t want war,” said Amin.\\nYet, there is also anger on the ground against local authorities.\\n“People in Poonch are angry because there was no attempt to get them evacuated,” Zafar Choudhary, a political analyst and veteran journalist based in the Jammu region, told Al Jazeera.\\nChoudhary said that the strikes from the Pakistani side should have been anticipated by the Indian government, and people should have been evacuated to avoid the casualties.\\n“But none of that happened, which has left people infuriated. There’s a feeling that whenever the trouble between the two warring nations has erupted in the past, it is the people of these hill regions who have borne its brunt,” he said.\\nSilent guns roar again\\nThe LoC traverses a 740km (459-mile) circuitous route through the mountains, forested ridges, alpine lakes and rivers of the disputed Kashmir region. The line came into being in 1949 after the newly independent India and Pakistan fought their first war over Kashmir, which was then one of the 565 princely states ruled indirectly by colonial Britain.\\nAs both countries rallied their militaries to claim the picturesque region, they eventually settled for a stalemate that forced them to recognise each other’s spheres of influence. The ceasefire line was given recognition by the United Nations, which tried to mediate a referendum in Kashmir so that its people could choose their future.\\nThe vote never happened, and both nations continued to spar occasionally along the disputed border. After the 1971 war that Pakistan lost to India, the ceasefire line was renamed as the LoC. In 2003, after a more than decade-long uprising in Kashmir began to subside, and both countries initiated a peace process to ease hostilities, India took advantage of the truce period to fence off its side of LoC with spools of concertina wire.\\nThe two countries agreed to a ceasefire deal that they renewed in 2021.\\nFour years later, that agreement effectively lies in tatters.\\nBroken glass pieces are seen on a carpet inside a residential house after it was partially damaged by cross-border shelling in Salamabad in Indian-administered Kashmir’s Baramulla district, May 7, 2025 [Reuters]\\n‘This shelling is unprecedented’\\nAmin, the villager in Chandak, said that although artillery duels have been common in the border area, the guns had fallen relatively silent since both countries reaffirmed the 2003 ceasefire deal four years ago. “We are familiar with cross-border shelling. But this shelling is unprecedented.”\\nAnother resident from Poonch, which is where most damage has taken place, said that people there have now started following a series of war protocols announced by the government, including building makeshift bunkers.\\nResidents said many schools in Chandak have been converted into relief centres, with provisions of food and other essentials.\\nNearly 260km (162 miles) away from Poonch district, the residents of Salamabad Uri, a border village in Baramulla district, northern Kashmir, have fled their homes, too.\\n“Last night, the shelling was so intense that two houses were burned down and many people were wounded in the fire from across the border,” Mushtaq Ahmad, 40, a cab driver from the village, said. Ahmad has now moved to the town of Uri.\\nSalamabad, which is ringed by a pine-covered massif that juts out into Pakistan, has been devastated by near-continuous shelling. Powerful blasts have ripped away corrugated iron roofs from homes, exposing them to harsh sunlight. The inferno caused by the shelling has blazed through neighbourhoods, leaving behind smouldering debris.\\n“We fear the worst,” said Ahmad, adding that his two daughters, aged 9 and 11, are frightened.\\n“They are asking why it happened? Would we be killed?” Ahmad says, adding that the cross-border shelling started at 2am on Wednesday, and left two minors – a 13-year-old girl and a four-year-old boy – wounded.\\nGhulam Muhammad Chopan, an 80-year-old resident, said that he felt too old to leave his home, but that there was no other option.\\n“At this age, I had to leave my house. At night, the firing was so intense that by dawn, the village was empty. Everyone fled,” he said.\\nIn Wuyan town in Pampore, a highland area surrounded by a maze of escarpments where the prized Kashmiri saffron grows, townspeople said they were jolted out of their sleep at 1:30am after they heard a loud booming sound.\\n“A fireball exploded with a flash,” said Gulzar Ahmad, a resident. “I could see two aircraft. One of them returned promptly. But the other one that exploded, its wreckage had fallen into a school playground. Later, it started emitting acrid smoke that drew a large crowd.”\\nPakistan claims it shot down five Indian fighter jets on Wednesday morning. While multiple independent reports suggest that at least three planes were indeed shot down, India is yet to confirm any such losses.\\nAs uncertainty lingers over the escalation of tensions between India and Pakistan, locals in Indian-administered Kashmir are fearful and uncertain about their future.\\nResidents have started hoarding food, fuel and other essential items, anxious and desperate to survive violence they never invited.\\n“War should never be rejoiced.

According to new research out of the Cornell SC Johnson College of Business, political affiliation could be one indicator of negotiation propensity.\\nAnalyzing data involving more than 56,000 actual real estate transactions, then conducting four more experiments with another 3,000 individuals, the researchers found that conservatives are more likely than liberals to negotiate prices.\\nOne possible reason: conservatives\\' strong belief in free-market values, which encourage buyers to look out for their own financial interests in business deals. The researchers also found that conservatives believe that price negotiation is fair no matter the seller—be it a dealership, a private seller, a stranger, even a friend.\\n\"Some people are really motivated to engage in price negotiation, and others tend to refrain from doing so,\" said Archer Yue Pan, Ph.D., lead author of \"Who Negotiates? The Political Psychology of Price Negotiations,\" published in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin.\\nThe senior author is Manoj Thomas, the Demir Sabanci Professor of Management and Marketing (SC Johnson College).\\nConservatives\\' stronger endorsement of \"fair-market ideology\"—the belief that free-market systems, and institutions that affect them, are not only efficient but also fair and legitimate—has been reported in previous research, most notably a 2003 study led by John Jost of New York University.\\n\"The key idea,\" Thomas said, \"is: To what extent do individuals believe that outcomes in free markets depend on deservingness? When people believe that the prices buyers get in free markets depend on their deservingness, they tend to see negotiation as their duty. They do their best to get the best price and start feeling guilty when they don\\'t negotiate.\"\\nPan and Thomas began their study by analyzing data from three sources: the residential real-estate market; and Google searches for two retail websites, one that allows price negotiation (eBay.com) and one that does not (Amazon.com).\\nFor the housing market analysis (study 1), the researchers obtained weekly transaction data—including the asking and selling prices—from Redfin for 2017 for every county in the U.S., and merged that with both county-by-county results from the 2016 U.S. presidential election, obtained from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Election Data and Science Lab, and county-by-county demographics from the U.S. Census Bureau.\\nThey computed the average sale-to-list ratio (sale price divided by list price), in which a smaller average ratio in a county would indicate greater negotiation propensity. That figure was combined with the percentage of Republican votes in the county and the demographic information. The researchers found that counties that voted Republican showed a significantly lower sale-to-list ratio, indicating increased negotiation.\\nSimilar results came out of study 2: Counties that voted Republican had more Google searches for eBay than for Amazon.\\nIn addition to analyzing publicly available data, Pan and Thomas also collected their own data, examining: the role of ideology in negotiation propensity (study 3); whether endorsing free markets would spur participants to embrace that ideology, and in turn, negotiation behavior (study 4); and whether conservatives\\' sensitivity to economic threats (5a) or aggression toward groups not of the same mind, known as \"outgroups\" (5b), play a role.\\nAll studies pointed to the same result: Conservatives show a greater propensity to negotiate price than liberals. But study 4 showed that liberals\\' willingness to negotiate price could be increased by \"priming\" an individual—extolling the virtues of free-market ideology, then asking about their willingness to negotiate price.\\n\"Our aim was to show how our cultural environment influences ideological beliefs,\" Thomas said. \"If you\\'re surrounded by people who say that free markets offer fair outcomes only to people who deserve them, then your behavior will change.\"\\nThe overall findings, the researchers wrote, show that shopping behaviors aren\\'t just about money. They\\'re also shaped by personal beliefs about how the economy should work.

However, this new feature has required Nintendo to change its privacy policy: The company has disclosed that it may record Switch 2 audio and video chat sessions held between players.In a recent update to its privacy policy, Nintendo explained, \"We may collect, monitor and record audio and video of your chat sessions with other users to provide a safe and secure environment for certain of our services.\" This data collection is done with the player\\'s consent--which, if other consoles are anything to go by, could take the form of a clause in the terms of use for the chat functionality or an opt-in screen. Further, Nintendo specifically states that this recording process is done to \"enforce our terms,\" which could include both safety policies and legal requirements.\\nTap To Unmute\\nWant us to remember this setting for all your devices?\\nSign up or Sign in now!\\nPlease use a html5 video capable browser to watch videos.\\nThis video has an invalid file format.\\nSorry, but you can\\'t access this content!\\nNow Playing: Everything You Need To Know From The Nintendo Switch 2 Direct\\nRecording video and audio chats is not unique to Nintendo, and in fact this brings the company\\'s approach in line with Xbox and PlayStation. Microsoft, for instance, states that it collects data from Xbox chat sessions, at least in part to power Xbox\\'s voice chat reporting functionality for safety enforcement. PlayStation party sessions and voice chat are also recorded to some extent for safety and security.As voice and video chat functions have become more widespread and integral parts of gaming ecosystems, companies have rolled out increasingly sophisticated capabilities for recording, analyzing, and acting on the data that these produce. While it is often difficult to know the full extent of what companies are using this data for, much of it has to do with ensuring compliance with privacy and safety laws and enforcing community standards. Because of the legal ramifications of violations of some of these laws, some specialist companies have emerged to provide services in the voice and video chat safety space.Right now, it is unclear exactly how Nintendo intends on using recordings for safety enforcement, and the company has not detailed what types of systems it will employ. We have reached out to Nintendo for comment and will update this story with any additional detail if we hear back.

I don’t feel that way. I haven’t felt anything for GTA since I pre-ordered San Andreas. I was really hyped for that. Since then, I’ve been pretty let down by the series. Maybe in the future Rockstar will remake their older games, properly in the new engine.\\nI guess we don’t know anything apart from it looks OK. Not the mind-blowing graphics some people are spouting about.\\nI hope they’ve redone the movement controls and shooting mechanics. These haven’t changed since GTA 3 for goodness sake.\\nAs for the fact it has cost so many hundreds of millions, what do you expect when they’re basically making a Bad Boys interactive film?Bobwallett\\nGC: Trailer 2 got 475 million views in just 24 hours; it’s easily the most anticipated media release of all time, never mind just games.\\nExpensive logoI really don’t know what Microsoft is hoping to achieve with either this newly leaked handheld or their next gen one. We already know that these PC portables don’t sell that well, so why do they think theirs is going to be any different? Because it has an Xbox logo on it? If things were that simple the Xbox Series X/S wouldn’t be in the state it is.\\nThe only thing that would make sense to me is if it was a portable streaming device, which I’m sure it will be able to do, but the thing that’s out this year just looks like a ROG Ally with a different paint job, and those things are very expensive.\\nAnd the next gen device is going to have the biggest leap in technology ever, from one generation to a next? Not only do I not believe that for a second but if it does that’s not going to be cheap either. Or they’re talking about AI and it’ll be janky rubbish that doesn’t even work properly. None of that sounds like a good idea to me.Paulie\\nBerenstein universeOh hey, did you hear the amazing news? Sony just announced a brand new single-player game. A new IP that looks to be going back to their PlayStation 4 golden age, with an intense narrative, deep characters, and a lush open world to explore. I cannot wait, finally my purchase of a PlayStation 5 will be redeemed.\\nHang on, no. My mistake. They’ve announced a new studio called teamLFG that is made of people that have worked on nothing but live service junk. I just don’t know what’s going on anymore. Why does Sony hate making video games so much.Ladel\\nEmail your comments to: gamecentral@metro.co.uk\\nNot right nowI’ve got an alternative take on that EA price annoucement: ‘We wish we could increase the prices right now but our next two games are a bit dicey, so we can’t really take the risk. Rest assured, as soon as we’re convinced that people will once again buy our games no matter how bad they are, we’ll start charging £80 for them.’\\nYou watch, the second EA Sports FC gets back up to speed or Battlefield is a big hit they’ll suddenly need to increase the prices because of the cost of making games or some other trumped up nonsense, even though they didn’t need to this time, when they had to be more careful.\\nThe idea that any publisher will miss the opportunity to increase prices when others are doing it is laughable. Ironically, at the end of all this, Nintendo will probably end up being the cheapest again.Gadfly\\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web\\nbrowser that\\nsupports HTML5\\nvideo\\nGrand Theft EverythingGTA 6 is going to make so much money it’s scary. I do think that the Reader’s Feature at the weekend had a good point, in that it’s going to be so massive it’s just going to strangle all interest in everything else for potentially years.\\nGTA 5 is still in the top 10 for all formats and it’s getting on for 15 years old. Just imagine how popular GTA 6 is going to be. It’s not that it’ll just white out a few months either side of it. If people are already only playing a small number of old games all the time they could be on GTA 6, and nothing else, for the next 15 years.Penfold\\nWait and seeInteresting idea on what upcoming Switch 2 models we’ll see. The problem with a Switch 2 Lite is that the reason the Switch 2 is bigger than the original in the first place probably wasn’t a design choice, it’s down to the demand for extra space inside the thing for the jump forward in technology… especially the thermals.\\nAn OLED model is definitely a given, maybe with a marginally larger screen by cutting the bezels down like they did for the original. Also, with the cost of the console I can definitely see a TV-only version for a cheaper entry level device, which would be a new front for Nintendo. Dropping the portable hardware would save some cash in the manufacturing, especially now they’ve got a console that doesn’t produce graphics that look like a blurry/jaggy mess on large 4K TVs.\\nAs for pre-order, I’ll wait for the OLED one a few years down the road… given how far away a new Zelda likely is and that a new 3D Mario is still MIA I want Nintendo to prove they are ready to keep churning out the goods following this generational jump.\\nThere is also the question of third party support, multiformat titles will be noticeably inferior to PlayStation 5 so this thing will need more Monster Hunter Rises and Astral Chains to be seen as anything more than a first party machine. The Duskblood’s could be a good start and Nintendo should be commissioning many more second and third party exclusive titles via its vast money pile. The rumoured Final Fantasy 9 Remake being Switch 2 first would be enticing. Again it’ll take time, years even.\\nI guess my current (large) Switch backlog and Metroid Prime 4 will keep me sweet for a while yet.Marc\\nImpossible missionI have to say that the idea of Alex Garland making an Elden Ring movie is one of the least worst ideas I could think of, if they have to do it. They shouldn’t, because a movie doesn’t make sense given the way the story is, but if they have to this is probably the best way.\\nEither they ruin everything by explaining exactly what’s going on or they annoy and confuse ordinary punters by not explaining anything. Maybe there’s a sweet spot in the middle there, but I dunno. But if anyone can find it, Alex Garland probably could.PinkyPS: Really looking forward to 28 Years Later.\\nComing soonAnticipation is at a fever pitch, especially with the excellent trailer and beautiful screenshots of Grand Theft Auto 6 that released on Tuesday. Since there’s also a fair few excellent titles releasing through 2025 and beyond I’d like to take this time to list my 10 most anticipated titles.\\n10. The Outer Worlds 2 – an anticipated sequel and the continuation of the joy that is Spacer’s Choice.\\n9. Doom: The Dark Ages – a medieval setting and the most ambitious scope in the history of the franchise? Day one on Xbox Game Pass.\\n8. Fable – another Game Pass title. I’m optimistic for a reawakening of a dormant fantasy IP, but cautiously wary. Peter Molyneux ruined this franchise once.\\n7. The Duskbloods – FromSoftware. Directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki. A Switch 2 exclusive. Sign me up).\\n6. Crimson Desert – it looks stunning, and I will be pre-ordering this title. Exquisitely ambitious. Can’t wait for this one.\\n5. Exodus – taking inspiration from Mass Effect. It certainly looks to be living up to the legacy. Ambitious in scope. I look forward to learning more.\\n4. Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet – a new beginning for Naughty Dog. Spoken as a fan, I’m glad to see a new development that isn’t another retread of The Last Of Us.\\n3. Death Stranding 2: On The Beach – Kojima returns to the world of parcel delivery services and I am beyond ready. Bonus points to Higgs and his new look.\\n2. Ghost of Yōtei – Ghost Of Tsushima is one of my favourite games. I am deeply over the moon to see Atsu’s story unfold\\n1. Grand Theft Auto 6 – Never have I ever anticipated a title as much as I have this one. The first trailer blew me away. The second one has rocked my expectations. I will lose myself to this game and I will adore every second of it. I’m the most excited, happy, in love, and deeply drawn that I have ever been. I can’t wait for the privilege of playing this masterpiece.Shahzaib Sadiq\\nInbox also-ransJust saw a prediction that console prices (and I assume PC components) in the US could rise by 69% if tariffs go into full effect.

Last month's NFL Draft was held in Green Bay, while the 2026 showpiece is being staged in Pittsburgh.The National Mall is capable of holding several hundred thousands spectators, although the exact capacity for the 2027 NFL Draft has yet to be announced.'I don't think there's ever been in anything like that,' Trump said of staging the draft on the National Mall. 'That's a good idea... Maybe we could use it for other things also.'\\xa0Washington was selected as draft hosts just days after\\xa0Democrat\\xa0DC Mayor Muriel Bowser announced a plan to bring the team back to the city with a new arena on the site of the old RFK Stadium, where the team then known as the Redskins played until 1996.Currently, RFK Stadium stands on the site on the banks of the Anacostia River in the eastern part of the city. The building has been in the process of a prolonged demolition that has been delayed multiple times. The building was closed back in September 2019, but structural demolition has only begun this year.Trump also got involved in this year's draft, intervening on behalf of Shedeur Sanders as the quarterback plummeted through the first four rounds.\\xa0'What is wrong with NFL owners, are they STUPID?' Trump wrote on Truth Social. 'Deion Sanders was a great college football player, and was even greater in the NFL. He's also a very good coach, streetwise and smart!

He should be ''picked'' IMMEDIATELY by a team that wants to WIN. Good luck Shedeur, and say hello to your wonderful father!'When asked why he hit out at 'stupid' NFL owners for passing on the 23-year-old following the opening round, Trump\\xa0credited Sanders' Hall of Fame father Deion and his support.\\xa0'His father is a big Trump fan and I like\\xa0 it when people are Trump fans,' he told Hewitt.

Although not attached to an actual game, the NFL Draft has become a major annual event and even drew 600,000 fans to Green Bay, the NFL's smallest market, last month.And it's even more popular on television, with Sanders' dramatic fall from a projected first-round pick to the 144th selection captivating audiences for three days.

For example, if it reads 93% that’s Google saying that your phone’s 100% charge is equivalent to a new battery (that is otherwise identical) being 93% charged.It also highlights if your phone’s battery health is normal or not – all batteries degrade over time, but you’ll know if it’s degrading faster than it should be – as well as links to articles which could improve your battery health.Better battery, better lifeAndroid 16 should be detailed soon (Image credit: Google / Future)It doesn’t necessarily add new protective measures – like the Google Pixel 9a’s Battery Health assistance – but it should nevertheless be a handy tool for contextualising why battery health measures are useful, and offer you useful tips if you are struggling to look after your phone’s battery.So it’s a shame to discover that, according to Google in an Android 16 beta bug report (via, the feature which is currently “supported in Beta 3 on Pixel 8a and Pixel 9 products including 9 Pro Fold” won’t be coming to older Pixel devices due to “product limitations.”Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Google’s phrasing strongly suggests only Pixel 8 phones and newer will get the latest battery health tools – it does leave open the door for it to come to older devices when Android 16 launches in full, though we aren’t holding our breath.(Image credit: Peter Hoffmann)Battery health is one of the least flashy but most useful tools software updates can provide.Whether you replace your phone every two years or every five, knowing your device will be as reliable as possible for as long as possible is something we all appreciate. Afterall, no one likes those moments of terror as your phone’s battery ticks down at the worst possible time.Alongside battery changes Android 16 will include a major visual refresh, a new and improved desktop mode, and USB hack protections.You might also likeThese are the best Samsung Galaxy phones right nowThe Galaxy Watch 8 is already being leakedYour Android phone is about to look very different\", 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Android 16 battery tools skip older Pixels\\nENTITIES: Google, Android 16, Pixel 8, Pixel 9\\nEVENT: Google confirms that new battery health tools in Android 16 will not be available for older Pixel phones.\\nCONTEXT: Battery health tools will be exclusive to Pixel 8 and newer devices due to product limitations.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 52928, 'sourceId': 12706, 'url': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-14686475/John-Terry-CHANGED-penalty-order-Champions-League-final-defeat-Man-United-former-Chelsea-team-mate-Blues-captain.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490', 'title': \"John Terry's 'late change to agreed 2008 Champions League final penalty order' is exposed by Chelsea...\", 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T17:24:00.000Z', 'content': \"John Terry's 'late change to agreed 2008 Champions League final penalty order' is exposed by Chelsea team-mate, who says captain 'tried to be a hero' and names whose place he took\\n09:23, 07 May 2025, updated\\n18:24, 07 May 2025\\nBy\\nJAMES COHEN\\nJohn Terry missed his penalty in the Champions League final back in 2018A former team-mate has now revealed that Terry changed the shootout order\\xa0LISTEN NOW: It's All Kicking Off!

As India struck Pakistan on Wednesday in retaliation, Ms. Narwal became shorthand for why India picked the name “Operation Sindoor” for its military action.Sindoor, or vermilion powder, is a traditional marker of the marital status of Hindu women. Married women wear it either in the parting of their hair or on their foreheads, and they wipe it off if they become widowed. During the April 22 terrorist attack, many women lost their husbands, who were targeted because they were Hindu. But few received the media attention that Ms. Narwal has after the image of her by her husband’s side went viral.The Indian government’s choice of the name Operation Sindoor signaled its intention to avenge the widowed women. On social media, the Indian Army announced the strikes with a stark image that included a jar of spilled sindoor, which resembled spattered blood.“Operation Sindoor” also signals to right-wing Hindu groups — many of which favor more traditionally defined gender roles — that the Hindu nationalist government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is listening to their demands for vengeance.ImageCarrying the body of Vinay Narwal, a naval officer who was killed in the attack last month.Credit...Bhawika Chhabra/ReutersBut some feminists have criticized the use of the word sindoor.Hindu nationalism is predominantly driven by a male view of the world, said V.

This damages neurons in the brain that create dopamine, a neurotransmitter that controls movement.\\xa0Additionally, the foods quickly get absorbed into the bloodstream and attack the microbiome, a community of 'friendly' bacteria that live in the gut and communicate with the brain. Harmful bacteria creates inflammation in the brain that destroys dopamine-producing neurons.\\xa0The experts believe cutting down on ultraprocessed food consumption may slash the risk of developing Parkinson's years or decades before it would be diagnosed.\\xa0 Researchers in China found consuming 11 servings of ultraprocessed foods per day raised the risk of developing early Parkinson's signs by 2.5 times (stock image) Symptoms of Parkinson's include uncontrollable tremors, slow movements and muscle stiffness Outside researchers, however, cautioned that these early signs are not definitive indicators a patient will go on to develop Parkinson's.\\xa0Dr Xiang Gao, study author from Fudan University in China, said: 'Eating a healthy diet is crucial as it has been associated with a lower risk of neurodegenerative diseases and the dietary choices we make today can significantly influence our brain health in the future.'There's growing evidence that diet might influence the development of Parkinson's disease. Our research shows that eating too much processed food, like sugary sodas and packaged snacks, might be speeding up early signs of Parkinson's disease.'Parkinson's is diagnosed in about 90,000 Americans every year and is caused by the death of nerve cells in the brain that produce dopamine, which controls movement.The condition is also on the rise in the US and UK, which is thought to be caused by a rapidly aging population, environmental toxins and lifestyle choices like smoking.In the UK, there are about 18,000 new diagnoses every year in people 45 and older.\\xa0\\xa0Parkinson's disease is a progressive movement disorder in which the brain can't produce enough dopamine, a neurotransmitter that controls movement. A lack of dopamine leads to issues like tremors, falls, trouble swallowing and mobility issues.The new study, published Wednesday in the journal Neurology, followed 42,853 people who did not have Parkinson's at the start of the study. They were then followed for up to 26 years.Participants underwent regular medical appointments and filled out diaries every two to four years detailing what they ate and how often.\\xa0Researchers divided foods into four categories:\\xa0unprocessed or minimally processed foods, processed culinary ingredients, processed foods and ultraprocessed foods.\\xa0Ultraprocessed foods included were: sauces, spreads, or condiments; packaged sweets; snacks or desserts; artificially or sugar-sweetened beverages; animal-based products; yogurt or dairy-based desserts; and packaged savory snacks.One serving was considered one can of soda, one ounce of potato chips, one slice of packaged cake, one hot dog or one tablespoon of ketchup.\\xa0Early Parkinson's symptoms evaluated were\\xa0sleep behavior disorders, constipation, depressive symptoms, body pain, impaired color vision, excessive daytime sleepiness and reduced ability to smell.The researchers found consuming 11 servings of ultraprocessed foods every day raised the risk of developing at least three early Parkinson's symptoms by 2.5 times compared to people who consumed three or fewer servings.\\xa0Additionally, even three or fewer servings raised the risk. Sauces and condiments had the smallest increase at 17 percent while packaged sweets raised the risk 60 percent.\\xa0\\xa0Dr Gao said: 'Choosing to eat fewer processed foods and more whole, nutritious foods could be a good strategy for maintaining brain health.'More studies are needed to confirm our finding that eating less processed food may slow down the earliest signs of Parkinson's disease.'The researchers believe additives in ultraprocessed foods like emulsifiers and sweeteners promote oxidative stress, an imbalance between disease-fighting antioxidants and harmful free radicals.Free radicals attack the body's cells and tissues. In Parkinson's disease, they damage neurons that produce dopamine, a neurotransmitter that regulates movement.\\xa0 Actor Michael J Fox (pictured here) was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease at just 29 years old. He now advocates for more research into the condition Ultraprocessed foods are also thought to induce inflammation in the brain, which further attacks the neurons responsible for dopamine production.The study's main limitation was that participants self-reported their ultraprocessed food intake, so it's possible they may not have accurately calculated or remembered how many servings they had.\\xa0Dr Katherine Fletcher, research lead at Parkinson's UK, said: 'Research into diet in general is difficult as people often will inaccurately self-report what their diet comprises. This could be down to forgetting to fill in the diary at the time, to subjective interpretation of amounts of UPFs.'The study group also lacked ethnic and socio-economic diversity, which is vital when looking to better understand factors that contribute to the causes of a health condition.'Dr Daniel J van Wamelen, clinical senior lecturer in neuroscience and Honorary Consultant Neurologist at King's College London, noted while the results are 'interesting,' more definitive research is still needed.\\xa0\\xa0He said: 'It is important to highlight that the symptoms examined in this study are possible early signs of Parkinson’s disease, not definitive indicators that someone will go on to develop it. The study did not track whether participants were diagnosed with Parkinson’s later on. 'Many of the individual symptoms noted, such as sleep disturbances, constipation, and mood changes, are common in the general population. While the study found that people who ate more ultra-processed foods tended to report more of these non-motor symptoms, it did not find a direct increase in the risk of Parkinson’s disease itself.\\xa0'The connection to Parkinson’s disease should be viewed with caution until more definitive evidence becomes available.'\", 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Ultraprocessed food linked to Parkinson's risk\\nENTITIES: Parkinson's disease, Chinese scientists, Dr Xiang Gao, Fudan University, Michael J Fox, Dr Katherine Fletcher, Parkinson's UK, Dr Daniel J van Wamelen, King's College London\\nEVENT: Study finds high consumption of ultraprocessed foods correlates with increased risk of early Parkinson's symptoms; additives may damage dopamine-producing neurons.\\nCONTEXT: Ultraprocessed food consumption linked to early Parkinson's signs.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 51493, 'sourceId': 12671, 'url': 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48596605', 'title': 'What is the infected blood scandal and how much compensation will victims get?', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T07:22:50.000Z', 'content': 'Image source, Getty ImagesBy Jim ReedHealth reporterGovernment officials have been called to give evidence to a special session of the infected blood inquiry amid \"grave concerns\" about the speed of compensation payments.The inquiry\\'s chair, Sir Brian Langstaff, made the unusual decision to take fresh evidence nearly a year after his final report into the scandal.More than 30,000 people in the UK were infected with HIV and hepatitis C after being given contaminated blood products in the 1970s and 1980s.As many as 140,000 bereaved parents, children and siblings of victims may also be able to claim compensation in their own right. Who was given infected blood and how many died?Two main groups of NHS patients were affected by what has been called the biggest treatment disaster in the history of the NHS.Firstly, haemophiliacs - and those with similar disorders - who have a rare genetic condition which means their blood does not clot properly., externalPeople with haemophilia A have a shortage of a clotting agent called Factor VIII, while people with haemophilia B do not have enough Factor IX. In the 1970s, a new treatment using donated human blood plasma was developed to replace these clotting agents.But entire batches were contaminated with deadly viruses.After being given the infected treatments, about 1,250 people in the UK with bleeding disorders went on to develop both HIV and hepatitis C, including 380 children.Media caption, Colin Smith, who died aged seven, was one of 380 children now thought to have been infected with HIV through contaminated blood products.About two-thirds later died of Aids-related illnesses. Some unintentionally gave HIV to their partners.Another 2,400 to 5,000 people developed hepatitis C on its own, which can cause cirrhosis and liver cancer. It is difficult to know the exact number of people infected with hepatitis C, partly because it can take decades for symptoms to appear. A second group of patients were given contaminated blood transfusions after childbirth, surgery or other medical treatment between 1970 and 1991.The inquiry estimates that between 80 and 100 of these people were infected with HIV, and about 27,000 with hepatitis C.In total, it is thought about 2,900 people have died. What did the infected blood inquiry say? Announcing its findings in May 2024, the inquiry said victims had been failed \"not once, but repeatedly\", and that the risk of viral infections in blood products had been known since 1948.Inquiry chairman Sir Brian Langstaff said there had been a lack of openness from the authorities and elements of \"downright deception\", including the destruction of documents.He said half-truths were also told, so people did not know about the risk of their treatment, the availability of alternatives, or even whether they were infected.\"This disaster was not an accident,\" said Sir Brian. \"The infections happened because those in authority - doctors, the blood services and successive governments - did not put patient safety first.\"The Inquiry report, external said: too little was done to stop importing blood products from abroad, which used blood from high-risk donors such as prisoners and drug addictsin the UK, blood donations were accepted from high-risk groups such as prisoners until 1986blood products were not heat-treated to eliminate HIV until the end of 1985, although the risks were known in 1982there was too little testing to reduce the risk of hepatitis, from the 1970s onwardsHow much compensation will infected blood victims get?In October 2024, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said that the government had set aside £11.8bn to pay compensation to victims. It set up an independent arms-length body called the Infected Blood Compensation Authority (IBCA), external to administer payments.Both those infected by contaminated blood products and those affected by the scandal - such as partners, parents, children and siblings - can claim compensation for the impact on their lives. Payments are exempt from tax, and do not affect benefits. The final amounts for individuals are assessed against five criteria: harm caused, social impact from stigma and isolation, impact on autonomy and private life, care costs and financial loss.Outlining the compensation scheme after the inquiry reported in May 2024, the then-Conservative government suggested how much people might receive, external:a person infected with HIV could expect to get compensation of between £2.2m and £2.6mthose with a chronic hepatitis C infection, defined as lasting more than six months, could expect to receive between £665,000 and £810,000the partner of someone infected with HIV who is still alive today could expect to receive about £110,000, while a child could get £55,000Compensation payments will go to the estate of infected people who have died.But if a partner or relative who might be entitled to a payment has died, their estate will not receive any money.Have any compensation payments already been made?In late 2022, following advice from the inquiry, the Conservative government made interim payments of £100,000 each to about 4,000 surviving victims and bereaved partners. A second interim payment of £210,000 was paid to those infected in June 2024. In October 2024, the government said more relatives of those who died could also apply for £100,000 interim payments if the money had not already been claimed.The IBCA said, as of 6 May: 677 people have been invited to claim final compensation160 compensation payments totalling £150.2m have been offered106 compensation payments totalling £96.6m have been madeAn IBCA spokesman said its priority remained \"paying as many people as soon as possible\". It plans to ask an extra 100 individuals to start their claims every week from May 2025. It has also announced that it would start to prioritise payments to those who had less than 12 months left to live, external due to any medical condition. Victims and their relatives have criticised the time taken to make payments, and what they say is a lack of transparency about the claims process.On 9 April Sir Brian said he would re-open the inquiry on 7 and 8 May to take evidence about the speed of compensation payments. Government officials, including the cabinet office minister Nick Thomas-Symonds, will give evidence under oath and the sessions will be filmed and streamed online. Sir Brian said: \"The decision to hold hearings has not been taken lightly. It reflects the gravity of concerns expressed consistently and repeatedly to the inquiry.\"People infected and affected do not have time on their side.\"How did the infected blood scandal happen?In the 1970s, the UK was struggling to meet the demand for blood-clotting treatments, so imported supplies from the US. But much of the blood was bought from high-risk donors such as prison inmates and drug-users. Factor VIII was made by pooling plasma from tens of thousands of donors.If just one was carrying a virus, the entire batch could be contaminated.UK blood donations were not routinely screened for hepatitis C until 1991, 18 months after the virus was first identified.Image source, Jackie BrittonImage caption, Jackie Britton, from Portsmouth, was infected with hepatitis C through a transfusion after the birth of her daughter in 1983When did authorities know about infected blood?By the mid-1970s, there were repeated warnings that imported US Factor VIII carried a greater risk of infection. However, attempts to make the UK more self-sufficient in blood products failed, so the NHS continued using foreign supplies. Campaigners say haemophiliacs could have been offered an alternative treatment called Cryoprecipitate. This was much harder to administer, but was made from the blood plasma of a single donor, lowering the infection risk. BBC News has also uncovered evidence children were infected with hepatitis C and HIV after being placed on clinical trials of new treatments - often, without their family\\'s consent.As late as November 1983, the government insisted there was no \"conclusive proof\" that HIV could be transmitted in blood, a line robustly defended by former Conservative health minister Ken Clarke when he appeared before the inquiry. Media caption, Carolyn Challis: \"I got through two life-threatening rounds of cancer only to be given another life-threatening illness\"What happened in other countries affected by infected blood?Many other countries were affected, although some - including Finland - used older treatments until much later rather than switch to Factor VIII, which minimised HIV infections., externalDelivering the findings of the inquiry, Sir Brian criticised UK government claims in the 1990s that screening for hepatitis C began as soon as the technology was available.He said that 23 other countries - including Japan, Finland and Spain - introduced the screening before the UK.In the US, companies that supplied infected products have paid out millions in out-of-court settlements.Politicians and drug companies have been convicted of negligence in countries including France and Japan. In his evidence to the inquiry, former health secretary Andy Burnham suggested there may be grounds for charges of corporate manslaughter, external in the UK.Related internet linksThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.', 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Infected blood scandal: Compensation payment concerns raised\\nENTITIES: Sir Brian Langstaff, Rachel Reeves, Nick Thomas-Symonds, Infected Blood Compensation Authority (IBCA), UK government\\nEVENT: Infected blood inquiry re-opened to address concerns about the slow pace of compensation payments to victims infected with HIV and hepatitis C from contaminated blood products in the 1970s and 1980s.\\nCONTEXT: Victims criticize slow compensation payments and lack of transparency.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 50073, 'sourceId': 12577, 'url': 'https://www.vgchartz.com/article/464630/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-expansion-launches-july-15-star-wars-inspired-renegades-expansion-announced/', 'title': 'Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate Expansion Launches July 15, Star Wars-Inspired Renegades Expansion Announced', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T02:57:43.000Z', 'content': \"by\\nWilliam D'Angelo\\n, posted 1 day ago / 1,286 ViewsBungie has announced the the Rite of the Nine update for Destiny 2 is now available and\\xa0The Edge of Fate expansion will launch on July 15.\\nA Star Wars-inspired expansion titled Destiny 2: Renegades\\xa0was also announced.

It may also serve as a catalyst for engaging people in the long-term benefits of returning elk to the wild.”The same process was followed with beavers in England, which were first released into enclosures in wildlife areas around the country, before being legally released into the wild this year for the first time.The charity Rewilding Britain is awarding up to £15,000 to multiple rewilding initiatives, including the elk project and some that aim to restore bison and beavers to the landscape.Rebecca Wrigley, the chief executive of Rewilding Britain, said: “Keystone species like elk, bison and beaver play a vital role in bringing nature back to life. They help repair ecosystems and shape wild places in ways that benefit wildlife, people and the climate.“Successfully reintroducing missing species like these is absolutely crucial. It’s a complex process involving multiple stages of research and development, feasibility studies, impact assessments and community consultations. By taking the time and effort to get it right, we can create a more hopeful future for everyone.”European elk are closely related to the North American moose and can weigh up to 700kg (110 stone).

The evidence adds up: Over the 10 of 12 episodes provided to critics for review, human lie detector Charlie gets outsmarted by an elementary-schooler who’s like a cross between Wednesday Addams and Damien Thorn, experiences spiritual nirvana while gazing into the eyes of a captive gator, and more than once resembles the insouciant, constantly snacking Bugs Bunny. “Weird” is Charlie’s constant, and it’s not exactly new. What is new is how Poker Face decenters Charlie so its villains can shine. In this more episodic second season, Poker Face’s baddies are a stacked deck.\\nJohn Cho proving the old adage that everyone is hotter in sunglasses, James Ransone reprising elements of Ziggy Sobotka as a thrills-chasing thief, and John Mulaney losing his temper when someone misquotes Stephen Sondheim. Simon Rex harnessing all of his skeezy charmer powers, Method Man putting a new spin on a wellness-influencer grift, and Alia Shawkat evincing the hard edge we’ll sadly never get to see in a third season of The Old Man. Poker Face’s first-season guest stars vamped it up, too; think of the Mountain Goats front man John Darnielle, longtime friend of series creator Rian Johnson, making his acting debut as a thieving metal guitarist. But that season had a couple of issues that this round of Poker Face smartly sloughs off: an overarching story line involving Charlie’s cards-playing past that sometimes felt like a drag on the series’ forward momentum, an overreliance on law enforcement as a storytelling tool. The series feels looser as a result, more dug in to its concept of a road trip through a series of mini Elmore Leonard–style crime stories and more willing to cede the spotlight from Charlie to the murderers, con artists, and thieves facing off against her. Through Charlie’s Bugs Bunny mimicry, Poker Face transforms her from active participant to audience surrogate, sliding her into the role of easy-breezy observer who gestures toward the chaos and says through a mouthful of carrot, “Are you seeing this shit?” Fun, what a concept!\\nAdmittedly, it takes a little while to get to that sweet spot. Poker Face picks up some months after season-one finale “The Hook,” in which the FBI saved Charlie from murderous mob enforcer Cliff (Benjamin Bratt), Cliff testified against corrupt casino owner Beatrix Hasp (Rhea Perlman), and Hasp gave Charlie an ultimatum about working for her. Having refused Hasp’s offer, Charlie is on the run from a pair of assassins in the first three episodes, which premiere together on May 8. Unfortunately, season opener “The Game Is a Foot” is a sludgy try-hard of an hour in which Cynthia Erivo plays five sisters in the same family fighting over their mother’s inheritance. This is Poker Face at its flashiest — Erivo rushing through costume changes and doing a range of accents, whip pans around a funeral where no one is really that sad, commentary on how Hollywood throws away child stars once they’ve aged out of their roles — but also its sweatiest. There’s a desperation to “The Game Is a Foot” that Poker Face thankfully shakes off, and once “Last Looks” and “Whack-a-Mole” put season one’s organized-crime story line to bed, the series starts cooking.\\nPoker Face is in the groove when its plots are labyrinthine and its attention invested in the desperation of everyday people pushed to the brink, and season two settles into a fine groove as Charlie moves around the U.S. trying to figure out what she wants to do with her life. (Lyonne’s giant smile when she asks of a job opportunity, “Does it pay cash?” is a wonderfully telling detail about surviving off the grid.) Does Charlie miss having a community? She finds it in a group of animal-rights activists in Florida and a grandmother-and-granddaughter duo who watch Jeopardy! and Michael Clayton together in their rent-controlled NYC apartment. What about love? Corey Hawkins, playing a superstore manager who falls for Charlie while she’s doing deliveries for an Indian restaurant, is as flirtatious as he is kind. Are the cops constantly around to save her? Not so often, which helps the episodes’ endings avoid the same-y feeling they had the first time around. Those changes supply Charlie with more substantial relationships this season, and the varying ways they play out — some successful, some tragic, all affected in some way or another by Charlie’s ability to discern a lie — round out her characterization.\\nNow that Poker Face has hammered down its central gimmick and reemphasized its refusal to explain how it works (“That’s not really the point,” Charlie says), it can examine Charlie past her trick. Lyonne blunts her character’s edges with a warm smile and calmer affect as she lets her guard down around new friends, and then sharpens them again with staccato line deliveries and a persistent glare as the toll of so much death weighs on her. Charlie’s roiling interiority is a more engaging long-term through-line for Poker Face than her repetitive fleeing from either the police or the Five Families, and that emotional angle bestows a strong core the series’ goofy stuff can branch off of. The slapstick visuals of Charlie chomping into a giant turkey leg and vaping in a coffin; the twistiness of dialogue like “You want me to rat on my mole, like a snake?”; the joys of an episode-long homage to the perfection that is Michael Mann’s Heat and another that winks at the real-estate-related bloodshed of Only Murders in the Building. After the first season of Poker Face, it was hard to tell how much longer the series could stay in the game with its Lyonne-as-Columbo conceit. The confidence and recalibration of the second season raise that bet.\\nThe Four Seasons Is Probably Not Your Thing\\nI Can’t Believe Étoile Got Away With This\\nStar Wars Needed This\\nSee All\\nPoker Face Stacks the Deck', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: 'Poker Face' Season 2 Review\\nENTITIES: Natasha Lyonne, Charlie Cale, Rian Johnson, John Cho, James Ransone, John Mulaney, Simon Rex, Method Man, Alia Shawkat\\nEVENT: Review of 'Poker Face' Season 2 highlights guest stars and episodic format.\\nCONTEXT: Second season focuses on villains, Charlie as observer.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 52253, 'sourceId': 12389, 'url': 'https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a64594435/gmc-2025-hummer-ev-suv-review/', 'title': 'I Took the New Hummer EV for a Spin and It Was Better Than I Imagined', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T15:14:00.000Z', 'content': \"IT'S AROUND 2 P.M. on a cool Saturday afternoon, and I’m midway through a workout in an empty parking lot in upstate New York. There’s not a single barbell or weight machine in sight. Yet somehow, despite not having my big training staples, I’m keeled over, hands on my knees, lungs on fire.That’s because I just finished off my third set of seriously heavy work, dragging a GMC Hummer EV for about 30 seconds through a lot near the camping area in Hillside Park, up in Hastings-0n-the-Hudson. And I’ll be honest, I didn’t quite realize just how hard it would be (or how much it would rock my glutes and abs and lats and forearms) to haul an 8,500-pound behemoth of a vehicle in neutral with a pair of straps. This wasn't a normal workout, of course. Then again, when you're away for the weekend and tight on time, it makes for a good workout. It was a good reminder that my workout can take many forms, and with a vehicle like the Hummer EV, it can happen anytime, anywhere. That’s the true magic of the Hummer EV. GMC’s electric SUV isn’t just a terrific ride, but it’s a complete vehicle that lets you bring any part of your life anywhere – even into the middle of the woods. My weekend with GMC's monster felt like three days with a Transformer stripped from a Michael Bay flick. Not only did the EV survive three full days with just one charge-up, but it let me haul enough gear for two full workouts, and still had so much room that I took my parents and little brother out for dinner. Translation: Plenty of fun and versatility.An Electrifying ExperienceI’ve tested several electric cars before, but nothing could prep me for this Hummer. Its sheer size was eye-catching, and once I got inside, I felt incredibly at home. Few vehicles, even pickups, are as roomy as this Hummer, which comfortably seats five, with leg room to spare. An underrated bonus was the quality of the back seats, which were also heated: perfect for my 81-year-old father, who got in and out of the vehicle with surprising ease. The trunk space, meanwhile, was practically livable. I’m never sure how much gear I can fit into an SUV comfortably, so I only brought a few dumbbells, a kettlebell and a TRX. But you can easily fit a Rogue bench, and some medballs in there, too, which would have made for a more versatile workout. The only reason I talked myself out of that: I didn’t want to turn loading the vehicle into more of a workout. Courtesy of Samuel.When I headed from my home in Westchester, New York, to a restaurant with my parents, the Hummer EV showed off its greatest feature: Uncommon acceleration. I’m a speed guy (the kind who thinks about Corvettes). And I simply wasn’t ready for the Hummer EV to jump like that when I first hit the gas, easily bursting to 60 mph. None of that speed feels lumbering, either; the Hummer still handles itself with agility, and has so many features (sorry, crab walk!) I didn’t dare to even try. This is an SUV nerd’s dream with enough driving fun for this speed nerd, too. Training With the Hummer EVAnd . . . it satisfied the fitness nerd in me in next-level ways. A day later, when I reached Hillside Park, about 90 minutes from my house, I definitely wanted to rest. But the easiest way to get a workout done during a three-day weekend filled with travels and family is to bang that workout out first thing. So, despite feeling fatigued, I swiftly unloaded my gear from the Hummer EV, and got to work. And it’s then that I wished I’d gone ahead and packed that Rogue bench. I didn’t have anywhere to set up for dumbbell rows or other exercises. Except I did have this beast of a Hummer – and it has a host of places for me to lean on when I’m rowing. She’s a sturdy badass, too, barely rocking no matter how explosive I got with my dumbbell rows. I banged out a few sets of rows, squats, push presses, and curls, and definitely worked up a solid sweat.But I needed a workout finisher, and that’s where the Hummer EV really delivered. I popped her into neutral, and attached my TRX hooks to the front. Then, I started pulling. And no, it wasn’t easy, but it was plenty satisfying to drag the Hummer along for 30-second intervals, on and off. (I polished things off with a quick cooldown hike around the park.) The Hummer EV is the kind of vehicle that’s ready for anything. And it’s perfect for my lifestyle as both a huge fitness person who wants to work out and as a fitness trainer. One of the most underrated trends out there is the fitness truck, a trailer truck tricked out with dumbbells and barbells and battle ropes and other fitness gear, perfect for trainers aiming to work out clients on the road, or run group classes in parking lots. Often, these are trailer trucks. The Hummer EV is a better experience for trainers like me, who work one-on-one with clients, offering a much smoother (and nerdier but intensely super-cool!) ride, while delivering that ability to let me challenge clients (and myself) with the Hummer drag finisher. Is This the Perfect Vehicle? I’ve spent most of my life driving a 2001 Jeep Cherokee Sport (which I love and plan to keep until I die). It has 421,000 miles on it, though, so I’m aware that I may eventually need a new SUV in my life. But I’d never taken a trip in a vehicle that truly captivated me – until I met the Hummer EV.GMC’s ride delivered everything I want in an SUV, serving my parents comfortably and delivering a terrific thumping bass when I listened to Linkin Park and Kendrick Lamar with the windows down. The Hummer also added so many little touches that I’m destined to miss a few in this story (the view through the clear-glass Infinity View roof, both in the day and at night, was serene and deserves mention).Best of all perhaps: The GMC Hummer EV cured my range anxiety. I’ve shied away from creating a long-term relationship with an electric since taking one up north and returning home with just eight miles left on it. Despite taking the Hummer EV north and back twice, then driving it into Manhattan (and back) later, I ended my time with it with 70 miles left. The only thing more fun than that drive: dragging the thing for a workout.

This homogenous gang of three, as this play’s title identifies them, fail to claim the highest political prizes because they believe the inevitable winner is one of them.Written by political faction specialists Robert Khan and Tom Salinsky – whose earlier works Coalition, Kingmaker and Brexit examined aspects of the Cameron and Johnson years – the play shows the self-chosen big three of the Labour centre-right debating which of them should become deputy party leader in 1972 and 1976, prime minister in 1976 and leader of the opposition in 1980.As with events in Rome, there’s a sense of Labour conclaves, with the added problem that not all of the contenders were in the room; in each case, a pope of socialism was crowned elsewhere (Ted Short, Michael Foot, James Callaghan, Foot again). Still more daringly, another party, across Westminster, chose a female leader.The Tories having picked three more women (quality aside), while all Labour’s non-interim leaders have been male, is one of the play’s many subtle subtexts, alongside divisions between the trio including European membership and spending cuts.Subtle subtexts … Morgan, Tierney and Cox in The Gang of Three. Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianJust as the play seems to be following conventional bio-drama chronology, there’s a flashback to Oxford in 1940 in an intriguing scene dramatising a more intimate relationship between Crosland and Jenkins that, in John Campbell’s biography of Jenkins, is attributed only to “private information”. Finally, the play becomes an unofficial prequel to Steve Waters’ Limehouse, in which Jenkins, as part of the “gang of four” (with David Owen, Shirley Williams and Bill Rodgers), founded the SDP, with the aim of supplanting Labour – although, like Jenkins’ previous gambles, that failed, with Healey refusing to become the gang’s fifth member.Eschewing a bald cap (as used by Roger Allam in Limehouse), Hywel Morgan captures Jenkins’ delivery, rolling words around his mouth like the fine claret he carries in (a good in-joke about a political hero, this) a Gladstone bag. Colin Tierney as Healey nails the sudden French quotations and the habit, regardless of emotion, of speaking through gritted teeth. With the advantage or disadvantage of being the only character not impersonated by peak-time TV impressionists of the era, Alan Cox plays Crosland as a charmingly louche political chameleon – though, as the play shows, that wasn’t enough.\\nAt the King’s Head theatre, London, until 1 June', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Play reviews Labour's 'Gang of Three' intrigue\\nENTITIES: Denis Healey, Roy Jenkins, Anthony Crosland, Robert Khan, Tom Salinsky, Labour Party\\nEVENT: Play 'The Gang of Three' depicts Labour leaders' failed bids for power.\\nCONTEXT: Play examines Labour party's internal power struggles.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 53143, 'sourceId': 12737, 'url': 'https://www.film-news.co.uk/news/UK/118318/Mandy-Moore-slams-red-tape-around-rebuilding-after-LA-wildfires', 'title': \"Mandy Moore slams 'red tape' around rebuilding after LA wildfires\", 'publishDate': '2025-05-08T03:00:00.000Z', 'content': 'Mandy Moore has slammed the protocol surrounding the rebuilding of houses in the wake of the Los Angeles wildfires, calling it \"maddening and heartless\".

The bear was one of four cubs that emerged in May 2020 with their mother, Grizzly No. 399, who was often called the world's most famous grizzly bear. Grizzly No. 399, who was beloved for decades by countless tourists, biologists and professional wildlife photographers, was hit and killed by a vehicle in October on a highway south of Jackson, Wyoming. Park officials used wildlife tags to confirm the relationship between the two bears. Grizzly No. 1058 had been seen occasionally in the park since he was weened in 2022, but no sightings of him had been reported this spring. After he was hit by the vehicle, he made his way to a patch of willows, where he died.Park officials said Tuesday he may have been dead for several days before his body was found.At 28 years old, No. 399 was the oldest known reproducing female grizzly in the Yellowstone ecosystem. Each spring, wildlife enthusiasts eagerly awaited her emergence from her den to see how many cubs she had birthed over the winter — then quickly shared the news online. The bear had 18 known cubs in eight litters over the years, including the litter of four in 2020. She stood around 7 feet (2.1 meters) tall and weighed about 400 pounds (180 kilograms).Named for the identity tag attached to her ear by researchers, the grizzly was often seen near roads in Grand Teton, drawing crowds and creating traffic jams.The driver who struck and killed No. 399 was not speeding, and the bear’s death was ruled an accident.

Although we can’t get inside those very fancy locked doors, there’s still plenty of 24/7 election coverage for who will be the next Pope. For centuries, Catholics have flocked to Vatican City to wait for a new pope outside the Sistine Chapel. The Michelangelo-decorated chapel has been the site of papal conclaves since 1492. Cardinals have been burning their ballots for even longer, since 1417. But the different-colored smoke is much more recent, added to the hoopla in 1914 with the election of Pope Benedict XV. Black smoke means No Pope, while white smoke indicates New Pope. And now, there is yet another technological innovation, with a Smoke Cam streaming on YouTube.\\nThat’s right, screw off bald-eagle cam in Big Bear, there’s a new weird thing to put on a TV at a party. The big highlight of the smoke cam thus far?

David Muir will host ABC’s World News Tonight at the Vatican. Also on ABC, Good Morning America and GMA3 will have daily pope blasts in the morning.\\nCBS News is covering the conclave as well, streaming the oath of secrecy Wednesday morning. One commentator joked that the cardinals were “rawdogging it” (i.e., existing without devices) inside the conclave.

She had also tried to end her life twice before, the inquest heard.However at the end of 2022 she upped her intake of recreational drugs including ketamine, which lost her friends and left her feeling isolated.In April 2023 she and partner Simon Mortlock, father to twins born in 2012, separated and she moved to a flat in Thornton Heath, south London, which she found difficult.Her ketamine use led to bladder and bowel problems which she told her family had caused her pain.\\xa0Assistant coroner Laura Stephenson read from statements from family members including one from Miss Neame's mum Marina Neame saying: 'She had difficulty with finances and she had reluctantly moved to Thornton Heath. Interior designer Emma Neame, 38, died after becoming reliant on ketamine to help her cope with anxiety 'She was co-parenting and felt lonely at times.'I was aware that Emma took recreational drugs and as of the end of 2022 she had been using drugs more.'She had explained that she had given up on her relationship with her former partner and she was using drugs more to deal with her loneliness and depression, and her relationship had broken down with friends.'She wanted to return home to Kent but it was difficult because of the situation with her children.'Miss Neame attended Simon Langton Girls' Grammar School in Canterbury and trained in interior design at Kensington and Chelsea College.She had been suffering from bulimia for three years and had started attending an eating disorders clinic, the court heard.She took herself to a drug walk in clinic to try and get help for her substance abuse problems.Miss Neame then visited her mother in France in February 2024 and she said she felt things were looking up. She had been a talented interior designer for several businesses and then set up her own company, Emma Neame Interiors, in 2021. Her mother said: 'When we had seen her in France she left positive and grateful.'She was a successful interior designer and she was extremely proud of her children, a loving mother.'She was an intelligent, beautiful young woman who we were very proud of.'On March 12, 2024, the pair spoke on the phone and Miss Neame said she was feeling unwell with a sore throat and temperature.'She was looking forward to starting her latest design project,' she added.Miss Neame's maternal grandmother also gave a statement to the court.Mary Towndrow said: 'She suffered from anxiety and bulimia.'She had recreationally used drugs which had developed into a ketamine reliance or addiction.'She had high levels of stress and she had difficulty coping with the pressures of daily life.' An inquest heard Miss Neame found life difficult after her separation with her partner Simon Mortlock in 2023 Miss Neame had stayed with her the week before she died.Ms Towndrow added: 'Her physical health was deteriorating. She had problems with her bladder and bowel which were causing her pain.'Her interior design business was running into difficulty in terms of debt. She was overwhelmed.'Her former partner, Simon Mortlock, said he had known Miss Neame for 18 years.He said he had spoken to her by phone with the last call at around 5pm on March 12, 2024.The following morning he tried to reach her by phone but there was no answer, so he went to her home at about midday.The door was open and he saw drugs on the side of the kitchen counter, but couldn't see Miss Neame.He thought she may have gone to A&E so went to local hospitals but they had no record of her.When he returned to the property he saw Miss Neame had hanged herself in the garden. Her mother said Emma was 'a successful interior designer and she was extremely proud of her children, a loving mother He attempted CPR but she was already dead.His statement said: 'She appeared to be taking more recreational drugs.'She had become isolated and it appeared to be linked to her drug use.'I did not see this coming at the time.'The court heard how Miss Neame had made two previous attempts on her life in 2008 or 2009 and January 2023, but both were thought to be cries for help.During the most recent in January 2023 she took alcohol, cocaine and then an overdose, but felt immediately regretful and called an ambulance, with a friend saying: 'She really scared herself.'However she had been referred to South London and Maudsley mental health services and was engaging with them, having had a consultation in May 2023.A toxicology report found she had drunk alcohol and taken ketamine and cocaine prior to her death.She also had Alprazolam, more commonly known as Xanax, in her system, which is prescribed to treat anxiety.Ketamine has been used to treat depression and anxiety but it is not a licensed treatment the effects of taking it long term are unknown. Ms Neame, 38, had struggled with her mental health from the age of 17, with bouts of depression and anxiety Some of those who have undergone managed ketamine treatment have suffered worsening depression and suicidal thoughts and it is also known to cause bladder damage in those who take it illegally.Common symptoms are lower abdominal pain, pain passing urine, and needing to pass urine more often.Summing up, assistant coroner Ms Stephenson recorded a narrative verdict.She said she wasn't confident recording a verdict of suicide because Miss Neame's intentions weren't clear - there was no note and after previous overdoses she had immediately regretted her actions.She also said ketamine could have hallucinogenic effects with others having been accidentally strangled or suspended after having taken the drug.She said: 'She was a creative person, a talented interior designer and it has been a privilege to read these statements.'Emma did have a difficult time with substance use, including ketamine and cocaine.'Emma had shared that she had been taking ketamine and also using Xanax to cope with her issues, in particular her loneliness at that time, but her mother said she left feeling more positive about her future and she was speaking to a drug team. 'I find it is likely that the substances I have referred to, particularly ketamine, would have significantly impaired her thinking and I'm not satisfied Emma wanted to take her own life at that time.'She died by suspension at a time when she was experiencing the effects of ketamine and cocaine.'\", 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Interior designer dies by suicide after ketamine addiction\\nENTITIES: Emma Neame, Simon Mortlock, South London Coroner's Court, Marina Neame\\nEVENT: Interior designer Emma Neame died by hanging after struggling with ketamine addiction and mental health issues following a relationship breakup; the coroner recorded a narrative verdict due to uncertainty about her intent.\\nCONTEXT: Ketamine use can lead to mental health issues and accidental deaths.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 53922, 'sourceId': 12816, 'url': 'https://www.foxsports.com.au/football/worst-manchester-united-team-in-premier-league-history-on-the-verge-of-european-glory/news-story/389b4686bad25799418f248504e6c7a4', 'title': '‘Worst’ Man Utd team in Premier League history on the verge of European glory', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T22:10:00.000Z', 'content': 'Ruben Amorim says nothing will change if he wins the Europa League with the “worst” Manchester United team in Premier League history.United are currently a lowly 15th in the 20-team table – and only scraped through to the last four of the Europa League after a remarkable comeback against Lyon.But they now have one foot in the final after a 3-0 semi-final first leg win against Athletic Bilbao last week ahead of Thursday’s return encounter at Old Trafford.Watch The UEFA Women’s Champions League Final LIVE on Kayo Sports | Arsenal vs Barcelona Sunday 25 May 2am AEST | New to Kayo?

Look at the massive earthquake in western democratic politics in other countries and we are seeing wild swings. I don’t think the Conservative party will ever be extinct, but what may be extinct is the old two-party system”.In the past, he added, voters swung between the two main parties, while at the moment they “seem to be split between five parties and that’s a very, very big change”.Hunt emphasised that there was a way back into power for the Conservatives, saying the party’s woes should not be exaggerated.“We’re less than a year after the heaviest defeat in our history. It’s very unlikely, having kicked us out, voters are going to come running back to the Conservatives within just a matter of months and we do need to have a period of reflection, and it is going to take a few years before people will give us another look,” he said.The former chancellor George Osborne also weighed in on the Conservative party’s fortunes on Wednesday, saying the party was making a mistake focusing on culture wars and trying to ape Reform. He told LBC: “If we spoke a little bit less about transgender toilets and a bit more about taxes, then we might be on to something. No Conservative opposition in my lifetime has got back without winning back credibility on the economy and making that the central offer at the election.”He suggested he would struggle to vote for the Conservative party in alliance with Nigel Farage, and said: “I don’t personally think chasing Nigel Farage’s tail is going to work. And if you want Nigel Farage, why not have Nigel Farage? I think the 10-year trend inside the Conservative movement of trying to copy the Brexit party or the Ukip party or now the Reform party has not really worked.”The Conservatives attempted to get on the front foot against Reform on Tuesday by publishing a proposed law setting out a plan to deport all people who enter the country by illegal routes, and accused Labour and Reform of being “complicit in the trade of empty slogans”. It would involve disapplying the Human Rights Act from all immigration-related matters, which the party says is necessary to stop foreign nationals “exploiting” the courts.A Labour source said the Tories had 14 years in office to enact any of the “rehashed and half-baked” policies in their bill, and instead had left the asylum system in a “chaotic mess”.', 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Tories face extinction amid Reform UK surge\\nENTITIES: Jeremy Hunt, Conservatives, Reform UK, Kemi Badenoch, William Hague, Nigel Farage, George Osborne, Labour, Liberal Democrats, Greens\\nEVENT: Former Chancellor Jeremy Hunt warns of a potential 'massive earthquake' in politics that could lead to the extinction of the Conservative party due to the rise of Reform UK and fracturing of the two-party system.

This can minimise sweat during the day, which helps avoid dehydration, which can further impact health.”Create a consistent, structured sleep routineDr Grant says: “During spring, women can also find trouble maintaining a regular sleeping schedule, especially as clocks change and temperatures rise in the evenings. This is particularly challenging as poor sleep has a knock-on effect on symptoms, causing more mood swings while increasing the intensity of hot flashes or night sweats.“Therefore, I suggest women aim to create a more structured approach to sleep, aiming to go to bed at the same time each night, utilising a fan to combat warmth and avoiding any blue light for up to sixty minutes before bedtime. Over time, this can help regulate our body’s routine, making it much easier to fall asleep and helping to minimise mood swings and temperature changes.”Try and exercise if possible“When it comes to managing menopause symptoms, exercise is incredibly effective”, shared Dr Grant.“This is because during menopause, women’s risk of conditions such as heart disease rises. Exercise is a great way to combat this, as it boosts cardiovascular fitness by strengthening the heart and lowering blood pressure.“Furthermore, exercising during menopause can improve bone density, help improve mood and manage weight. As menopause can also increase muscle loss, engaging in regular strength training is a great way to avoid long-term effects and maintain well-being, post menopause.”Dr Grant also recommends a range of yoga and pilates routines to boost flexibility and maintain mobility.Manage your dietDr Grant says: “Managing menopause symptoms can often come down to dietary choices, as the right foods can provide a wealth of vital nutrients, helping reduce the overall intensity of symptoms.“Overall, I suggest incorporating a mix of leafy greens, healthy fats (fish, avocado, nuts), lean proteins (poultry, eggs), and fibre-rich foods (apples, pears, broccoli). By maintaining a well-balanced diet, women can reduce symptoms of brain fog while supporting their overall well-being.”Understand common triggers and avoid them if possibleUnderstanding potential triggers can help women make choices that put their health first, according to Dr Grant.“During spring, keeping stress levels at a minimum is crucial, as heightened stress can elevate menopause symptoms, further impacting daily life. Other common menopause triggers include alcohol, smoking, spicy foods and caffeine. In my opinion, if women can limit these triggers and prioritise healthier approaches to diet, sleep and exercise, spring can become a lot easier to manage.”', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: GP tips: Managing menopause symptoms during spring\\nENTITIES: Dr Donald Grant\\nEVENT: GP Dr. Grant recommends dietary changes, sleep routines, exercise, and trigger avoidance to manage menopause symptoms exacerbated by spring weather.\\nCONTEXT: Lifestyle changes can mitigate menopause symptoms during spring.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 53443, 'sourceId': 12762, 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/may/08/australias-best-small-museums-celebrating-apples-bottles-country-music-dinosaurs', 'title': 'Australia’s best small museums: celebrating apples, bottles, country music, dinosaurs …', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T15:00:52.000Z', 'content': 'In the small country town of Tingha in northern New South Wales sits a supermarket seemingly frozen in time: the Wing Hing Long and Company Store. Its shelves are lined with old products – canned food from the 90s, shoes from bygone eras, boxes of soap with retro graphics and bottles of spray-on starch. “It’s almost like you’re stepping back in history,” says artist Simone Rosenbauer. “It’s so amazing!”None of the products are for sale: this supermarket, established by storekeeper Ah Lin in 1881 to service the region’s tin-mining boom, is now a living museum – conserved by the local council after it closed in 1998 after nearly 120 years of business.Wing Hing Long & Co in Tingha, New South Wales. Photograph: Simone RosenbauerThe Wing Hing Long and Company Store is one of 41 rural museums Rosenbauer documented as part of her ambitious project Small Museum, which took her across every state and territory photographing community-run museums and interviewing the people behind them.From the Surf World Museum in the Victorian town of Torquay to the Telegraph Station museum in Alice Springs, the project was a quest to highlight the “significant stories and archives that often don’t make it into the big-city museums,” says Rosenbauer. It was also a way to explore and highlight the important intergenerational, social and cultural role these spaces play in their communities.The Mount Isa Underground Museum in Queensland. Photograph: Simone RosenbauerThe genesis of the project was a road trip in 2003, when Rosenbauer was a university exchange student from Germany. Along the way she “bumped into a few small museums” and noticed a stark contrast with Germany’s highly regulated institutions. “I was fascinated by these spaces and how much love, passion and creativity people put into [them],” she says.\\nSign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning\\nThese museums, alongside other experiences on the road, shifted Rosenbauer’s understanding of Australia from the tourist stereotype of “hot and all beach” towards a more nuanced portrait of diverse landscapes and communities.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionThen, in 2007, after immigrating to Australia, Rosenbauer found herself grappling with the national identity, and thinking once again about the small museums she had encountered on her travels. She decided to visit as many as she could – and after two years of research and carefully planning a route that sometimes required driving hundreds of kilometres between museums – as well as a timetable that would allow her to have the best natural light in each place – she set off.The caretakers are ‘part of the collection because they hold stories like the objects do’ … The School of Mines, in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. Photograph: Simone RosenbauerThroughout her travels, Rosenbauer captured more than 3,000 film images of Australia’s idiosyncratic small museums, such as the Apple and Heritage Museum in Tasmania’s Huonville, which houses a revolving display of 300 apple varieties on carefully hand-labelled shelves – depending on what’s in season. She visited museums run by historical societies; living museums that recreate historical settings; museums based on themes such as dinosaurs, golf, beetles and country music; and museums housed in buildings with long histories – former jails, tea rooms, preschools and mines, as well as a boarding house where Aboriginal children of the Stolen Generations were taken to live.From more lighthearted museums to those rooted in a dark colonial past, Rosenbauer took the same approach to documentation, devised to mirror how museums categorise and itemise their collections: she photographed the building, the people who worked there, the collection as a whole, individual objects on a white background, and still life arrangements.Land of the Beardies History House, in Glen Innes, New South Wales. Photograph: Simone RosenbauerRosenbauer also interviewed the staff, most of whom were volunteers, aiming to capture their wealth of knowledge. “To me, these caretakers were part of the collection because they hold stories like the objects do,” she says. She asked each of them the same questions: “What is the history of the building? What is your connection to the community and where did your ancestors come from? Can you tell us about this collection? How does your collection fit into the history of Australia?”So: what did she learn about being Australian? “I wouldn’t be able to pin it down,” she says. “Being Australian is very diverse.”Rosenbauer finished photography for Small Museum in 2010 and the project has had a busy life in the intervening decade-and-a-half, including exhibitions at New York’s Laurence Miller gallery and the Paris Photo Fair. In Australia, however, interest has lagged. “Nothing really happened until 2022,” says the artist; then the National Library acquired a number of photographs for their permanent collection.Since then “there has been a new momentum,” Rosenbauer says: in 2024, Maitland Regional Art Gallery exhibited more than 100 photographs from the Small Museum project; and this month, her long-planned book – featuring the photographs and interviews – is finally being published by London’s GOST Books.Tamworth Historical Society, Tamworth, New South Wales. Photograph: Simone RosenbauerRosenbauer believes the project’s significance will only grow over time. “When you look at this project in 40, 50 or 100 years, it will have a historical value because a lot of these small museums face challenges and, in the future, many will disappear along with their significant stories, archives, collections and objects.”Some already have. A notable loss, Rosenbauer says, is the Banking and Currency Museum in Kadina, South Australia, which was housed in an old bank. Founded and run by writer and publisher Michael P. Vort-Ronald, it had a “very rich collection”, says the artist. Unfortunately, no one could be found to take over the collection as a whole, so it was sold off in parts.Dow’s Pharmacy Museum, Chiltern, Victoria. ‘A lot of these small museums face challenges and, in the future, many will disappear.’ Photograph: Simone RosenbauerRosenbauer’s book and images, then, stand as a form of preservation, safeguarding these at-risk places by documenting some of their stories and objects. At the same time, the carefully composed images, with their gentle light and intriguing subject matter, serve as an invitation to visit and appreciate the small museums that still stand.For Rosenbauer, Small Museum also has another function: “the project is a gift I want to give back to Australia because I’m very happy to live here,” she says. “These small museums are something I want to share with everyone.”\\nSmall Museum is out in May through GOST Books.', 'location': 'AUS', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Australia's small museums celebrated in photography project\\nENTITIES: Simone Rosenbauer, Wing Hing Long and Company Store, Small Museum project, National Library, GOST Books\\nEVENT: Artist Simone Rosenbauer documented 41 rural museums across Australia, highlighting their significance and the stories they hold, culminating in a book publication.\\nCONTEXT: Small museums in Australia face challenges and may disappear.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 52588, 'sourceId': 12321, 'url': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/republican-jefferson-griffin-concedes-nc-supreme-court-race-rcna205358', 'title': 'Republican Jefferson Griffin concedes North Carolina Supreme Court race', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T15:01:51.000Z', 'content': 'Republican Jefferson Griffin conceded the North Carolina Supreme Court race Wednesday to Democratic incumbent Allison Riggs, bringing an end to the last unresolved contest from the 2024 election that dragged on for months after a barrage of lawsuits.The announcement came two days after a federal judge ruled against Griffin\\'s legal challenge to tens of thousands of ballots and ordered the North Carolina State Board of Elections to certify Riggs\\' 734-vote victory. The ruling from U.S. District Judge Richard Myers, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, effectively put an end to all ongoing litigation and provided Griffin with seven days to appeal. Instead, Griffin, chose to end his legal efforts six months after the final votes had been cast in November\\'s election. “While I do not fully agree with the District Court’s analysis, I respect the court’s holding — just as I have respected every judicial tribunal that has heard this case,” Griffin said in a statement Wednesday morning. “I will not appeal the court’s decision.”Riggs said in a statement: \"After millions of dollars spent, more than 68,000 voters at risk of losing their votes, thousands of volunteers mobilized, hundreds of legal documents filed, and immeasurable damage done to our democracy, I’m glad the will of the voters was finally heard, six months and two days after Election Day.\"Democratic Justice Allison Riggs will hang on to her seat on the North Carolina Supreme Court.Makiya Seminera / AP fileRiggs, who was appointed to the state Supreme Court in 2023, emerged after Election Day narrowly ahead of Griffin, a state appeals court judge.\\xa0A full machine recount and a partial hand recount both showed Riggs leading Griffin by 734 votes out of 5.5 million ballots cast.But Griffin quickly filed hundreds of legal challenges, backed by the North Carolina Republican Party, in all of the state\\'s 100 counties, alleging that more than 65,000 people had voted illegally.\\xa0Those claims focused on three categories of voters: voters who Griffin’s lawyers claimed didn’t have driver’s licenses or Social Security numbers on file in their registration records, overseas voters who haven’t lived in North Carolina and overseas voters who failed to provide photo identification with their ballots.Those challenges remained tied up in both federal and state courts — including the North Carolina Supreme Court — as a series of nuanced rulings evaluated specific and complex elements related to Griffin’s allegations. Griffin and Riggs recused themselves from the matter when the issue came before the courts they serve on.The latest, and now final, ruling came Monday when Myers, the federal judge, ruled that the remaining disputed ballots in the contest must be included in the final tally, effectively upholding Riggs’ victory.Myers wrote that it would be unconstitutional to toss tens of thousands of ballots that Griffin claimed were ineligible months after they were cast.“You establish the rules before the game. You don’t change them after the game is done,” Myers wrote in his 68-page order.Riggs\\' victory will maintain the current 5-2 split on the state Supreme Court, where Republicans have the majority. Myers’ ruling followed a controversial decision by the North Carolina Supreme Court that allowed election officials to move forward with a period for thousands of military and overseas voters to “cure” their ballots. Myers had earlier blocked that order temporarily to give himself time to review the broader case. That state Supreme Court decision had found that about 60,000 of the votes in question cannot be thrown out, but that others could be if minor errors were not fixed, meaning those voters would be required to prove their eligibility to election officials. The invalidation of even a small number of those ballots could have changed the outcome of the election.The saga emerged as a flashpoint over whether ballots could be tossed long after voters had cast them, an effort that Griffin’s critics warned could be replicated in future attempts to overturn close races.Those critics noted that Griffin’s arguments contradicted several long-held precedents in election law, including the notion that the rules of an election must be set before voting occurs. “This is a righteous victory for democracy and a clear defeat of political gamesmanship,” Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said a statement following Griffin\\'s concession. “For 200 days, Republicans in North Carolina sought to overturn the will of the people, hijack a state Supreme Court seat, and systematically undermine basic faith in our elections.” The DNC had joined in some of the legal efforts to fight Griffin’s challenges.Griffin, in his statement, hit back against some of the Democrats\\' claims, saying that “this eﬀort has always been about upholding the rule of law and making sure that every legal vote in an election is counted.”The State Board of Elections will now move to formally certify the race\\'s results. State Republicans recently took control of the board after a battle in the courts, which further amplified Democrats\\' worries over whether the Supreme Court race results would be overturned.In a 3-2 vote that occurred just hours after Griffin conceded, the new GOP majority on the board voted to replace the group\\'s executive director, Karen Brinson Bell, with Sam Hayes, an attorney who has worked for state Republicans for years.Republicans were able to take over the board after the GOP-controlled Legislature passed a bill last year that shifted the authority to appoint members to the panel from the governor, who is a Democrat in North Carolina, to the auditor, an office Republicans won in the 2024 election. GOP lawmakers successfully overrode a veto from the governor before they lost their supermajority in the Legislature. After months of litigation, the North Carolina Court of Appeals said last week that the law could stand, allowing Republican state Auditor Dave Boliek to name a new board.Adam EdelmanAdam Edelman is a politics reporter for NBC News.', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Griffin concedes North Carolina Supreme Court race\\nENTITIES: Jefferson Griffin, Allison Riggs, North Carolina, Republican Party, Democratic National Committee, Karen Brinson Bell, Sam Hayes, Dave Boliek\\nEVENT: Republican Jefferson Griffin conceded the North Carolina Supreme Court race to Democratic incumbent Allison Riggs after a federal judge ruled against Griffin's legal challenge to tens of thousands of ballots.

They were charged on April 15.Magistrate Njeri Thuku, sitting at the court in Kenya’s main airport on Wednesday, said in her ruling that despite the teenagers telling the court they were naïve and collecting the ants as a hobby, the particular species of ants they collected is valuable and they had thousands of them — not just a few.The Kenya Wildlife Service had said the teenagers were involved in trafficking the ants to markets in Europe and Asia, and that the species included messor cephalotes, a distinctive, large and red-colored harvester ant native to East Africa.“This is beyond a hobby. Indeed, there is a biting shortage of messor cepholates online,” Thuku said in her ruling.Article continues below this adThe teenagers\\' lawyer, Halima Nyakinyua, described the sentencing as “fair” and said her clients would not appeal.“When the statutes prescribe a specific minimum amount, the court cannot go lower than that. So, even if we went to the court of appeal, the court is not going to revise that,\" she said.The illegal export of the ants “not only undermines Kenya’s sovereign rights over its biodiversity but also deprives local communities and research institutions of potential ecological and economic benefits,” KWS said in a statement.In a separate but related case, two other men charged after they were found with 400 ants were also fined $7,700 each with an option of serving 12 months in prison.Article continues below this adDuh Hung Nguyen, a Vietnamese national, told the court that he was sent to pick up the ants and arrived at Kenya\\'s main airport where he met his contact person, Dennis Ng\\'ang\\'a, and together they travelled to meet the locals who sell the ants.Ng\\'ang\\'a, who is from Kenya, had said he didn\\'t know it was illegal because ants are sold and eaten locally.Magistrate Thuku during the ruling described Ng\\'ang\\'a and Nguyen\\'s meet-up as “part of an elaborate scheme.”Experts in Kenya have in recent days warned of an emerging trend to traffic lesser-known wildlife species.Article continues below this adEntomologist Shadrack Muya, a senior lecturer at Kenya\\'s Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, told The Associated Press that garden ants are important for aerating soils, enhancing soil fertility and dispersing seeds.“Ants play a very important role in the environment and their disturbance, which is also their removal, will lead to disruption of the ecosystem,” he said.Muya warned against taking ants from their natural habitats, saying they were unlikely to survive if not supported to adapt to their new environment.Article continues below this ad“Survival in the new environment will depend on the interventions that are likely to take place.

Theatre, comedy and music shows were put on in a variety of sheds and streamed live to an audience online. The digital initiative proved as popular as it was canny and returned the following year. Now, the Shedinburgh festival is set to be resurrected this summer for a series of in-person, one-off performances in a new 100-seat venue in Edinburgh.Jayde Adams, Mark Watson and Ivo Graham are among the standups taking part, along with fringe favourites Sh!t Theatre, the Guilty Feminist host Deborah Frances-White, Marlow and Moss (the composing duo behind hit musical Six) and recent Olivier award-winner Maimuna Memon. There will be Shed Shows (intimate “unplugged” versions of hit fringe productions from the past), Shed Originals (using previously unseen scripts by emerging writers) and ShedX Talks (free panels and Q&As), as well as late-night music events. The venue will be open during the day as a cafe and bar. Tickets including pay-what-you-can options will be released later this month when the full “shed-ule” is announced as well as further details about the venue including its location.Taking a show to Edinburgh is a financially risky endeavour for performers who are often required to pay the venue a minimum guarantee. Shedinburgh will instead be giving a guaranteed fee to each act as well as covering their travel and accommodation expenses.Moody, whose Edinburgh hits include Fleabag and Baby Reindeer, said: “In recent years it has become more challenging than ever to bring a show to the festival and for artists and audiences it feels increasingly inaccessible. Shedinburgh is our attempt to level the playing field; it’s our love letter to the fringe, and something that we hope sits in conversation with the many other brilliant initiatives working to ensure the festival remains a launchpad for the next generation of gamechanging artists.”Applications will soon open for Shedinburgh’s Shedload of Future Fund, which will distribute money raised from the 2020 and 2021 digital seasons. The fund will award three £5,000 grants to artists making their Edinburgh fringe debut this summer.Watson said “it’s getting harder and harder for emerging artists to survive [in Edinburgh] or even take the risk of going in the first place. There needs to be a fresh approach to the way the festival works for performers, and that’s what Shedinburgh is offering.” Adams, who will be performing a show that is “more theatrical, more personal and unlike anything I’ve done before”, said Shedinburgh would offer a space that is “intimate, raw and open to risk”.', 'location': 'GBR', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Shedinburgh Festival Returns to Edinburgh Fringe\\nENTITIES: Francesca Moody, Gary McNair, Jayde Adams, Mark Watson, Ivo Graham, Sh!t Theatre, Deborah Frances-White, Marlow and Moss, Maimuna Memon\\nEVENT: Shedinburgh festival, created during the pandemic, is returning to the Edinburgh Fringe with a new 100-seat venue, offering guaranteed fees and covering expenses for performers.\\nCONTEXT: Shedinburgh festival returns to Edinburgh Fringe with venue.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 49517, 'sourceId': 12511, 'url': 'https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366623774/Girls-more-concerned-about-AI-bias-than-boys', 'title': 'Girls more concerned about AI bias than boys', 'publishDate': '2025-05-08T05:45:00.000Z', 'content': \"deagreez - stock.adobe.com\\nBy\\nClare McDonald,\\nBusiness Editor\\nPublished: 08 May 2025 10:45\\nThe areas of artificial intelligence (AI) young people are interested in varies between genders, according to research by InnovateHer.\\nThe social enterprise asked more than a thousand students between the ages of 12 and 17 their opinions on AI, and found more boys than girls interested in the subject – 69% and 54% respectively – but also differing areas of focus, with girls worried about AI bias and boys concerned about cyber security.\\n“While it’s encouraging to see such interest [in AI] from both sides, these differences risk reinforcing long-standing stereotypes,” said Chelsea Slater, co-founder and CEO of InnovateHer. “We believe these patterns stem from the messages young people receive from an early age about careers, tech and who belongs in those spaces.\\n“At InnovateHer, we’re working to challenge those narratives and ensure all young people can see themselves in the future of AI.”\\nThe areas of AI students were interested in depended on their gender – girls are predominantly concerned with ethics, policy and data analysis, while boys’ main area of focus was on on machine learning, robotics and AI development.\\nThis divide between male and female participants in the technology sector is not a new thing, and men are more likely than women to pursue technology careers for a variety of reasons – in fact, women and young girls feel they are sometimes actively discouraged from joining the sector, and misconceptions about the skill sets needed for a tech role leave women feeling the sector isn’t for them.\\nThere are also concerns in the tech sector about automation replacing a large number of women’s jobs, and while many argue it will create as many as it replaces, only 29% of girls believed AI would create more jobs in the future, compared with 53% of boys.\\nAlmost 70% of girls actually think AI will make it harder for women to pursue technology careers, partly because of the bias it may create in the hiring process, especially because of the lack of role models already in the tech sector.\\nA lack of role models is often cited as a reason why girls avoid the tech sector, but it also means that the fewer women involved in the technology sector, the fewer women will be part of the decision-making processes surrounding AI, and the more likely it is these technologies will be built with biases.\\nA large number of girls – some 79% – think there should be more stringent regulations surrounding AI, specifically to prevent worsening AI bias, with 71% expressing concerns about AI reinforcing the gender bias that already exists in many elements of decision-making in the tech workplace.\\nBoys, on the other hand, are less concerned about bias and more concerned about regulating AI to bolster cyber security and address privacy risks.\\nBut there are other concerns among girls when it comes to AI.

All three have the city’s traditional sego lily design, respectively imposed over a pride flag, a trans flag and a Juneteenth commemoration flag.“Our city flags are powerful symbols representing Salt Lake City’s values,” said Mendenhall in a press release. “I want all Salt Lakers to look up at these flags and be reminded that we value diversity, equity and inclusion – leaving no doubt that we are united as a city and people, moving forward together.”The new flags were a direct reaction to Utah’s House Bill 77, which narrowed the list of allowable flags to the state flag, the US flag, Olympic and Paralympic flags, official college flags or tribal flags, a city or county flag and military flags. State and local governments could be fined $500 a day for flying other unofficial flags.The newly adopted city flags are displayed at the Salt Lake city and county building. Photograph: Melissa Majchrzak/APIdaho’s House Bill 96 restricted flags to a list including the US flag, the POW/MIA flag, the official flags of Idaho colleges, universities and public schools, the official flags of military branches and the Idaho state flag. The pride flag has flown over Boise’s city hall for years. Boise mayor Lauren McLean issued a proclamation in response, retroactively making the pride flag an official city flag.Rolling back LGBTQ+ rights has been a fixation for the Trump administration, and for conservative legislatures across the country. The US supreme court recently upheld Trump’s ban on trans military members. The president has penned executive orders targeting trans athletes and imposing strict gender definitions.Wyoming, one of the US’s reddest states, had more trans-focused bills than trans athletes this year. Iowa pushed to remove gender identity from the state’s civil rights code. More than a dozen other states are considering flag measures similar to those in Utah and Idaho.Boise’s city council voted 5-1 in favor of the proclamation, with council member Meredith Stead as an affirmative vote.“Removing the flag now after years of flying it proudly would not be a neutral act,” said Stead. “It would signal a retreat from values we’ve long upheld and send a disheartening message to those who have found affirmation and belonging through its presence at city hall.”', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Cities adopt pride flags to skirt bans\\nENTITIES: Salt Lake City, Boise, Erin Mendenhall, Lauren McLean, Utah, Idaho\\nEVENT: Salt Lake City and Boise adopted pride flags as official city flags to bypass state bans on unofficial flags on government property.\\nCONTEXT: Cities circumvent Republican bans on pride flags by adopting them as official city flags.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 50449, 'sourceId': 12606, 'url': 'https://theweek.com/culture-life/food-drink/dream-dinner-ali-slagle-recipes-easy-cookbook', 'title': \"One great cookbook: 'I Dream of Dinner (so you don't have to)'\", 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T06:00:40.000Z', 'content': 'Every cookbook aims to inspire.

Officers sedated Karma, who was later destroyed.All three girls – Hewitt’s daughters aged eight and four and their 11-year-old friend - needed hospital treatment for bite and puncture wounds.The eight-year-old sustained the most ‘significant’ injuries, including a deep wound down to the bone on her upper right arm.Hewitt, 42, is understood to have registered the pet under a new law brought in weeks earlier that required them to be registered - but also stated they must be kept securely.The semi-permanent makeup artist appeared in court yesterday where she was handed an eight-month jail term, suspended for 18 months, after admitting being in charge of a dog dangerously out of control causing injury.Judge Anthony Bate heard the dog had belonged to an ex-partner of Hewitt who left it with her. XL bully Karma mauled three girls aged four, eight and 11 after reacting 'aggressively' to a knock at the front door Owner Victoria Hewitt, 42, was left the dog by a former partner. She admitted being in charge of a dog dangerously out of control causing injury She took steps to manage the risk it posed, including installing a pen and stairgates. Karma was also muzzled when out on walks and kept in a different room when visitors called by.But Judge Bate said while the precautions were ‘well intended’, they were limited and ‘inadequate’, allowing the powerful pet to cause the terrible injuries.Many of the photos on Hewitt’s Facebook page show Karma, including one where she is on a bed with a small child.An image posted on February 2 last year – weeks before the attack – shows Karma and two younger dogs with the caption ‘My triple trouble pups’.The horrific incident took place at Hewitt’s home in Costessey, Norfolk, on March 7 last year, Norwich Crown Court was told.Prosecutor Chris Youell said Karma had never reacted aggressively before but when someone knocked at the door she reacted in a ‘very aggressive and violent way’.The pet ‘went’ for the eight-year-old first, with Hewitt leaping on it and trying to prize its jaws off the girl.She took the ham from the fridge in the hope it would distract the bitch but this didn’t work and it continued ‘dragging’ and ‘biting’ the child. What is the law on XL Bullies?\\xa0 Since February 1 last year, it has been a criminal offence to own an XL bully dog in England and Wales without a certificate.\\xa0To qualify for an exemption certificate, owners had to prove their XL bully was neutered by June 30.If the pup was less than a year old by January 31, they must have been neutered by the end of 2024, and evidence of this provided.As well as neutering their animals, XL bully owners seeking an exemption must also pay an application fee, hold active public liability insurance for their pets and ensure the dogs are microchipped.\\xa0People with dangerously out of control dogs can be jailed for 14 years and banned from owning animals. Their their pets can also be put down. Karma then switched her attention to the other two girls, who had been cowering on the sofa ‘screaming’, and was ‘trying to bite them’.Both were bitten as they ran to a door to escape before Hewitt managed to wrestle them free.The eight-year-old girl used the distraction to flee upstairs to her two-year-old brother, who was in his cot.Hewitt’s neighbour arrived after hearing the screams and dragged the dog to the floor as it snapped at her.They ‘held her on the floor’ and ‘screamed’ at the others to get out. Police arrived within minutes and Hewitt pleaded with them to ‘shoot the dog’ before they sedated the pet and took her away.The court was told that all three children have received counselling and therapy to help them come to terms with the horrifying incident.Rob Pollington, defending, said his client was ‘extremely remorseful for what has occurred’.No punishment meted out by the court could ‘teach the level of pain and suffering that she herself has put herself through’.Judge Bate, who praised the skill of surgeons who treated the children, accepted Hewitt’s remorse was ‘profound and genuine’.He also ordered her to carry out a 20-day Rehabilitation Activity Requirement, in which an offender takes part in activities designed to address the behaviour that contributed to the crime and attend supervision appointments with a probation officer.Detective Constable Natalie Purcell, of Norfolk Police, said: ‘This was a distressing incident where a woman and three children were injured by an XL bully. Due to the immediate risk posed to emergency services and the public, the dog was destroyed at the scene.‘The dog was correctly registered and insured. However, we'd like to remind all dog owners it is against the law to keep an XL bully dog without a Certificate of Exemption.‘Registered dogs must also be housed securely, neutered and kept on a lead and muzzled in public.’ The court was told that Hewitt, who received a suspended jail term, was deeply remorseful for this incident and no punishment could 'teach the level of pain and suffering that she herself has put herself through' Karma was sedated by police when they arrived at the house and was later destroyed The former Conservative government introduced new restrictions on ownership of XL bully dogs following attacks including this one captured on CCTV in Birmingham in September 2023 New laws restricting the breeding and sale of XL bullies were introduced on December 31, 2023, following a series of horrific incidents in which owners and innocent bystanders were maimed for life or killed by the powerful pets.In February last year, it became illegal to own a dog of this type unless registered before the deadline.

The agreement with Britain, which has been three years in the making, is one of several India is negotiating, including with the US and EU. It illustrates its appeal as a rising global power – the world’s most populous country and its fastest-growing major economy, which is also the fifth (and on course to be third) largest overall. In contrast, the military operations targeting Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir demonstrate how India continues to be bogged down by instabilities in its neighbourhood and held hostage to its history.India’s military actions are in response to a terrorist attack last month in which 26 tourists were killed in Indian-administered Kashmir. The name of the military operation – Sindoor – refers to a symbol of marriage, alluding to the women who lost their husbands in the attack that selectively targeted Hindu men. New Delhi says it is trying to ensure the conflict remains limited between the nuclear-armed neighbours. It says its operations have targeted terrorist infrastructure rather than military facilities, although civilian casualties have been reported, and referred to its military action as a “precision strike” that has been “focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature”.Whether it remains “non-escalatory” will depend on Pakistan’s response. The situation remains precarious amid the risk of accidental escalation, limited external pressure and both sides adopting an assertive military posture to appease their domestic political constituencies and hyper-nationalist foreign policies. In the past, the US played a prominent role in de-escalating tensions. But President Donald Trump nonchalantly referred to the current hostilities as a “a shame”, while stating earlier that both countries would sort it out in “one way or another”. In a world where the US sees international relations through the prism of “spheres of influence” – as reflected in Trump’s claims to Canada, Greenland and the Panama canal, while seeing the Russian invasion of Ukraine as Europe’s problem – there is clearly a limited appetite for Washington to get involved in South Asian geopolitics.India and Pakistan have fought three wars since they were established in 1947, two of them over Kashmir. The territory is vital to Pakistan’s security, with about 80% of the country’s cultivated land dependent on water from the Indus water system that traverses Kashmir – that’s why the recent decision by India to hold a longstanding water agreement in abeyance is seen as an existential threat to Pakistan. A week before the terrorist attack, Pakistan’s army chief, Asim Munir, referred to Kashmir as Pakistan’s “jugular vein”. Reports of critical mineral deposits in Kashmir have also elevated the strategic importance of the territory to India.However, at the heart of the tensions is the question of identity rooted in the scars of partition in 1947 that created the countries of India and Pakistan. The Pakistani state – and in particular the military and intelligence establishment – has derived legitimacy from maintaining a well-entrenched anti-India identity. The real source of authority in Pakistan is not the prime minister (Shehbaz Sharif) or the president (Asif Ali Zardari), but rather Munir and the head of the country’s intelligence service, the ISI (Muhammad Asim Malik). No civilian prime minister has completed a full term in the country’s 77-year history. If India-Pakistan relations were on good terms, there would be little justification for the military to have such a dominant role in Pakistani politics and the economy.On India’s part, the decision by the government of Narendra Modi to rescind the special autonomous status of Kashmir in 2019 , and divide the state into two territories that were directly ruled by New Delhi, fuelled tensions with Islamabad. New Delhi claims that doing this normalised Kashmir’s status, pointing to an increase in tourism and investment inflows and largely peaceful elections in the territory last year. However, last month’s terrorist attack and India and Pakistan’s tit-for-tat military responses show that Kashmir is far from normal. Moreover, local grievances remain as Kashmiri autonomy and identity have gradually been eroded in both Indian and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.These tensions are unlikely to subside anytime soon. Much like the Israel-Palestine conflict or tensions across the Taiwan Strait and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, they are rooted in longstanding historical faultlines and questions of national identity. Ultimately, India’s global aspirations remain held hostage to regional instabilities.\\nDr Chietigj Bajpaee is senior fellow for south Asia at the thinktank Chatham House', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: India strikes Pakistan amid trade agreement efforts\\nENTITIES: India, Pakistan, Narendra Modi, Asim Munir, ISI, Muhammad Asim Malik, Shehbaz Sharif, Asif Ali Zardari, Kashmir\\nEVENT: India launched military operations against Pakistan in response to a terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, while also pursuing trade agreements with countries like the UK.

In recent years, the festival has put more and more movies in line for the American Oscars — this year, Anora was the second Palme d’Or winner since 2019 to win Best Picture (the first was Parasite). The last movie that won both the Palme and Best Picture before Parasite was 1955’s Marty. Also a trend? For the past five festivals, indie distributor Neon has won consecutively with Parasite, Titane, Triangle of Sadness, Anatomy of a Fall, and\\xa0Anora. This year, the distributor has two chances: Titane director Julia Ducournau’s Alpha and Joachim Trier’s Worst Person in the World follow-up, Sentimental Value.\\nOn May 7, Cannes announced the “Cannes Classic” lineup, which includes a new documentary directed by Leo Lewis O’Neil about Shia LaBeouf’s free acting school. \\ufeffSlauson Rec will reportedly show LaBeouf physically harming a student, per Vanity Fair. “While my teaching methods may be unconventional for some, I am proud of the incredible accomplishments that these kids achieved,” LaBeouf said in a statement to Vanity Fair. “Together we turned a drama class into an acting company. I wish only good things for Leo and everyone who was part of The Slauson Rec Company.” LaBeouf will attend the festival.\\nElsewhere in the lineup, a spate of early 2010s heartthrobs are making their way to the Riviera. Lynne Ramsay’s Jennifer Lawrence– and Robert Pattinson–starring Die, My Love was added to the lineup on April 23, as was Kristen Stewart’s directorial debut The Chronology of Water. Current heartthrob Josh O’Connor appears twice, in both Kelly Reichardt’s art-heist film, The Mastermind, and the gay WWI romance The History of Sound opposite Paul Mescal. Plus, Tom Cruise is going to debut Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning out of competition. And American film lovers will recognize Wes Anderson’s The Phoenician Scheme, along with Richard Linklater (Nouvelle Vague) and Ari Aster (Eddington) in competition. Screening in “Un Certain Regard” will be the directorial debuts of Scarlett Johansson (Eleanor the Great) and Harris Dickinson (Urchin). The festival runs May 13–24.

'publishDate': '2025-05-08T04:38:32.000Z', 'content': 'SUQUAMISH, Wash. -- For over two decades, Suquamish tribal member Joshua George has dived into the emerald waters of the Salish Sea looking for an unusually phallic clam that’s coveted thousands of miles away.George is a geoduck diver. Pronounced “gooey-duck,” the world’s largest burrowing clam has been harvested in tidelands by George’s Indigenous ancestors in the Pacific Northwest since before Europeans arrived. In recent years it has also become a delicacy in China, with Washington state sending 90% of its geoducks there, creating a niche yet lucrative American seafood export. But the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China is now crippling an entire industry that hand-harvests geoducks, leaving Washington state divers without work, Seattle exporters without business and Chinese aficionados with fewer of these prized clams.“It’s the first time in 24 years where I don’t know when or if we’ll be going back to work or if I have to find another job or what we’re going to do,” George said.U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff-driven economic feud with China, which dates back to his first term in office, swiftly resumed in February within weeks of taking back the White House. By April, Trump had placed tariffs of at least 145% on China, which led China to retaliate with tariffs of 125% on the U.S.Top U.S. officials are set to meet with a high-level Chinese delegation this weekend in Switzerland in the first major talks between the two nations since the latest tariffs were imposed, but it is unclear where those talks will lead.Enter the geoduck, weighing about 2 pounds and so entrenched in local culture that it is the mascot for Evergreen State College in Olympia. The meaty mollusk is best described as sweet and briny, and it\\'s often sliced raw for crisp sashimi out west while China consumers prefer it chewy in stir-fries or hot pot soups. Pre-tariff costs were as high as $100 per pound in restaurants, so it’s a dish generally reserved for special occasions like Chinese New Year, or to celebrate a business gathering.Unlike other products with long-lasting shelf life and standing inventory, the trade war has had an immediate, direct effect on the delicate geoducks, which are shipped alive the same day of harvest.“The whole market, everybody just had to stop,” said Jim Boure, general manager of Suquamish Seafoods, an enterprise of the Suquamish Tribe. “We started getting phone calls from buyers saying orders are canceled.”The millions of pounds of geoducks shipped annually to China come from two main sources: wild harvests on tracts of seafloor that are split between the Washington State Department of Natural Resources and Puget Sound Treaty Indian Tribes, and tideland farms. The state’s share is auctioned to private exporters that often hire contract divers to harvest them. As of late April, Washington state divers had only pulled about half of the expected harvest from the state tracts, said Blain Reeves, an aquatic resources division manager for the state’s Department of Natural Resources. Last year, the state and tribes collectively harvested about 3.4 million pounds of wild Washington geoduck for sale. The state generated $22.4 million in revenue for their half of the clams, which went toward paying for aquatic restoration projects locally. The state doesn\\'t track how much is harvested by private farmers. “If only half the pounds that were contracted are harvested, then our revenue is halved,” Reeves said.The Suquamish operation has no orders to harvest for at the moment, but it still must keep up with the maintenance to stay ready for business if and when China comes calling. On a recent April day, George’s team made a quick trip to collect a handful of the clams for state lab testing.“When we’re doing the job, and it’s not all this other political stuff behind the scenes and everything else, we love this,” said George, adding that diving, which takes place early in the day so that the geoducks are on an airplane by evening, has allowed him to watch his kids grow up.Fellow diver Kyle Purser said he cherishes his underwater job, but now fears it\\'s being taken away. \"When you’re watching your money disappear and you’ve got families to feed and not knowing when you\\'re going to get your next paycheck, (it\\'s) very stressful,” he said. The geoduck import market was already facing weaker demand in recent years due to the Chinese economy’s struggle to regain post-pandemic momentum. While the tariffs have only exacerbated troubles for geoduck sellers in Washington, there\\'s also been an unintended consequence: The American trade war has inadvertently boosted the Canadian geoduck business, which is facing a mere 25% tariff from China in comparison to the 125% for the U.S.Washington state in the U.S. and Canada\\'s British Columbia province are the two primary places where the wild geoducks grow naturally for commercial harvest. The two countries did healthy business primarily serving Chinese appetites for decades, in part because quantities are limited. It’s a labor-intensive and heavily-regulated harvest, as divers must go several feet below the surface to dig for them.“They love the fact that it tastes like the sea,” said James Austin, president of Canada’s Underwater Harvesters Association. “It’s a product that’s really a hit with the Chinese. It’s all about the wild coastline. It’s really prestigious.”Austin said he expects there will be 2.75 million pounds of Canadian geoducks harvested in 2025, worth approximately $60 million Canadian dollars ($43.4 million USD) in revenue. While demand has been relatively low but still steady for Canadian\\'s geoducks, Austin said they\\'re now the leading exporters for China, which has helped them negotiate higher prices as a result. For example, after Canada got hit with a 25% tariff in March, export sale prices dropped to $12 per pound, and after the U.S. got hit with a 125% tariff in April, Canadian geoducks are now being sold for $17 a pound.“We have no competitors right now,” Austin said.Yang Bin at Beihai Huaxiashougang Health Industry Company in Beihai city of Guangxi province in China said their seafood wholesale important business no longer gets geoduck from the U.S.“We don’t care about U.S. tariffs because we can get geoduck from other countries with stable prices,” Yang said.On their first week back to work since the tariff fight brought business to a standstill in Washington state, Derrick McRae and his brother pulled up about 800 pounds of wild geoducks in just one April day. He donned a full-body diving outfit with an oxygen line tethered to his boat to dive under the cold waters of an inland sea channel west of Seattle. Kneeled on the seafloor, McRae used a water spray gun to move the sand covering the geoducks. In the cloud of sediment, he felt for the neck with his hand, pulling the clam and stuffing it in a net attached to him. “We’re just kind of waiting on the edge of our seats to see what happens next,” McRae said.

In this email sent to Abel, the person says she's the 'Hitler of publicists' 'One woman has two small children under four and has been afraid to leave her house because of the sheer number of threats sent.'Private home addresses have been leaked in the court documents, which have been pushed by Lively's team.'That's then been shared on social media, and we have people threatening to harm anyone who works for the company, and their families.'What they are doing to private people through their actions has caused despicable situations.'Some of the threats, obtained by DailyMail.com, call Nathan and Abel the 'Hitler of publicists', and branded the team as 'terrorist evil'.One simply wrote: 'I hope you f***ing die', and 'I hope you never reproduce', while another email was titled 'It Ends With You.' Death threat sent to The Agency Group (TAG), which was set up by Nathan, saying they'd 'bury you' 'in the Mojave' Email sent to veteran communications strategist Melissa Nathan through TAG.

It burned to the ground and damaged the home's lawn. Jennifer Abel has been receiving a litany of death threats in the wake of the Lively sexual harassment lawsuit Unapproved Instagram comments on Abel's page, both shaming and wishing for her downfall Another threatening message was sent to Abel that wished her 'life is miserable' and that she would 'experience the worst pain ever' for dragging Taylor Swift's name into a 'smear campaign' Aragon allegedly sent messages to Sarowitz's wife and daughters' number, saying if they refused to hand over the cash then they would kidnap her.'If you fail to comply, we will take [daughter's name] hostage and she won't make graduation, at that point, we will ask for more money,' the message said.'If you guys are prepared to spend a hundred million to ruin the lives of Ms. Lively and her family, we are sure you can spare a few for your daughter.'Another message was sent to the daughter identifying her college and the address of her sorority house which she frequently visits, adding: 'You guys are not untouchable. You can upgrade your security all you want and that still won't stop us.'We are prepared to ruin all your lives over a little bit of money. The next fire we start will be from the inside.'The FBI coordinated with the Highland Park Police Department to use technology and warrants to isolate the sender and arrested Aragon last week.

Ultimately, she did not serve Wallace. Sarowitz announced on Friday that the Wayfarer Foundation was shutting down amid Baldoni's legal war with Lively Lively's team is also accused of releasing private health information about Jed Wallace, who works as a 'fixer' for Baldoni after she listed him as a defendant in her administrative complaint filed against her co-star in December Documents claim that her 'persistent efforts' to serve him caused his heart condition to flare up and spend some time in hospital. Ultimately, she did not serve Wallace However, he lodged a separate lawsuit in February, as she wrongly named him as an alleged harasser.Described as a 'precursor to a lawsuit', the document was attached to the original civil rights complaint that Lively filed in California on December 20 to kick off legal hostilities against her It Ends with Us co-star.When the actress's actual federal complaint was filed 11 days later, neither Wallace nor his Street Relations crisis management firm were among those accused, his lawyers say.But it was too late to stop media outlets from wrongly naming him and his company as defendants as they relied on the version Lively's team had already distributed to the press.The mix-up meant Texas-based Wallace was wrongly accused of harassment and retaliation against Lively by the media, his suit filed in Federal court states.He is suing for emotional harm and loss of business and asking for damages exceeding $1,000,000. While Lively didn't list Wallace as a defendant in her December 31 lawsuit, she did accuse him within the text of acting as a 'hired gun' for Baldoni and Nathan In his filing, Wallace says his business helps clients to 'navigate real-life human crisis, threats, trauma and mental health concerns.'While Lively didn't list Wallace as a defendant in her December 31 lawsuit, she did accuse him within the text of acting as a 'hired gun' for Baldoni and Nathan.Baldoni has subsequently hit back and sued the actress and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, 48, for $400million, saying her allegations were defamatory and false, and accusing her of attempting to hijack the project.The legal battle has already seen some zingers aired in court, among them Baldoni's claim that she tried to threaten him with Reynolds and erstwhile best friend Taylor Swift – referring to the superstars as 'my dragons' and comparing herself to Game of Thrones character Khaleesi.Lively has also been accused of failing to read the novel on which the movie is based until well after filming started and forcing Baldoni and his family to sit in the basement during the premiere.Attention has now turned to who else could be subpoenaed in the case, with Reynolds odds-on to have his communications scrutinized by Baldoni's team. One accusation brought forth by Baldoni's lawsuit was that Lively forced Baldoni and his family to sit in the basement during the premiere of It Ends With Us Baldoni has subsequently hit back and sued the actress and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, 48, for $400million, saying her allegations were defamatory and false, and accusing her of attempting to hijack the project Last week, speculation arose around Swift and Reynolds' friend Hugh Jackman with reports saying that they too are facing a legal grilling.Superstar singer Swift is reportedly furious over being dragged into the case and has not been photographed with Lively for months.One person who has already got one is publicist Stephanie Jones, who is also being sued by Baldoni after she allegedly turned over a phone belonging to his publicist and her former employee, Jennifer Abel.The messages on the phone between Abel and crisis PR Melissa Nathan were later used as the basis for Lively's claims of a smear campaign, although Baldoni's team hit back saying the texts were selectively edited and released the conversations in full.Jones denied handing over the texts as a favor, arguing in court papers that she turned the device over only after receiving a subpoena last October.But her claims led to fresh embarrassment for Lively after DailyMail.com revealed the subpoena had arisen from a 'sham' lawsuit filed by her company Vanzan against anonymous Does 1-10 which was dropped before the 37-year-old's sex assault case was filed. Baldoni claimed that Lively referred to herself as Khalessi and Ryan Reynolds and Taylor Swift as her 'dragons'. In the latest twist, Swift's boyfriend Travis Kelci unfollowed Reynolds on Instagram DailyMail.com recent reveal of Lively's 'sham' lawsuit had Baldoni's lawyer Bryan Freedman furiously responding that it was 'done in bad faith and constitutes a flagrant abuse of process' The revelation prompted a furious response from Baldoni's lawyer Bryan Freedman who described the Vanzan suit as a 'sham'.'Ms. Lively's and Mr. Reynolds' company Vanzan had nothing to do with this case, and they knew it,' Freedman said in a statement.'This sham lawsuit was designed to obtain subpoena power without oversight or scrutiny, and in doing so denied my clients the ability to contest the propriety, nature, and scope of the subpoena. 'There is nothing normal about this. Officers of the court have a duty of candor to the court and an obligation not to file fictitious lawsuits that have no basis in fact or law.'This was done in bad faith and constitutes a flagrant abuse of process.'\", 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Baldoni, Lively legal battle escalates: threats, leaks\\nENTITIES: Justin Baldoni, Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, Taylor Swift, The Agency Group (TAG), Wayfarer, Steve Sarowitz, Melissa Nathan, Jennifer Abel, Jed Wallace\\nEVENT: Justin Baldoni and his PR team are facing death threats and private health information leaks amidst a legal battle with Blake Lively, who accuses Baldoni of sexual harassment and orchestrating a smear campaign; Lively's team is accused of releasing private health information of Baldoni's associates, while a suspect is charged with arson and threats against the family of a film studio co-founder.\\nCONTEXT: The legal battle involves accusations of sexual harassment, defamation, and attempts to manipulate public opinion, with potential implications for the careers and reputations of those involved.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 50940, 'sourceId': 12615, 'url': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14690045/Newcastle-James-Callahan-Teelah-Cooper.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490', 'title': 'How a single comment allegedly led to a young Aussie being stabbed to death outside a kebab shop', 'publishDate': '2025-05-08T06:16:44.000Z', 'content': \"06:54, 08 May 2025, updated\\n07:16, 08 May 2025\\nBy\\nHARRISON CHRISTIAN FOR DAILY MAIL AUSTRALIA\\nJames allegedly killed over 'litter' commentOne of the six co-accused tried to flee NSW\\nIt was a simple comment about littering that allegedly led to\\xa0James Callahan being stabbed to death outside a kebab shop.\\xa0The 22-year-old had stopped for a meal on Beaumont Street in Hamilton, Newcastle in the early hours of November 17 at the time of the alleged attack.\\xa0More details have emerged since six people were arrested and charged with murder over the incident - including allegations that the girlfriend of one of the accused helped her partner to avoid arrest.\\xa0Mr Callahan and a friend were eating on the footpath when a woman threw some of her kebab out a car window as she drove past, according to a police fact sheet submitted to court and seen by The Sydney Morning Herald.\\xa0Mr Callahan made a comment about littering, prompting several of the woman's friends to fight him, police allege.\\xa0A patrolling police car broke up the scuffle, but although Mr Callahan and his friend moved to a nearby street, a car followed him and the woman's friends attacked again, police claimed.One allegedly swung a metal pole at him while another kicked and punched him.Police allege another man, Ryan Sampson, then got out of the car and stabbed Mr Callahan several times in the back and neck while he was lying face down, with one of his arms held out defensively.\\xa0 It was a simple comment about littering that allegedly led to James Callahan (pictured) being allegedly stabbed to death outside a kebab shop Teelah Cooper (pictured right) allegedly helped her boyfriend Ryan Sampson (pictured left) to avoid arrest after the incident Ryan Sampson (pictured) allegedly stabbed Mr Callahan in the back and neck while he was lying face down Cooper (pictured) is accused of being an accessory after the fact to murder and concealing an indictable offence Sampson's girlfriend, Teelah Cooper, called Sampson back to the car and drove away with him, police alleged.The next day the couple sold their car, obtained another one and drove to Queensland, where Sampson was arrested, the document alleged.\\xa0Cooper is accused of being an accessory after the fact to murder and concealing an indictable offence.\\xa0Sampson and Cooper allegedly exchanged hundreds of calls while Sampson was behind bars, in breach of her bail conditions, with Cooper 'using another name to disguise her identity'.\\xa0Her bail was revoked and she was remanded in custody, but last week Justice Stephen Rothman in the NSW Supreme Court granted her bail with strict conditions.

It’s very difficult to understand that, but if I could pause the game and say \"Gabriel Jesus, we brought you back to life, you are doing incredibly well, you’re now going to get injured\", I would say \"stop, we are going to swap him, bring another player in and continue to play the game\". Mikel Arteta has revealed the decision he regrets from this season at Arsenal Arteta admitted he wishes he had taken Gabriel Jesus off before he suffered a season-ending knee injury against Manchester United in January Arsenal went on to lose on penalties to United, and have been forced to play without a recognised striker in recent months following the injury to Jesus \\'Unfortunately we cannot do this. It is not like VAR where we can overturn the decisions like this. The decision is made there is no way back.\\'Jesus had scored six goals in as many games prior to his injury, but has been out of action for the past four months, and is not due to return until the latter stages of 2025.Just one month after Jesus injured his knee, Kai Havertz tore his hamstring during a warm-weather training camp in Dubai, leaving Arsenal without a recognised striker after they opted not to dip into the transfer market in January.Arteta has been forced to push Mikel Merino into attack, and the Spaniard has stepped up to score six goals following his change of position. However, goals have been hard to come by at times without Jesus or Havertz up top, and Arsenal looked particularly toothless in the final third during their 1-0 defeat by PSG last week.They will get the chance for redemption in Paris tonight as they bid to make their first Champions League final in 19 years, but will once again have to rely on deploying a makeshift centre forward after losing Jesus and Havertz to injury.', 'location': 'N/A', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Arteta regrets Jesus decision costing Arsenal\\nENTITIES: Mikel Arteta, Gabriel Jesus, Arsenal, Manchester United, Kai Havertz, Mikel Merino, PSG\\nEVENT: Mikel Arteta regrets not substituting Gabriel Jesus earlier, leading to a season-ending injury during an FA Cup match against Manchester United.

Credit: Small (2024). DOI: 10.1002/smll.202408349\\nScientists from the Faculty of Physics and Applied Informatics at the University of Lodz have published an article on friction in the journal Small. Their research on \"bismuth islands\" moving on the surface of graphite confirmed the existence of a totally new form of so-called superlubricity—a friction-free contact between two solid bodies.\\nThis discovery could revolutionize the way we design nanoscale machines, and even vehicles, in the future. By understanding these processes, we can create devices that can operate much more efficiently, saving on energy and resources.\\nScientists led by Dr. Hab. Paweł Kowalczyk, associate professor at the University of Lodz, have discovered a new phenomenon related to the disappearance of friction—superlubricity. This special phenomenon was observed at the contact of two solid materials, bismuth and graphite.\\nBismuth is intentionally deposited on the surface of graphite (the same material in your pencil lead) and forms extremely flat crystals, so thin that their thickness is only 2 atoms wide. The first surprise was that the bismuth crystals move around on the surface of graphene, along straight lines. This is the first-ever report of this phenomenon, changes the way we think about friction and adhesion of materials, and opens up future research and development ideas for friction reduction.\\nWhat is superlubricity?\\nSuperlubricity is a condition in which the friction between solid materials becomes imperceptible. Under normal conditions, the friction between two surfaces makes it difficult to move them relative to each other, because there are forces that bind the atoms in both materials, as if connected by tiny springs.\\nIn superlubricity systems, however, these tiny springs are so weak that the two bodies can move without resistance. This phenomenon has been relatively well-known for many years, and it is the reason why many commercial lubricants contain graphite. The atomic layers in graphite are weakly bonded, and can slide easily from each other.\\nTo date, superlubricity has always been isotropic: the friction is canceled in all directions equally. Now, with this new discovery, a new form of superlubricity has been achieved, where the friction is zero in one direction only, and has conventional friction in other directions.\\nYou can even experiment at home with this. After using graphite-based pencils and before washing your hands, rub your graphite-coated fingers together. You can actually feel the extremely low friction, as the tips of your fingers can move very easily, and the whole thing feels very \"slippery.\"\\nHow does it work?\\nMicroscopy sequences presented in the article show that the bismuth crystals deposited on the surface of graphite are not stationary at all. Although they are solids, they behave a bit like oil drops on a hot surface, and constantly move from place to place.\\nSurprisingly, their movement always takes place along straight lines, due to a very specific arrangement of their atomic lattices. These straight lines are reminiscent of highways, and because they enable fast collective motion of crystals along one direction, are called nano-highways.\\nWhen the statistical distribution of the crystal trajectories is measured, it turns out that it can be described using a power law—that is, most of the bismuth crystals move on the surface spontaneously along very short distances, such as very short lengths of 10 or 20 nm; but a significant number of crystals also travel much larger distances, of up to 1000 nm. Interestingly, these nano-highway lengths follow a type of random walk called \"Lévy flight.\" This way of statistically moving on the surface is extremely rare in the study of solid materials.\\nThis type of movement is particularly interesting as it occurs in many unexpected areas of nature, in particular in collective and intelligent systems, such as animals searching for food. To survive, foraging patterns are optimized when, occasionally, large traveling distances are made to avoid searching for food in empty areas for too long. This takes place not only in natural systems, but in human ones too: the flow of information on the Internet and the stock market also behave according to Lévy flight statistics.\\nWhy is it important?\\nThis discovery may have major implications for the future of nanotechnology. For example, by understanding how these islands move on graphite, scientists may develop materials that have much lower friction, which is much more present in microscopic systems than in large-scale objects.\\nSuch materials could be used in a variety of devices, from precision machinery to vehicles, which, thanks to lower friction, would be more efficient and less subject to wear. This, in turn, would allow us to save on energy costs (the energy spent on moving the object will not turn into heat) and material savings (much less repair will be required), which would have a positive impact on the environment. If friction could be removed altogether from society, humanity would save nearly a quarter of carbon emissions.\\nIn the future, the researchers plan to conduct even more research that will allow them to better understand how various factors, such as temperature, the size of the islands and the type of defects on the graphite surface, affect the friction and movement of these islands. They are also looking for other materials that have similar properties.\\nMore information:\\nMaxime Le Ster et al, Evidence of Directional Structural Superlubricity and Lévy Flights in a van der Waals Heterostructure, Small (2024).

In recent years, the esteemed prize—handed out annually at the World Science Fiction Society convention, also known as Worldcon, whose members vote on the honorees—has weathered its share of controversies, with negative headlines (take your pick: geographical censorship; racism; ties to defense manufacturers; anti-“woke” backlash before anti-“woke” was even a thing) sometimes getting more attention than the books and other media the Hugos aim to celebrate. As io9 previously reported, this year’s flashpoint is the use of ChatGPT—but fortunately, not in a way that has any impact on the actual Hugo Awards. The Hugo ceremony is just one part of August’s Seattle Worldcon 2025; it’s also a convention that hosts panels featuring authors and other sci-fi and fantasy luminaries. Within the past two weeks, it was discovered that ChatGPT had been used to help vet program participants; three people involved, including two Hugo administrators, resigned as a result, and Seattle Worldcon 2025 chair Kathy Bond issued first a statement on the issue, followed by a separate apology. However, the issue is still rankling sci-fi and fantasy fans on social media, not to mention would-be Hugos honorees; as blog File 770 reported, author Yoon Ha Lee went so far as to remove his novel Moonstorm from Hugo consideration (it had been nominated for the Lodestar Award honoring YA works). Yesterday, Bond posted a third message about the controversy, with an additional statement from program division head SunnyJim Morgan.\\nBond’s portion reiterates how ChatGPT was used, with details and specifics. Of particular note, it was not used for “creating the Hugo Award Finalist list or announcement video” or “administering the process for Hugo Award nominations.” She also includes a renewed apology not just about the use of AI, but the way she initially responded to concerns by releasing a “flawed statement” when the issue was first brought to light. She also says that “we are redoing the part of our program process that used ChatGPT, with that work being performed by new volunteers from outside our current team” and pledges that Worldcon—whose staff is all-volunteer, she notes—will do all it can to regain the community’s trust moving forward.\\nTo that end, Morgan’s statement is also both apology and even deeper dive into how ChatGPT was used, including the actual prompt used to vet potential program participants: REQUEST Using the list of names provided, please evaluate each person for scandals. Scandals include but are not limited to homophobia, transphobia, racism, harassment, sexual misconduct, sexism, fraud. Each person is typically an author, editor, performer, artist or similar in the fields of science fiction, fantasy, and or related fandoms.\\nThe objective is to determine if an individual is unsuitable as a panelist for an event. Please evaluate each person based on their digital footprint, including social, articles, and blogs referencing them. Also include file770.com as a source. Provide sources for any relevant data. Morgan reports that his team “did not simply accept the results that were returned” as a result of ChatGPT’s vetting. “Instead, links to primary content returned during vetting were reviewed by our team and myself before a final decision whether to invite the person was made. Ultimately, this process led to fewer than five people being disqualified from receiving an invitation to participate in the program due to information previously unknown.”\\nRead the full statements from Bond and Morgan here; Bond writes that Seattle Worldcon’s next update will come May 13, so it’ll be interesting to see if there’s more coming on the ChatGPT issue, or if the organizers will be moving forward from this point.

The nostalgic AR has had its time to shine in Verdansk, and according to Activision, that time is now over. The AR received some nerfs to its headshot multiplier, sprint to fire speed, and aim down sight speed. The AK-74 (max damage nerf) has been brought down a notch in the update, while the C9 SMG got a buff to its maximum damage. The Krig C has also gotten buffed with some changes “to allow it to compete at longer range engagements.” And in one final nerf, the HDR sniper rifle that’s been terrorizing Verdansk also got taken back a bit. The HDR nerf in question is all about flinch resistance, which prevents aim punch while aiming down sights with the sniper. It’s been nerfed by a whopping 60 percent in the update, along with further nerfs to flinch resistance for a couple of popular Stock attachments.

He probably just said it more to amuse me, because he obviously knew what I was going through at that moment.

The year before, the UK’s market share was about a quarter — just slightly ahead of the US.Newer formats such as The 1% Club — made by BBC Studios — and The Piano — by Fremantle — continued to sell strongly, K7 Media said, while older programmes such as MasterChef and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? also had dozens of active versions worldwide.ITV Studios, the TV production arm of the UK media group, had another successful year with older formats such as Come Dine With Me and Love Island as well as The Voice, which K7 Media said had 29 local versions returning for new seasons. ITV Studios also created successful spin-offs of popular shows, such as a junior version of The Voice.The data highlights the strength of UK TV production as the government draws up proposals to support the creative industries in its forthcoming industrial strategy this summer.\\xa0Overseas groups such as Banijay, the French TV company, and RedBird IMI, the US-based investor that owns All3Media, have considered offers to buy or merge with ITV Studios, which was the second-biggest distributor by volume of active adaptations in 2024.“British TV has a history of success around the globe,” said K7 Media boss Keri Lewis Brown. “What we’re seeing now is the UK’s storytelling heritage, format innovation and global collaboration showing resurgence in a challenging climate and fast-changing world.”Creating homegrown TV shows that can then be sold to other markets is a more sustainably lucrative business model than making shows for overseas rivals such as US streamers, which also make many programmes in the UK.\\xa0Many shows being exported from the UK are made by public service broadcasters such as the BBC and ITV, which have called on the government to support the creative sector to help it compete with larger US streaming platforms.\\xa0K7 Media said more than 50 UK-originated format adaptations were already confirmed for 2025.Executives have raised concerns this week about the reliance on US money after President Donald Trump threatened to impose 100 per cent tariffs on films made overseas.\\xa0“Britain is once again setting the pace for unscripted television around the world,” said K7 Media’s Trang Nguyen. The group said French formats had also continued to sell well, including The A Talks, where celebrities are interviewed by journalists with autism.

Calls to rethink the benefits cuts, as well as other policies, have been growing after Labour lost 187 council seats during the local election last week.Disability minister Sir Stephen Timms told the MPs the goal of the reforms was to make sure the welfare system was \"financially sustainable in the long term\".In March, the government announced a major welfare shake-up aimed at saving money and supporting people who can work to find jobs.Ministers said changes to a key disability benefit called personal independence payment (Pip) and universal credit (UC) would save around £5bn a year by the end of 2030 and get more people into work.Overall, the government spends £65bn a year on health and disability-related benefits. Before the government announced the Pip and UC changes, this was projected to increase to £100bn by 2029.The government estimated that 3.2 million families could be worse off as a result of the reforms, while 3.8 million families will be better off by 2030.The government is expected to pass a new law to make the welfare changes, giving MPs a chance to vote on the plans.Speaking during the debate in Westminster Hall, Diane Abbott, the Labour MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, said the government was \"making a conscious choice to balance its books on the backs of people on welfare\".Ian Byrne, who represents Liverpool West Derby, said he would \"swim through vomit to vote against\" proposed welfare changes.Labour MPs Richard Burgon, Rachael Maskell, Andy McDonald, Cat Eccles, Nadia Whittome, Imran Hussain, Steve Witherden and Ian Lavery also said they would vote against the government\\'s proposals.They were joined by John McDonnell, an independent MP for Hayes and Harlington who had the whip removed by Labour for rebelling against the government over the two-child benefit cap.A number of other Labour MPs have also indicated they are minded to oppose the benefits cuts in comments at events, in articles for local papers, as well as on social media.Disability minister Sir Stephen Timms defended the proposals, saying it was not sustainable for welfare spending to rise at the current rate.\"The current system produces poor employment outcomes, high economic inactivity, low living standards, high costs to the taxpayer. It needs to change,\" he said. \"We want a more proactive, pro-work system that supports people better and supports the economy as well.\"Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has come under increasing pressure to change course on some policy decisions.At Prime Minister Questions on Wednesday, Sir Keir defended the decision to axe winter fuel payments for millions of pensioners.It came after a group of about 45 Labour MPs representing seats in northern England and the Midlands joined those urging the government to rethink the move.The planned changes to disability benefits could become the next big political flashpoint, with legislation likely to be brought to the House of Commons in June.The BBC has been told some potential rebels are being assured they won\\'t lose the party whip if they abstain – or make themselves scarce – when the vote comes.The government is not at risk of defeat, given Labour has a large majority, but a sizable rebellion could show the extent of the discontent within the party.Senior minister Pat McFadden said \"we have to win the fight for Britain\\'s future\" while speaking at the Parliamentary Labour Party\\'s first gathering since the local elections, party sources said.The Cabinet Office minister criticised Reform UK, including the new mayor of Greater Lincolnshire, Dame Andrea Jenkyns, who said her party would \"reset Britain to its glorious past\" in her victory speech.McFadden said: \"Labour is always at its best when we look to the future.

AccuWeather had already predicted an especially active season — which begins June 1 — with up to 10 hurricanes out at sea, and its meteorologists are now forecasting a hotter-than-normal summer on land. Last week, the company warned that the three months could bring “sweltering heat, severe weather, intense wildfires, and the start of a dynamic hurricane season” — an echo of last summer, which was the hottest on record. In some places, like coastal cities along the Gulf Coast, those hazards could combine into dangerous “compound disasters,” with heat waves and hurricanes arriving back-to-back.\\nThe Trump administration’s cost-cutting crusade could make this summer’s weather all the more perilous. Mass layoffs at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have hurricane forecasters worried that they’ll lose access to the data they need to make accurate predictions of where storms will make landfall and at what intensity. And as electricity gets more expensive and global warming forces households to run their air-conditioning more, advocates worry that the loss of federal support for people struggling to pay their electric bills could leave a swath of the population especially vulnerable.\\nPresident Donald Trump’s proposed 2026 budget, unveiled last week, would cancel the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which provides $4 billion a year to help people pay electricity bills, said Alison Coffey, senior policy analyst at the Boston-based nonprofit Initiative for Energy Justice. “We are about to experience one of the hottest summers on record,” Coffey said. “And this is happening at a time when U.S. households are really, really struggling to pay their utility bills.”\\nAccuWeather’s summer forecast isn’t the kind you get for your local weather, so they can’t tell you if it will be raining in your town on the Fourth of July. Instead, this seasonal forecast looks at weather trends in March and April, as well as larger phenomena like La Niña and El Niño, the two bands of warm and cold water in the Pacific Ocean that influence the atmosphere above the western U.S. AccuWeather compares all that to how those spring and summer months looked in previous years to get an idea of what might unfold this time around.\\nAccuWeather says that temperatures could run higher than average across the vast majority of the country this summer. Its forecast also warns of warmer nights, especially in the eastern U.S. These make heat waves all the more unbearable as the human body can’t get the respite of a cool night to bring down the physiological stress.\\nThe eastern U.S. could also suffer through heat waves punctuated by thunderstorms that load the atmosphere with humidity. Those conditions make the human body less efficient at sweating, raising the risk of heat-related illnesses and deaths. Heat kills more people in the U.S. than any other natural disaster, in part because it can aggravate existing conditions like heart disease and asthma.\\nOut West, the Dakotas, Montana, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon could see temperatures 3 degrees Fahrenheit (or more) higher than average. “The daytime highs are a bigger issue, [records] that could be challenged or broken in parts of the Northern Rockies and in the Northwest coming up this summer,” said Paul Pastelok, a senior meteorologist at AccuWeather.\\nHigh temperatures are\\xa0going to increase wildfire risk, Pastelok added, because a dry, heat-baked landscape is a flammable landscape. Right now almost 40 percent of the U.S. is under drought conditions, double the area of last year. Some parts of the American West actually had a fairly wet winter, but that can also cause problems because strong-growing plants and trees can turn into fuel in the extra-hot summer heat. And as the season wears on, the landscape gets drier, so it’s more liable to burn catastrophically.\\nDay after day of relentless heat, especially if it’s humid out too, forces people to run the AC more to stay healthy. For the rich, that’s no problem. But lower-income folks suffer a high “energy burden,” meaning a $200 monthly utility bill is a much larger proportion of their income. Americans are also wrestling with an escalating cost-of-living crisis as rent and inflation march higher. With 1 in 6 American households now behind on their utility bills, according to the Initiative for Energy Justice, and 3 million of them having their power shut off each year, the danger is losing power during a heat wave this summer.\\nCity dwellers face added risk here because of the urban heat island effect, the way sidewalks, parking lots, and buildings trap heat and make cities much hotter than surrounding rural areas. Lower-income neighborhoods get 15 to 20 degrees hotter than richer neighborhoods because they have fewer trees, which provide shade and cooling, according to Vivek Shandas, a climate adaptation scientist at Portland State University. “Those neighborhoods and the residents living in them just bear the brunt of that heat wave a lot more acutely than someone living in a more highly invested neighborhood, where tree canopy is lush.”\\nIt will take a whole lot longer to fix the systemic issues that drive heat disparities in cities. But in the meantime, access to air-conditioning will be increasingly crucial as the planet warms. “Having financial assistance for low-income households to make sure that they can keep their electricity and their cooling on during the sweltering summer is more crucial than ever,” Coffey said.', 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Hotter Summer, Hurricane Threat, Energy Assistance Cuts\\nENTITIES: AccuWeather, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Donald Trump, Alison Coffey, Initiative for Energy Justice, Vivek Shandas, Portland State University\\nEVENT: AccuWeather forecasts a hotter-than-normal summer with potential for record-breaking heat and increased hurricane activity, while proposed budget cuts threaten energy assistance programs.\\nCONTEXT: Rising energy costs and potential budget cuts exacerbate heat vulnerability.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 50163, 'sourceId': 12588, 'url': 'https://www.eurogamer.net/just-weeks-after-sale-pokemon-go-will-soon-let-you-play-more-from-home-but-developers-say-monopoly-go-owner-isnt-behind-sweeping-changes', 'title': \"Pokémon Go changes will let you play more remotely - but developers say Monopoly Go owner isn't behind sweeping moves\", 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T17:00:49.000Z', 'content': '\"The timing is very interesting for us, but these are things we have discussions on for years.\"\\nImage credit: Pokémon Go.\\nPokémon Go is making big changes to let players do more while sitting at home, just weeks after the announcement that it would be sold to Monopoly Go owner Scopely as part of a deal worth $3.5bn.\\nBut in an interview with Eurogamer, the game\\'s development team says these changes - which double the number of Remote Raids possible per day and add remote options to other types of gameplay - were decided upon separately from Niantic\\'s sale.\\nIndeed, Pokémon Go senior producer John Funtanilla tells me that this shake-up - the biggest to impact the game in several years - was \"100 percent\" being made by the game\\'s own leadership and comes as part of ongoing discussions going back \"years\".\\nBeginning next week, Pokémon Go will permanently increase its daily Remote Raid limit from five to 10, doubling the number of remote activities you can perform from your sofa without going outside.\\nPokémon Go Gigantamax trailer.Watch on YouTube\\nRemote raids were originally introduced during the era of Covid lockdowns as a way for the game to continue despite the game\\'s original creator Niantic previously championing outdoors play. The feature - which proved hugely popular with fans and helped Niantic make more money from the game than ever - has since remained, though with limitations added in 2023 to try and incentivise outdoors play once again.\\nNow, the needle is swinging back the other way.\\nIn other new changes, Pokémon Go will next week allow players to permanently use Remote Raid Passes to access Shadow Raids, as well as Max Battles for Dynamax and Gigantamax Pokémon - which were previously only available via in-person play.\\nThe changes go live globally on 13th May at 7pm UK time (11am Pacific), and come with a couple of other Max Battle tweaks. The feature\\'s Max Particle (MP) limit will be boosted to 1500 so you can hold more than before, and you\\'ll get more Premier Balls and XP from battling in-person. Otherwise, pricing and other mechanics remain unchanged (you won\\'t be able to collect MP from afar).\\n\"It\\'s entirely the leadership here, internally, and definitely 100 percent our decision.\"\\n\"These changes take a long time to get into the game,\" Funtanilla says to me as we speak via video call, distancing today\\'s announcements from the game\\'s recent sale to Scopely. \"These are things we take measured approaches to, and it\\'s entirely a Pokémon Go decision. These are things we have looked at for years - we\\'ve looked at the data, we\\'ve looked at the community feedback. It\\'s entirely the leadership here, internally, and definitely 100 percent our decision to make these changes.\"\\nIt\\'s easy to imagine Pokémon Go\\'s community being skeptical of the timing - and indeed, the possibility of Scopely loosening or outright removing the game\\'s Remote Raid Pass limit was floated by many fans after word that Niantic was selling up became public. But Funtanilla is adamant that such a big decision for the future of Pokémon Go would not have been made in such a short period of time.\\n\"The timing is very interesting for us,\" Funtanilla acknowledges, \"but these are things we have discussions on for years. I\\'ve been at Niantic for a good while, I worked on Shadow Raids and it\\'s something we brought up at the time, we discussed it internally and everything was towards investing in communities and making sure we were expanding that gameplay,\" he continues, referencing Niantic\\'s push to get people back outside in early 2023, as the world recovered from the worst impacts of Covid.\\n\"It\\'s measured approaches to get to this point,\" Funtanilla adds, \"there are a lot of micro milestones along the way. It\\'s not something we can just flip on.\" Indeed, these changes follow a test back in January this year where players could use Remote Raid Passes to battle Shadow Ho-Oh, something Funtanilla points to now as part of the team\\'s test for how remote raiding Shadow Pokémon impacted player behaviour.\\n\"Back in January we did run Shadow Ho-Oh [as a Remote Raid oppurtunity] and we tested that,\" Funtanilla says. \"We\\'ve built years and years of features with Shadow Raids, Gigantamax, Dynamax, Party Play - features getting players outside, finding and being part of their communities. It came to a point where we\\'re like, \\'let\\'s see how this does. Is it going to impact community play? Is it going to help us expand gameplay and players globally, being able to make connections?\\' And it went very well. It\\'s something where we saw that these kinds of systems can truly coexist.\\n\"The magic of Pokémon Go is still playing in person and meeting up in communities.\"\\n\"But it\\'s not to say... you know, we\\'ve invested so much through Campfire Community Ambassadors. And in March, we actually had record-breaking Community Ambassador check-ins, with 1m check-ins at the time. So this is definitely not for the lack of community.\"\\nFinding a balance between increasing player engagement - the number of people playing, and paying - and maintaining the value of what people are playing for remains crucial, Funtanilla continues, which is why there are still limits to daily remote raiding - even if they are now higher.\\n\"I remember introducing Shadow Raids and the push to get people outside, including the controversial raise in price for Remote Raid Passes,\" Funtanilla says. \"Those changes were sweeping. We changed the price, we changed a Trainer\\'s ability to engage with the content over and over. And I agree with it - there\\'s definitely unhealthy habits there but also we wanted to make sure that we can can protect the content, to make sure there is a game there for people to play.\\n\"Going from five to 10 [Remote Raid passes per day limit] might seem like a lot, but that is a baseline increase and I\\'m always pushing to make sure we don\\'t overreach, otherwise we get in a position where we might have to roll back decisions,\" he continues. \"The magic of Pokémon Go is still playing in person and meeting up in communities. It\\'s always going to be the most cost effective way to play - the difficulty will come down and it\\'s more cost effective to use MP in person without Remote Raid Passes.\"\\nSpeaking of costs, the need to effectively spend two currencies - MP and a Remote Raid Pass - to remotely engage with Max Battles does feel particularly punitive. But Funtanilla\\'s response here is that the value is justified by the option to battle better versions of Pokémon at a player\\'s convenience.\\n\"We have to make sure we protect the value of that content.\"\\n\"I understand folks\\' sentiments on pricing there, and to me it comes down to content,\" he says. \"Dynamax and Gigantamax Pokémon are effectively +1 Pokémon, they can do everything other Pokémon can do but have specific utility in Dynamax and Gigantamax battles. If you station these Pokémon you get candies, and you can station Legendary Pokémon. You get access to this whole ecosystem. We have to make sure we protect the value of that content.\\n\"It does also come down also to convenience, and folks being able to do this on their own time - and that\\'s something we also want to support. In recent years now we\\'re moving towards evolving with players, making sure that they can enjoy the game their way.\"\\nSo why make these changes now? Funtanilla notes the amount of content in the game - \"Dynamax, Gigantamax, there\\'s a whole new vector of content that can be gotten from that feature, on top of Shadow Raids, Mega Raids\" - as a reason to offer more flexibility. And with Max Battles, the team wanted to see their impact and rollout first with in-person play, so communities could reap the rewards of having a reason to meet up again and work together.\\n\"The number one thing was, let\\'s get the feature out there,\" Funtanilla says of the game\\'s launch of Max Battles in September 2024. \"Let\\'s see how the community interacts with it. These are very difficult end-game battles. And we had [huge] community check-ins, in Taiwan I think we had like 4000 players coming together. It\\'s revitalised that gameplay. For remotes, it\\'s something we\\'ve always tried to explore but those discussions could take years to find the exact [implementation]. And I think at this point it lines up with us expanding gameplay.\"', 'location': 'GLOBAL', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Pokémon Go increases remote play options after sale\\nENTITIES: Pokémon Go, Niantic, Scopely, John Funtanilla\\nEVENT: Pokémon Go is increasing the daily Remote Raid limit from five to 10 and allowing Remote Raid Passes for Shadow Raids and Max Battles, despite being sold to Scopely.\\nCONTEXT: Changes follow a test in January and aim to balance player engagement with the core in-person community experience.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 53433, 'sourceId': 12762, 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/07/who-is-sarah-witty-labor-greens-leader-adam-bandt-melbourne-seat-federal-election-2025', 'title': 'Who is Sarah Witty?

In a post on her Instagram account, she shared she had also run a ballet studio, owned a Subway franchise and worked as both a small business lender and insurer.In 2017, she began working with Homes for Homes – a social enterprise that raises funds for community housing by encouraging property owners to donate 0.1% of their sale price to charity. During her time there, Witty said she helped raise $110m in donations.\\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email\\nShe has said her experience as a foster carer has also shaped her worldview.Witty and her partner began fostering after 13 unsuccessful rounds of IVF, and receiving some advice from her mum.“At the time, I must admit it was hard to hear, but she said, ‘Maybe you need to be a mum for all children,’” Witty said in a video posted on social media.“I thought she was ridiculous, first of all, and then I thought, ‘Hang on a minute, maybe foster care might be the right place for me to be.’”Witty said she had lost count of how many children she’s fostered but the first child, a boy, “taught us how to be carers”. There was also another girl who came to them at four months and stayed until she was four, who remained in contact with them today.“She’s now seven, nearly eight, and she’s in our life and mum and dad keep her connected with us,” Witty said.Witty ran for Yarra city council in 2020 and 2024. Last year, she finished third with just over 20% of the vote in a tight three-way contest with the Greens and an independent.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotion“My absolute favourite place in Melbourne is Richmond. It is my home. It’s where I love to spend my time,” she said in another social media video.She said her favourite thing to do is walk the Yarra Trail, with the city in view, particularly at twilight.Her campaign for federal parliament was launched by Penny Wong, who is also in Labor’s left faction.Witty said she wanted to enter politics because she wanted to do more to address “disadvantage in the world”.“I’ve seen lots of disadvantage through my time in many different roles, and I really want to make sure that every person gets the best chance for the best life that they deserve,” she said.Witty is not the only female Labor candidate to knock out a Greens MP this election, with two Queensland women winning seats from the minor party in Brisbane’s inner north and south: Madonna Jarrett unseating Stephen Bates in Brisbane and Renee Coffey defeating Max Chandler-Mather in Griffith.Witty is also the second Labor candidate to defeat a party leader this election, after Ali France made history unseating the Liberal leader, Peter Dutton, in her third attempt at Dickson in Brisbane’s west.', 'location': 'AUS', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': \"HEADLINE: Labor's Witty defeats Greens leader Adam Bandt\\nENTITIES: Sarah Witty, Adam Bandt, Labor Party, Greens, Penny Wong\\nEVENT: Labor's Sarah Witty is projected to have defeated Greens leader Adam Bandt in the seat of Melbourne, marking a significant upset in the election.\\nCONTEXT: Sarah Witty's victory marks a significant shift in Melbourne's political landscape, potentially ending the Greens' stronghold in the seat.\", 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 50741, 'sourceId': 12613, 'url': 'https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/keir-starmer-prime-minister-rollsroyce-britain-london-b1226467.html', 'title': 'Starmer to warn of Second World War parallels as he hails ‘defence dividend’', 'publishDate': '2025-05-08T00:48:24.000Z', 'content': 'Sir Keir Starmer will warn of modern parallels with the Second World War, as he urges the UK to seize the “dividend” from his plans to raise defence spending.The Prime Minister is also expected to announce a £563 million contract for Rolls-Royce for the maintenance of Britain’s fleet of Typhoon fighter jets, as he speaks at a defence conference in London on Thursday.Ministers have been keen to stress the boost to jobs and prosperity that plans to increase the UK’s defence spending to 2.5% of economic output by 2027 could provide, as they seek to grow the economy.Speaking at the London Defence Conference, the Prime Minister will say: “Our task now is to seize the defence dividend – felt directly in the pockets of working people, rebuilding our industrial base and creating the jobs of the future.”At the conference attended by figures from the defence industry, the military, and academics, Sir Keir will add that capitalising on the defence hike should be a “national effort, and a “time for the state, business and society to join hands, in pursuit of the security of the nation and the prosperity of its people”.“An investment in peace, but also an investment in British pride and the British people to build a nation that, once again, lives up to the promises made to the generation who fought for our values, our freedom and our security,” he will say.Sir Keir will also pay tribute to the veterans of the Second World War who fought in the European theatre, as the UK marks 80 years since the Allies accepted the surrender of Nazi Germany.But he is also expected to reference modern conflicts – such as the Ukraine war – in his tribute.He will say: “Britain’s victory was not just a victory for Britain. It was a victory for good against the assembled forces of hatred, tyranny and evil, for the light of our values – in a world that tried to put them out.“Now, as you know, there are people who would happily do likewise today. Our values and security are confronted on a daily basis. We must use this moment to deliver security and renewal for our country.”The comparison between the Second World War and turmoil in the modern world comes just a day after former US president Joe Biden warned about the impact of allowing Vladimir Putin to keep territory he has captured in Ukraine as part of a peace deal.Mr Biden said his successor Donald Trump’s pressure on Ukraine to give up territory to Russia amounted to “modern-day appeasement”.The charged, historical term refers to a failed effort to stop the Nazis annexing power through a peace agreement in the 1930s.Writing in The Times, Mr Healey said Russia’s Ukrainian invasion was a “harsh reminder that tyranny has not been eliminated”.“Europe’s borders are once more being redrawn by force. The foundations of the international order formed in the wake of 1945 are being tested as never before.

After being diagnosed, Emma underwent surgery to remove the most affected part of her colon, and then she had chemotherapy for around a year, with breaks inbetween each round Emma met her husband Andrew about a year and a half after being diagnosed, and she says he has been 'steadfastly by my side through everything' 'My mom, Barbara and big sister, Anne and myself had dubbed ourselves Team Weston (our family name before marriage).\\xa0'I met my husband, Andrew about a year and a half after being diagnosed, and he has been steadfastly by my side through everything and I am so, so lucky to have them!'Research indicates a link between the consumption of red meat and ultra-processed foods and an increased risk of colon cancer.\\xa0Emma says since her diagnosis, she has made a conscious effort to cut these from her diet and 'keep in tune' with her body.\\xa0Food aside, the brunette says another change triggered by her cancer is her mindset.\\xa0She explains: 'Dealing with cancer for more than a decade has taught me what’s really important in life, to not take very good day for granted, and to realize how important it is not only be active within this ever growing community of young cancer patients, but to give back however you can.\\xa0'In some ways I feel like I’m behind my peers in terms of career and family life, but in other ways, I feel more mature and steadfast.'\\xa0Offering advice to others in terms of being alert to cancer, Emma concludes: 'Knowing one’s family background or history of cancer is pretty critical.\\xa0 'If you have a lot of cancer in your family, like I do, I advise paying close attention to your body and getting screened and tested as soon as or as regularly as you can.\\xa0'Colon cancer doesn’t necessarily show a lot of symptoms until it is somewhat advanced - so for young people, it’s harder to detect if something is wrong.'\", 'location': 'USA', 'completeness': 'COMPLETE', 'relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'summary': 'HEADLINE: Woman beats terminal colon cancer via trial\\nENTITIES: Emma Dimery, Dr. Emil Lou, University of Minnesota, American Cancer Society\\nEVENT: Emma Dimery was diagnosed with terminal colon cancer at 23 but beat the odds after a clinical trial involving gene editing technology; she is now sharing her story to raise awareness.\\nCONTEXT: Early onset colon cancer is increasing in young adults.', 'createdAt': '2025-05-08T13:22:46.692Z'}, {'id': 52257, 'sourceId': 12389, 'url': 'https://www.menshealth.com/health/a64689694/sperm-racing-event-la-review/', 'title': 'I Watched Sperm Race With Hundreds of Teens. It Was a Total Sh*t Show.', 'publishDate': '2025-05-07T13:00:00.000Z', 'content': \"THERE ARE MANY things one can do to relax at the end of the week. Dinner and drinks with your partner. A baseball game. The movies. I chose to spend the last Friday night in April inside a downtown Los Angeles sound stage, designed to resemble a Vegas title fight arena, to watch sperm race.This Sperm Racing event (I know, I know) was conceived by Eric Zhu, a 17-year-old tech entrepreneur from Indiana who got kicked out of high school after the principal caught him taking fundraising meetings from the bathroom. The precocious teen now lives in San Francisco, running one of his bathroom-born companies, Aviato, which builds B2B software tools. He’s also a general partner at Bachmanity Capital, which backs startups in deep tech and space (as in literal outer space). According to Zhu, the idea for Sperm Racing started as a joke. An unnamed billionaire—described by the event’s (also teenage) media handler as someone who moves in the same circles as right-wing, tech demi-god Peter Thiel—flew Zhu to New York and asked for his “craziest” idea. He pitched competitive sperm racing, assuming it would flop. Instead, the billionaire loved it. He didn’t love it enough to fund it, but the reaction got the ball rolling. Zhu soon raised $1.5 million, mostly from friends at early-stage venture funds, to “turn health into a sport.” When I first saw the buzz around Sperm Racing about a week before the event—posters with the “racers” posing shirtless like fighters and tweets with captions like “our generation is cooked” and “are men okay?”—my reaction was existential resignation. The internet spectacle felt like the inevitable collision of meme culture, bro-podcast masculinity, and the ongoing effort to biotech-ify literally everything. But that reaction softened when I read the event’s manifesto, which frames Sperm Racing as a spectacle with a purpose: raising awareness about an important issue. “Male fertility is declining. Like, a lot,” it read. “It’s happening quietly, steadily, and nobody’s really talking about it.”It’s true. A major 2017 meta-analysis of over 40,000 men found that average sperm concentration had dropped by more than 50 percent over four decades. It could be due to a mix of factors: genetic and biological (varicoceles; hormonal imbalances), lifestyle (poor diet, smoking, drinking, stress), and environmental (“forever chemicals” and microplastics are everywhere, including our junk). Still, is a sperm race really the answer to *waves hands* all this?The event was supposed to take place at the Hollywood Palladium, a classic Los Angeles concert venue that’s hosted everyone from Frank Sinatra to Jay-Z. Zhu claimed Sperm Racing would draw 5,000 people, which should’ve raised a red flag, considering the Palladium maxes out at around 4,000 people. So I wasn’t entirely surprised to learn the venue cancelled their contract days before the race for reasons Zhu wouldn’t disclose. Instead, I got a last-minute email the day before the race inviting press to swing by a setup at a totally different location: Los Angeles Center Studios, where they just so happened to be filming The Lincoln Lawyer. A lucky break, maybe—just in case things got so out of hand the Sperm Racing team needed a slick TV attorney.That evening, Zhu met me and about a half dozen other members of the media inside a cavernous soundstage, where three dozen production assistants were hammering, shouting, and trying to rig up a digital scoreboard and a jumbotron the size of a highway billboard. Zhu was accompanied by Shane Fan, his co-founder (one of three) who has his own blockchain startup but is better known for making social media videos that estimate people’s real height. Zhu looked every bit the teenager—lazy posture, black hair hanging over his forehead, braces recently off. He wore blue jeans, a dark gray T-shirt, and white Air Force Ones, speaking in rapid, machine-gun bursts as he explained how the whole thing was supposed to work.Drawing inspiration from F1, UFC, and the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson boxing match, Sperm Racing would include two races. The first would be a single, prizeless, do-or-die-match between internet personalities Noah Boat and Jimmy Zhang. Then, the title match, a best-of-three race between Asher Proeger, a freshman at UCLA, and Tristan Wilcher, a sophomore at rival USC. Both had been given $1,000 to “train” during a prep period that, according to tongue-in-cheek promo videos, involved Wilcher compulsively working out and downing two gallons of pineapple juice. Proeger apparently focused on eating ice cream, steak, and tanning his balls—which, ironically, reads more like a checklist of what not to do for healthy sperm. The guy with the fastest swimmers would get $10,000. “It was a lot harder than we thought to race sperm,” Zhu said as he explained that his team had to scramble to pull together the elaborate production and develop the technology that could somehow make watching sperm…compelling. First, the racers would give a sperm sample at the venue about an hour before showtime. It would be warmed, filtered for the fastest swimmers, and placed on a microscopic track in fluid that mimics the female reproductive tract. The sperm would then be released, and computer vision—basically AI that interprets visual data—would follow their movement and turn it into the animated race that we, and those watching the livestream at home, saw on screen. Each race would run about two minutes.“We spent all the money on this event, which might be stupid,” Zhu said casually when asked how the $1.5 million had been allocated. “But our goal is to go bigger and bigger, right?” As I thought about the fact a group of teenagers had, in a matter of weeks, blown through enough money to buy a house to build the Daytona 500 of semen, I simply wrote “gonna be a shit show” in my notes. AND A SHIT show it was.When I arrived the next day, about an hour before the race, the arena buzzed with the kind of nervous energy that screams “we are absolutely not going to pull this off.” Zhu, who was wearing the same clothes as the day before, jogged across the arena trailed by two boys filming him with DSLR cameras. On a small island stage branching off from the main setup, a high-end inverted research microscope sat surrounded by cables and gear. Next to the apparatus, a bald man, clearly one of the lead producers, stood wearing headphones and a pained expression.“Can I get confirmation that the science is a go?” he said multiple times into the microphone. “The clock is ticking.”Perched on a raised VIP platform with purple banquettes, a tall guy in a skin-tight white bodysuit fidgeted in place, dressed as a lone spermatozoon (yep, the singular of sperm). Overhead, the scoreboards flashed the Sperm Racing logo and cycled through a rotating lineup of seminal puns: “Almost Ready to Bust,” “Jizz a Few More Minutes,” and “Cumming Soon.”When they finally opened the doors, the crowd—mostly teenagers and more like 400 people, not 4,000—wandered in looking a little lost. Some wore streetwear, others repped USC or UCLA jerseys. A few slipped on $40 “Swim Team” Sperm Racing tees being hawked outside. Lest you think this is only an event for dudes, I talked to Annie, a young goth from Santa Monica with a septum piercing and chrome grills. When I asked how she’d heard about the event, she shrugged: “I saw a meme.”Later, I met Stephanie Sabourin, an actual nurse who specializes in male reproductive health. She was there representing the at-home sperm testing startup Legacy, a “loose sponsor” of the event and had skipped the opening day of the nation’s biggest urology conference in Vegas—weirdly, happening the same weekend—to be here. “I think they’ve done a great job hyping up the not-so-popular topic of male fertility,” she said. But then, almost in the same breath, she added with a laugh, “I might regret this in the morning,” hinting at the tension between medical legitimacy and whatever exactly this was.Surprisingly, Sperm Racing did make a small effort to honor its mission of getting people to think more critically about sperm health. During the “weigh-in”—a segment modeled after the macho theatrics of a boxing press conference—Sabourin stood on stage asking competitors actual health questions: how much they exercise, whether they smoke or drink. And to their credit, the men answered with a degree of sincerity, mentioning better sleep, cleaner diets, and cutting back on weed and booze.Courtesy Jason RogersBoat and his crew during the weigh-in.That earnestness, however, didn’t stand a chance against the event’s dominant vibe: full-blown internet id. Zhang, one of the first racers, had taken the stage flanked by a crew dressed like semen—matching white outfits, just like the guy in the VIP section from earlier—and wearing a plastic paintball vest scrawled with “Nut King” in Sharpie. Boat, his competitor, had arrived in silky purple pajamas, backed by an entourage dressed in black, some dripping in diamond chains. When the two stood nose to nose, Zhang pulled out a squirt gun and blasted Boat with a stream of mysterious white liquid, kicking off a pseudo-wrestling brawl that had me waiting for someone to yell “Worldstar!” After it was broken up, I turned to Annie—the goth girl with the chrome grills—for her take. She shrugged again: “Probably staged.”Later, when Proeger from UCLA and Wilcher from USC took the stage in NASCAR-style driver suits, the energy shifted from chaotic anticipation to full-blown college rivalry. Proeger, blonde and cherubic, was immediately booed by the USC crowd. Wilcher, with dark curls and a calm demeanor, stood by as Proeger fired back at the hecklers, telling them they “could not get into UCLA” and that they were all “micro dicks.” Soon after, members of Zhang’s crew—the ones dressed in white bodysuits—began simulating masturbation alongside a guy in an inflatable penis suit. At one point, a tall, slender “spokesman” bounded onstage and declared, “Sperm Racing is a serious company” before promptly dropping his pants.The event also felt like a YouTube echo chamber. About half the attendees I met identified as “content creators”—crews of boys chasing after each other with vlogging rigs and radiating the kind of energy that says “we’re here to get kicked out.” When I spoke to one of them, a handsome guy with face tattoos, his crew swung their rig around to film the interaction and, for a moment, I wasn’t sure who was interviewing whom.The slapdash execution didn’t help. A/V glitches and botched intros had already delayed the night. And, somehow, Zhu had booked Ty Dolla $ign to perform but after five minutes and a few half songs, the artist told the DJ to turn the music off and stormed off stage. Zhu later told me that someone from the press stuck a camera in his face, and he wasn’t having it.And, despite all that, I was enjoying myself. When it came time for the first, do-or-die race, Boat and Zhang returned to the stage and were directed to step into cylindrical glass tanks with tubes snaking upward toward fluid containers overhead. I was briefly puzzled—until I had a flashback to childhood afternoons watching Double Dare, where contestants can slime each other from above. Except in this case, the looming question was…is that going to be semen? Courtesy Jason RogersZhang in the dunk tank during the race. At center stage, two bearded guys—one in a black hoodie, the other in a white lab coat—used a heavy-duty pipette to deposit the samples onto the track, officially starting the race. The crowd, now about 500 strong, erupted as they stared up at the jumbotron, which supposedly displayed actual spermatozoa wiggling down parallel, curved tracks that looked like a top-down view of a Mario Kart circuit. Zhang’s swimmers shot ahead almost immediately, taking a commanding lead.“Noah’s swimmers aren’t even on the screen!” a hyped-up commentator screeched into the mic. “This is a microscopic masterclass!”Occasionally, the race looked a little off, with the sperm groupings suddenly surging forward, then stalling. Still, it was exciting to watch, and as Zhang’s top racer swam across the finish line, the crowd erupted and the dunk tank triggered, releasing gallons of white goop over Boat’s head. To his credit, Boat took it in stride. After drying off, he returned to the stage. “At the end of the day, we’re all winners,” he said, a towel slung over his shoulders. “And I definitely need to go see a doctor.”The Wilcher vs. Proeger matchup was no less thrilling. In the best-of-three-series, Wilcher took home the first win. Then in the second, Proeger stormed back to even the series. As the final race kicked off, I found myself glued to the mega-screen, as both competitors remained dead even, their swimmers jockeying for position in tight formation.“They are neck and neck. Or should I say tip to tip!” shouted the over-hyped commentator from earlier, clearly thrilled with what was probably his hundredth phallic pun of the night.Courtesy Jason RogersThe spermfetti. Despite the weird little glitches in the livestream, the tension held through the end. Every surge by one racer was matched by the other, the groups of swimmers darting forward in perfect sync. It felt, briefly, like watching the final stretch of the Kentucky Derby—if the horses were microscopic and had long flagellating tails.In a photo finish, Wilcher’s spermatozoon crossed the line first, taking home the victory and triggering the splash tank, which covered Proeger with an even bigger load of thick, white goop. Wilcher emerged from his tank dry, jogging to center stage, arms raised in victory. As “Congratulations” by Post Malone blasted over the speakers, blooms of confetti rained from the sky.Just before Wilcher received his $10,000 prize, which turned out to be a black briefcase stuffed with crisp, bound $1 bills, Zhu appeared on stage wearing a headset, looking like a behind the scenes operator in full command. I picked a piece of confetti from the floor and realized it was shaped like sperm. THE FOLLOWING WEEK, I spoke to Zhu, who told me he’d spent the last few days catching up on many hours of lost sleep. But as tired as he was, he still spoke like someone operating at 2x speed—rapid-fire, animated, bouncing between topics like tabs on a browser.“I thought it was a shit show,” he said, pre-empting the 10 or so questions I’d prepared about the more chaotic aspects of the show, like the brawl, the A/V glitches, and Ty Dolla $ign’s swift exit. “The only thing that worked well was the race.”He even anticipated my question about whether the races were real, switching our call to FaceTime video so he could show me how the raw footage of the sperm was converted into the on-screen animation. The weird fast-forwarding effect, he insisted, was the result of the mechanics of the microscopic racetrack whose fluid periodically pushed dead sperm up toward the live racers. Other reporting, however, claims that Zhu admitted the winners were known in advance because the races were recorded an hour earlier and the order was rearranged to make things “more interesting.” The Sperm Racing Instagram account posted an explanatory Instagram video in which Fan—Zhu’s height measuring co-founder—defends Sperm Racing. But he does not address the question of predetermination, saying only that the event is “not a fraud.” Courtesy Jason RogersThe first of three races between Tristan and Asher. Talking to Zhu was a surreal experience because in one moment he’d say something like, “We basically hate money,” giggling like the goofy teenager he still sort of is. And then, in another, he’d tell me how he had to make sure Sperm Racing wasn’t too NSFW because his tech companies “work a lot with the government.” He told me he made no money from the event (and presumably, neither did his investors). “Vegas next,” Zhu said when I asked what he had in store for Sperm Racing. “Or maybe even bigger, like the Olympics?”Zhu’s smirk as he made the final absurd projection reminded me that Sperm Racing is a perfect example of the tightrope his generation is walking: the push for meaning and legitimacy, while navigating a culture where attention is currency and truth is negotiable.It’s unlikely that this is the last we're going to see of Zhu’s creation. A few days after we spoke, Zhu posted a story on Instagram, saying that he’d “raised a new round” of funding—though he wouldn’t share more details, only that it would be announced soon. If the “sport” does continue to grow, he will have to deal with the critics who say Sperm Racing is fake. So, Zhu might need that slick TV attorney after all—although, most likely to negotiate his Netflix deal.Jason Rogers is an Olympic medalist and LA-based writer whose work focuses on the evolving state of masculinity.

      "Sending converted contents format: [{'role': 'user', 'parts': [{'text': 'You are an expert news analyst AI tasked with refining a set of automatically generated news clusters. You will receive a list of clusters, each identified by an ID, a title, and a list of associated article titles.\\n\\nYour primary goal is to identify clusters that should be **merged** because they represent different facets or developments of the *same core story or event*, rather than distinct narratives. Use the following rule of thumb: **\"If analyzing the articles in Cluster A would feel incomplete or artificially separated from the articles in Cluster B because they fundamentally describe the same specific event, ongoing situation, or central topic, they should be merged.\"**\\n\\nDistinguish this from clusters that are merely *related* thematically but cover different specific events, angles, or sub-topics that *can* stand alone as separate stories, even if they might be linked later in analysis. For example:\\n\\n*   **Merge Candidate Example:** Cluster 1 covers the initial report of a factory fire. Cluster 2 covers the emergency response and evacuation related to *that same fire*. Cluster 3 covers the investigation into the cause of *that same fire*. These are facets of the *same core story* (the factory fire event) and should likely be merged.\\n*   **Keep Separate Example:** Cluster 1 covers a new trade agreement signed between Country X and Country Y. Cluster 2 covers protests *within* Country X about the economic impact of *that trade agreement*. While related, the signing event and the domestic protest are distinct stories/angles that could be analyzed separately. Cluster 3 covers a *different* trade dispute Country X has with Country Z – clearly a separate story.\\n\\nYour secondary goal is to identify clusters that should be **filtered out** before further processing. **Filtering should be used sparingly**, primarily to remove noise and maintain data quality, not to judge the importance of a story. The aim is to retain a record of all distinct, coherent events, even routine or smaller ones. Filter *only* if a cluster meets one of these specific criteria:\\n*   **Very Low Article Count:** Contains **fewer than 3 articles**, indicating it likely doesn\\'t represent a sufficiently developed or distinct event captured in the data.\\n*   **Incoherent or Noise:** The articles within the cluster do not form a coherent topic, or the cluster appears to be noise/junk data.\\n*   **Strict Duplicate:** The cluster covers the *exact same specific event* as another cluster, often with significant overlap in articles, making it redundant. (Do not filter merely *related* clusters).\\n*   **Clearly Irrelevant:** The content is demonstrably not related to news events (e.g., advertisements, site navigation links clustered together).\\n\\n**Input Format:**\\n\\nThe input will be structured text as follows:\\n\\n```\\n# ID: [Cluster ID 1] - [Cluster Title 1]\\n  - [Article Title 1a]\\n  - [Article Title 1b]\\n  ...\\n\\n# ID: [Cluster ID 2] - [Cluster Title 2]\\n  - [Article Title 2a]\\n  - [Article Title 2b]\\n  ...\\n\\n[... more clusters ...]\\n```\\n*(Note: Cluster IDs in the input might be strings or numbers, please preserve them as strings in the JSON output).*\\n\\n**Output Requirements:**\\n\\nYour output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON object containing two keys: `merges` and `filters`.\\n\\n1.  **`merges`**: An array of objects.

    "You are an expert news analyst AI tasked with refining a set of automatically generated news clusters. You will receive a list of clusters, each identified by an ID, a title, and a list of associated article titles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your primary goal is to identify clusters that should be **merged** because they represent different facets or developments of the *same core story or event*, rather than distinct narratives. Use the following rule of thumb: **\"If analyzing the articles in Cluster A would feel incomplete or artificially separated from the articles in Cluster B because they fundamentally describe the same specific event, ongoing situation, or central topic, they should be merged.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "Distinguish this from clusters that are merely *related* thematically but cover different specific events, angles, or sub-topics that *can* stand alone as separate stories, even if they might be linked later in analysis. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Merge Candidate Example:** Cluster 1 covers the initial report of a factory fire. Cluster 2 covers the emergency response and evacuation related to *that same fire*. Cluster 3 covers the investigation into the cause of *that same fire*. These are facets of the *same core story* (the factory fire event) and should likely be merged.\n",
    "*   **Keep Separate Example:** Cluster 1 covers a new trade agreement signed between Country X and Country Y. Cluster 2 covers protests *within* Country X about the economic impact of *that trade agreement*. While related, the signing event and the domestic protest are distinct stories/angles that could be analyzed separately. Cluster 3 covers a *different* trade dispute Country X has with Country Z – clearly a separate story.\n",

    "Your secondary goal is to identify clusters that should be **filtered out** before further processing. **Filtering should be used sparingly**, primarily to remove noise and maintain data quality, not to judge the importance of a story. The aim is to retain a record of all distinct, coherent events, even routine or smaller ones. Filter *only* if a cluster meets one of these specific criteria:\n",
    "*   **Very Low Article Count:** Contains **fewer than 3 articles**, indicating it likely doesn't represent a sufficiently developed or distinct event captured in the data.\n",
    "*   **Incoherent or Noise:** The articles within the cluster do not form a coherent topic, or the cluster appears to be noise/junk data.\n",
    "*   **Strict Duplicate:** The cluster covers the *exact same specific event* as another cluster, often with significant overlap in articles, making it redundant. (Do not filter merely *related* clusters).\n",

    "**Detailed Instructions for JSON Fields:**\n",
    "*   **`status`**: 'complete' or 'incomplete'\n",
    "*   **`title`**: Terse, neutral title of the story\n",
    "*   **`executiveSummary`**: Provide a 2-4 sentence concise summary highlighting the most critical developments, key conflicts, and overall assessment from the articles. This should be suitable for a quick read in a daily brief.\n",
    "*   **`storyStatus`**: Assess the current state of the story's development based *only* on the information in the articles. Use one of: 'Developing', 'Escalating', 'De-escalating', 'Concluding', 'Static'.\n",
    "*   **`timeline`**: List key events in chronological order.\n",
    "    *   `description`: Keep descriptions brief and factual.\n",
    "    *   `importance`: Assess the event's importance to understanding the overall narrative (High/Medium/Low). High importance implies the event is central to the story's development or outcome.\n",
    "*   **`signalStrength`**: Assess the overall reliability of the reporting *in this cluster*.\n",
    "    *   `assessment`: Use a qualitative term: 'Very High', 'High', 'Moderate', 'Low', 'Very Low'.\n",
    "    *   `reasoning`: Justify the assessment based on source corroboration (how many sources report the same core facts?), source quality/reliability (mix of reputable vs. biased sources?), presence of official statements, and degree of conflicting information on core facts.\n",
    "*   **`undisputedKeyFacts`**: List core factual points that are corroborated across multiple, generally reliable sources within the cluster. Avoid claims made only by highly biased sources unless corroborated.\n",
    "*   **`keyEntities`**: Identify the main actors.\n",
    "    *   `list`: Provide basic identification and their role/involvement.\n",
    "    *   `perspectives.statedPositions`: Focus *only* on the goals, viewpoints, or justifications explicitly stated or clearly implied by the entity *as reported in the articles*. Avoid listing conflicting claims here (that goes in `contradictions`).\n",
    "*   **`keySources`**: Analyze the provided news sources.\n",
    "    *   `provided_articles_sources.reliabilityAssessment`: Assess the source's general reliability based on reputation, known biases (political, state affiliation, ideological), and fact-checking standards. Use terms like 'High Reliability', 'Moderate Reliability', 'Low Reliability', 'State-Affiliated/Propaganda Outlet'. Be specific about the *type* of bias.\n",
    "    *   `provided_articles_sources.framing`: Describe the narrative angle or style used by the source (e.g., 'Emphasizes security threat', 'Focuses on human rights angle', 'Uses neutral language', 'Uses loaded/emotional language', 'Presents government narrative uncritically').\n",
    "    *   `contradictions`: Detail specific points of disagreement *between sources* or *between entities as reported by sources*.\n",
    "        *   `issue`: Clearly state what is being contested.\n",
    "        *   `conflictingClaims`: List the different versions, specifying the `source` reporting it, the `claim` itself, and optionally the `entityClaimed` if the source attributes the claim to a specific entity. Critically evaluate claims originating solely from low-reliability/propaganda sources.\n",
    "*   **`context`**: List essential background information *mentioned or clearly implied in the articles* needed to understand the story.\n",
    "*   **`informationGaps`**: Identify crucial pieces of information *missing* from the articles that would be needed for a complete understanding.\n",
    "*   **`significance`**: Assess the overall importance of the reported events.\n",
    "    *   `assessment`: Use a qualitative term: 'Critical', 'High', 'Moderate', 'Low'.\n",
    "    *   `reasoning`: Explain *why* this story matters. Consider immediate impact, potential future developments, strategic implications, precedent setting, regional/global relevance.\n",

Lyon’s performance in the quarter-final second leg, in which they scored four, will give Athletic Club hope, but there will surely be opportunities for United to score the one goal needed to effectively end the tie.Man Utd 2-2 Athletic ClubHead to head (h2h) history and resultsMan Utd wins: 2Athletic Club wins: 3Draws: 0Manchester United vs Athletic Club match oddsMan Utd to reach final: 1/250Athletic Club to reach final: 20/1Odds via Betfair (subject to change).\\n```\\n\\n## [Bodo/Glimt vs Tottenham: Europa League prediction, kick-off time, team news, TV, live stream, h2h, odds today](https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/bodo-glimt-vs-tottenham-prediction-kick-off-time-latest-team-news-tv-live-stream-h2h-results-odds-europa-league-2025-preview-today-b1226130.html) (#52763)\\n\\n> 2025-05-08 06:12:45+00:00\\n\\n```\\nA 3-1 semi-final first-leg victory puts Spurs firmly in the driving seat to reach their first European showpiece in six years, but the hosts’ artificial pitch could prove a real leveller this evening.Glimt’s home record is impressive, and Spurs will have to raise their standards again if they are to avoid a humbling comeback.The absence of both James Maddison and Lucas Bergvall will be keenly felt, two players who would have started the game, as Spurs look to again keep their season alive for one more game.Date, kick-off time and venueBodo/Glimt vs Tottenham is scheduled for an 8pm BST kick-off tonight, Thursday, May 8, 2025.The match will take place at Aspmyra Stadion in the Norwegian town of Bodo, located north of the Arctic Circle.Bodo/Glimt fans inside the Aspmyra StadionGetty ImagesWhere to watch Bodo/Glimt vs TottenhamTV channel: In the UK, the game will be televised live on TNT Sports 2, with coverage starting at 7pm BST.Live stream: TNT Sports subscribers can also catch the contest live online via the Discovery+ app and website.Live blog: You can follow all the action on matchday via Standard Sport’s live blog, with expert analysis from Dan Kilpatrick at the ground.Bodo/Glimt vs Tottenham team newsBodo/Glimt will be able to call upon Andreas Helmersen, Patrick Berg and Hakon Evjen, who were all suspended for the first leg. Key defender Odin Bjortuft, who missed the first leg through injury, will be assessed ahead of the game.Dejan Kulusevski is likely to come in for the second leg, having started the first on the bench, while Wilson Odobert is pushing to start after scoring against West Ham at the weekend.James Maddison has been ruled out for the rest of the seasonGetty ImagesBodo/Glimt vs Tottenham predictionMuch has been made of Glimt’s artificial pitch, and rightly so. Their record in front of their own fans cannot be ignored; just one defeat in seven in the competition this season with a +11 goal difference. Spurs’ only other experience of playing on an artificial pitch this season saw them taken to extra time in the FA Cup by non-league Tamworth.Their late first-leg consolation will give Glimt real hope of completing a stunning comeback, and an early goal in the second leg could really put the frighteners into the Spurs squad. Ange Postecoglou will be telling his players to likely keep it tight for the opening stages, gaps will open up as the hosts push for the goals they need. One Spurs goal could kill the tie.Bodo/Glimt 2-1 TottenhamHead to head (h2h) history and resultsGlimt and Spurs have met just once before, in last week’s semi-final first leg in north London, which the English side won 3-1.Bodo/Glimt vs Tottenham match oddsBodo/Glimt to reach final: 7/1Tottenahm to reach final: 1/14Odds via Betfair (subject to change).\\n```\\n\\n## [Man United handed major boost as key Athletic Bilbao trio are ruled out of Europa League semi-final...](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-14686647/Man-United-handed-major-boost-key-Athletic-Bilbao-trio-ruled-Europa-League-semi-final-clash-Old-Trafford.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490) (#52911)\\n\\n> 2025-05-07 20:25:11+00:00\\n\\n```\\n09:49, 07 May 2025, updated\\n21:25, 07 May 2025\\nBy\\nSAM BROOKES\\nAthletic Bilbao have released their squad list for tomorrow night\\'s matchThey will be without three key players for their match with United at Old TraffordLISTEN NOW: It\\'s All Kicking Off!

Arsenal need to sign players for the here and now to win the Premier League... so, should they sign Harry Kane?\\nThe green rectangle of plastic grass glistened with no hint of the demons said to be lurking within and the Bodo/Glimt players fizzed passes about on a surface slick with Arctic drizzle.Around them, workers were busy adorning the Aspmyra Stadium with the final trimmings for its biggest night, fixing UEFA branding in the appropriate areas and running TV cables around the simple stands.Beyond that, the stillness of a Norwegian fishing town where day broke at 3am, the calls of the gulls, the rumble of a tractor spreading rubber crumb over an artificial training pitch and the occasional fighter jet tearing through the sky on a training exercise.Little else stirred in Bodo as Tottenham descended. The Champions League determined its two finalists amid the trembling passion of the San Siro and Parc des Princes. There will be 80,000 inside Old Trafford willing Manchester United to beat Athletic Bilbao.Here, the anticipation came with a little Scandinavian understatement. With yellow flags on display outside buildings, fluttering from lampposts, on display in the windows of shops and porches.\\'It is a historic football match and we want the main role,\\' said Bodo/Glimt boss Kjetil Knutsen. His team trail 3-1 after the first leg but a late goal in London fuelled hope and they have faith in the Aspmyra with its League Two vibe and capacity of 8,000. \\'We are at home, we have the town behind us,\\' Knutsen added. Spurs are gearing up for their crucial Europa League semi-final second leg against Bodo/Glimt Ange Postecoglou\\'s Tottenham are taking a 3-1 aggregate lead into the second leg in Norway Spurs will play at Bodo/Glimt\\'s Aspmyra Stadium (above), which has an artificial surface Midfielder Jens Petter Hauge, who joined AC Milan from Bodo in 2020 and won the Europa League with Eintracht Frankfurt before returning to his hometown club last year, said: \\'No matter where you go or who you meet, in the garage or the mall, everyone is looking forward to it and everyone says they\\'ve tried to get tickets and it\\'s impossible.\\'Tottenham dominated last week and were worth their lead, despite disparaging post-match comments from Bodo right-back Fredrik Sjovold who claimed the Premier League team\\'s attempts to press them into mistakes were \\'ræva\\', meaning \\'very bad\\' in its most polite translation, and that he had played against better in Norwegian football.Knutsen brushed it aside, putting it down to Sjovold\\'s \\'inexperience\\' and yet it has become a talking point in Norway, where there is a feeling that Ange Postecoglou\\'s team were nothing special and are now without James Maddison, ruled out for three months with a knee injury he suffered in the first leg.Bodo, with key players including captain Patrick Berg back from suspension, believe they are not out of this tie, especially if they score first in the Aspmyra, where the home record is so formidable.In 10 home ties in this European campaign, which started in July in the Champions League qualifiers, the Norwegian champions have won nine, including victories against established clubs such as Lazio, Olympiacos, Twente, Besiktas and Red Star. Three years ago, they beat Roma 6-1 after knocking out Postecoglou\\'s Celtic.The artificial pitch has been criticised, and Knutsen hit back, saying: \\'We are a good football team first and foremost. Like most teams, we are better at home than away. The grass we have is what we play on. It\\'s due to the climate. And the more you play on it the better you get. At home, over time, we have learned to trust in ourselves. It\\'s a good pitch and good players can easily adapt.\\'The last time Tottenham played on an artificial pitch was in the FA Cup at Tamworth, when they needed extra-time to see off fifth-tier opposition, and Postecoglou opted against using artificial surfaces at the training ground before travelling to Norway, claiming there was little point because they were all different.Goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario, who didn\\'t play at Tamworth, said it was probably five years since he played on one, but nobody appeared too perturbed as they trained in Bodo last night. Bodo/Glimt\\'s record at home has been formidable and they won\\'t think they\\'re out of the tie Postecoglou vowed that his side are fazed by the pitch, atmosphere or conditions in Norway The Spurs boss will be without James Maddison, who is ruled out for the rest of the season The story behind Bodo/Glimt\\'s name Bodo is the name of the town in northern Norway and Glimt means flash.\\xa0When they were formed in 1916 they were simply known as Glimt but added the Bodo in the middle of the 20th Century because another team had the same nickname.\\xa0Originally, they used a dash between the words but changed it to the unique forward slash because the dash led to confusion when the fixtures were printed on the pools.\\xa0Since their rise to international prominence after winning their first Norwegian title in 2020, Bodo/Glimt has become one of the most recognisable names in European football. \\'It\\'s obviously different,\\' said Postecoglou. \\'Whether it\\'s the pitch, the atmosphere, the conditions, there\\'s always challenges to overcome it, and we\\'ll do that.\\'Spurs can take comfort from the victory at Eintracht Frankfurt in the quarter final and the knowledge they are inching closer to a first major trophy since 2008, and a ticket to rejoin Europe\\'s elite.And Postecoglou was undeterred by former Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, now FIFA\\'s chief of global football development, who claimed the Europa League winners should not go into the Champions League as they have for the last 10 years.\\'Spurs does crazy things to people,\\' scoffed Postecoglou.\\xa0\\'Put that club into any sentence and invariably they all come out and try to diminish us as much as they can. Why wasn\\'t it an issue before but it is now? \\'Last year, fifth didn\\'t get you into the Champions League and now it does. What does that mean? There are competition rules and it\\'s not the first year. I\\'ve got great respect for Arsene, he\\'s one of the legends of the game but Spurs does crazy things to people, I love it.\\'Predicted Spurs XI (4-3-3): Vicario; Porro, Romero, Van de Ven, Udogie; Bissouma, Bentancur, Kulusevski; Johnson, Solanke, Richarlison\\n```\\n\\n## [The Tipster: Tottenham can reach Europa League final despite defeat in Bodo/Glimt.](https://metro.co.uk/2025/05/07/tottenham-can-reach-europa-league-final-sunny-spain-despite-defeat-bodo-glimt-arctic-circle-23040846/) (#53040)\\n\\n> 2025-05-07 11:16:08+00:00\\n\\n```\\nDejan Kulusevski can turn up trumps for Spurs against Bodo/Glimt (Picture: Getty Images)\\nTottenham’s season is on a knife edge as they head to the Arctic Circle bidding to book their trip to sunny Bilbao later this month for the Europa League final.\\nAnge Postecoglou’s Premier League underachievers take a 3-1 lead into the semi-final, second leg, which will be played on the artificial surface at the Aspmyra Stadion in front of less than 500 supporters from north London, and Spurs have been absolutely shocking on their travels this term.\\nThey have won just twice away from N17 in their last ten matches in all competitions – losing seven – but tellingly one of those victories was the 1-0 quarter-final success in Frankfurt which kept them on track to win their first silverware since their League Cup triumph 17 years ago.\\nTheir hosts, Bodo/Glimt have chiselled out a reputation for being formidable opponents on home plastic and have scored 15 goals in their last five matches in front of their own fans in Europe.\\nThat would be enough to overturn their first-leg deficit and send them to a sensational success while pouring further misery on Tottenham fans who will be fretting over the return of their club’s injury crisis with key midfielders James Maddison and Lucas Bergvall both ruled out.\\nGet personalised updates on Manchester United every day\\nWake up to find news on your club in your inbox every morning with Metro’s Football Newsletter.\\nSign up to our newsletter and then select your team in the link so we can send you football news tailored to you.\\nHowever, while they have kept just one clean sheet in their last 15 matches in all competitions – again, at Frankfurt – Tottenham usually find a way to score and have done so in each of their last eight outings.\\nThe absence of injured midfielder James Maddison in Norway is a big blow for Tottenham (Picture: Getty Images)\\nDespite the injuries, there are enough quality players in the Tottenham ranks to ensure they ease into the final against either Athletic Bilbao or, almost certainly, Manchester United and while Bodo/Glimt are worth siding with to triumph on the night at 7/4 with Sky Bet, Spurs are no better than 1/10 with William Hill and others to qualify and a 2-1 defeat, which would see them go through, is 9/1 with multiple firms.\\nDejan Kulusevski has not hit the highs he was enjoying before being sidelined through injury but he can smash in that all-important goal to ease Tottenham nerves at 7/2 with Paddy Power and Betfred.\\nUnited, 3-0 up after the first leg in Spain, have also been largely dismal in the league this season but they can also afford to lose and reach the final.\\nBilbao, who had a player sent off early in the first leg and are beset by injuries, are 13/5 with Paddy Power, Bet Victor and Betfair to win on the night and 12/1 with bet365 to win 2-1.\\n• Sheffield United are 9/5 with Paddy Power and Betfair to win the first leg of their Championship play-off semi-final with Bristol City at Ashton Gate.\\n• Cries of ‘fore’ rather than ‘four’ will be heard around the Philadelphia Cricket Club this week as the PGA Tour’s Truist Champions takes place on its Wissahickon Golf Course – standing in for Quail Hollow as it prepares to host next week’s PGA Championship major.\\nDefending champion Rory McIlroy will still be buzzing after his Masters success at Augusta and is 5/1 with BetMGM and Unibet to retain his crown while Corey Conners, Sam Burns and Aaron Rai are our respective each-way bets at 25/1, 40/1 and 45/1 with Ladbrokes and Coral.\\nArrow\\nMORE: Stephen Hendry reckons one player will be fuming with Zhao Xintong’s World Championship win\\nArrow\\nMORE: Benjamin Sesko responds to Arsenal transfer interest as release clause increases\\nArrow\\nMORE: What’s wrong with Martin Odegaard?

Limited time offer >An all-English final is in prospect should Tottenham Hotspur defeat Bodo/Glimt, giving the sides 15th and 16th in the Premier League at present a chance to win a continental trophy, with the considerable added bonus of qualifying for the Champions League.“In the end of this season, we can be the worst (United) team in Premier League history with a European title, so it will change nothing,” Amorim told reporters on Wednesday.“We know that this season was really disappointing for everybody. Nothing is going to change,” added United manager Amorim, who took charge of the fallen English giants after replacing the sacked Erik ten Hag in November.United may be well-placed but Amorim believes they must guard against their tendency to “lose our mind a little bit” if they are to reach a final that will be played at Bilbao’s San Mames ground on May 21.Ruben Amorim, Manager of Manchester United. Photo by Alex Livesey/Getty ImagesSource: Getty ImagesCasemiro’s header and two goals from skipper Bruno Fernandes in Bilbao put them in a strong position in Spain, with the hosts reduced to 10 men following Dani Vivian’s red card.All 133 teams in the competition’s history to have scored three or more goals away from home in the first leg have gone through.But Amorim is taking nothing for granted and believes United must score at least one more goal to book their place in the final.“If you look at our season, anything is possible, so we have to understand one goal can change anything, the momentum of the game,” he said.“One sending off, you saw it a week ago, so we are prepared to fight to win the game not thinking about the result.“Of course that matters and the way we are going to do things, especially when we start the game, but of course we are thinking about winning the game.”Athletic face a tough task, but United have lost 3-0 at Old Trafford three times so far this season and were beaten 4-3 at Brentford last weekend.“I feel that we need to score to go to the next round, so that is clearly the way we are going to face the game,” Amorim said.Athletic boss Ernesto Valverde insisted his side still have a chance of a stunning victory despite the absence of four key players.Vivian is suspended after his first leg red card, while Nico and Inaki Williams have been ruled out through injury, along with top scorer Oihan Sancet.“There’s no point thinking about the ones who aren’t here. We know we’ve got some key injuries, but it’s about the ones who are on the field tomorrow,” Valverde said.“They’re the ones who will be trying to turn this tie around. It’s not going to be easy. We also know how high quality our opponents are and their stadium, but this is football. Anything can happen.“That’s what we always hope for, and we’re hoping for the best like we always do.”\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

The evidence shows the UK is a hub for pioneering research, with one in eight trials testing humans for the first time, and cutting-edge treatments such as gene therapies becoming a new growth area.But a review of the data by the Guardian found that women were significantly under-represented. Both sexes were included in most trials (90%), but male-only trials (6.1%) were nearly twice as common as female-only studies (3.7%). Pregnant and breastfeeding women were especially under-represented – involved in just 1.1% and 0.6% of trials respectively.Women’s health experts expressed alarm over the figures, which they said meant women and their doctors were having to make decisions about whether to take a drug in a “vacuum of evidence”. Some areas of research are dominated by men at all levels – funders, researchers, consultants and patients – and as a result there could be a “reluctance” to fund female-only trials, the experts added.Dr Amy Brenner, an assistant professor in the clinical trials unit at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), said: “It is particularly concerning that there are more male-only trials than female-only trials as, while they may be disease-specific, it is certainly not true that there are more male-only than female-only diseases.”The gender gap had serious implications, Brenner said. “This under-representation means there is a lack of evidence on the safety and effectiveness of many interventions in women.” There was an “urgent need” to correct the disparity in order to improve women’s health outcomes, she added.Beyond the under-representation of women in general, the absence of pregnant and breastfeeding women in UK clinical trials was also “problematic”, Brenner said. This may be in part because of safety concerns and a “likely reluctance” to put babies at risk, she said. “However, without trials in these populations these women will continue to miss out on possible beneficial treatments”The Guardian reviewed the data from a study led by the MHRA and the University of Liverpool, which collected details of all 4,616 clinical trials submitted to the MHRA between 2019 and 2023.Cancer trials dominated, making up nearly a third of all studies, but other major conditions lagged behind. Heart disease – the world’s biggest killer – received just 5.2% of research focus. Reproductive and childbirth trials made up only 2.2% of the total.Trials for conditions such as chronic pain, respiratory conditions and mental health disorders were among the least common, despite their significant impact on public health.Patients aged 65 or above made up 67.7% of participants. Cutting-edge treatments, such as gene and cell therapies, represent a growing focus of research efforts but still represent only 3.4% of trials, despite their potential to transform care for patients with limited treatment options.The Guardian found the number of male-only trials (282) was 67% higher than female-only trials (169), and pregnant and breastfeeding women took part in only about one in 100 medical studies.Prof Anna David, the director of the EGA Institute for Women’s Health at UCL, said the “important” findings helped explained why so few new treatments for women’s health issues were emerging, and why some women “are not getting the care they need”.“There is this perception that women, pregnant women and breastfeeding women do not want to participate in clinical trials and therefore they are usually not considered as potential participants, even in phase 3 clinical trials. This is not the case.”She added: “Women and their healthcare providers are therefore having to make decisions about whether to take a drug in a vacuum of evidence, which is not ethical.”David was especially concerned that only 2.2% of trials focused on reproductive and childbirth issues. “Pregnancy conditions such as pre-eclampsia, preterm labour, and placental insufficiency leading to foetal growth restriction are major diseases with no current treatments,” she said.Prof Andrea Manfrin, the MHRA’s deputy director of clinical investigations and trials, said there was a “notable imbalance” between male-only and female-only trials. “When specific groups are not adequately represented in trials, it creates evidence gaps about how medicines work for them.”The MHRA was working with trial sponsors, researchers and ethics committees to promote studies that “better reflect” the population, she said. “Increasing diversity in clinical trials is a priority for us at the MHRA. We are committed to supporting inclusive, safe and scientifically robust research across the UK.”Brenner said the key to increasing the number of female-only trials, and the number of women taking part in trials more generally, was involving more women in the early stages of their design.“In the LSHTM clinical trials unit we plan all trials with patient and public involvement, involving patients, carers and the public in designing and running trials,” he said. “Ensuring strong representation from women in these groups is a first step to understanding barriers and increasing women’s participation in trials.”The health minister Karin Smyth said the government was determined to make the UK a world leader in life sciences, developing groundbreaking new treatments “focused on the conditions that matter most to patients”. The science minister Lord Vallance said: “We must make sure that trials of new medicines are available to everyone to take part.”\\n```\\n\\n## [The Guardian view on bias in medical research: disregard for women’s health belongs in the past](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/07/the-guardian-view-on-bias-in-medical-research-disregard-for-womens-health-belongs-in-the-past) (#47713)\\n\\n> 2025-05-07 18:15:09+00:00\\n\\n```\\nSix years after Caroline Criado Perez’s bestselling book Invisible Women drew a mass readership’s attention to the long history of sexist bias in medical research, it is shocking that women and their illnesses are still underrepresented in clinical trials. Analysis by the Guardian of data gathered for a new study showed that from 2019 to 2023, 282 trials involving only male subjects were submitted for regulatory approval in the UK – compared with 169 focused on women.Health inequality is a complex and multifaceted problem. There are massive socioeconomic differences\\xa0in life expectancy and infant mortality, as\\xa0well as race inequalities – for example, in maternity and mental illnesses. These and other disparities, along\\xa0with those relating to disability, can also be mapped geographically.Women, on average, live longer than men, so in this\\xa0sense men can be said to be disadvantaged. But in addition to the risks associated with pregnancy and\\xa0childbirth, far more women have dementia, while\\xa0survival rates from female- and male-specific cancers – and other diseases that affect the sexes differently – are highly variable.The five-year period in this study, which was carried out by the University of Liverpool and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), was not necessarily typical. It does not reveal how funding was divided up. But taking on board these caveats, it is hard to see a benign explanation for there being 67% more trials investigating men’s health than women’s. This gap in research inputs could reasonably be expected to contribute to a disparity in outcomes further down the line.This is all the more disappointing given recent progress in tackling women’s exclusion from health research. For decades, as Ms Criado Perez and others have documented, many clinical trials were conducted on male subjects only. Researchers preferred to avoid what they saw as complications associated with the female reproductive system, especially pregnancy – although experts now regard concerns that women’s hormones might skew results as having been wrong.Ninety per cent of the UK trials in the MHRA study involved both sexes. It is not possible to compare this precisely with past practice, as the data has not been scrutinised in the same way before. But increased recognition of the variable effects of medicines on males and females has led regulators and funders to change their policies. In the US, the National Institutes of Health has required investigators to consider sex as a variable since 2016. In the UK, the Medical Research Council changed its rules in 2022. Since then, experiments conducted on animals have been expected to include both sexes – with limited exceptions (such as when the condition being studied affects one sex only).The lack of medical research on pregnant women came to the fore during the pandemic, when many were unvaccinated and alarming numbers ended up in intensive care. Reluctance to test drugs on pregnant women is often linked to the thalidomide scandal of the 1960s, when thousands of babies were damaged by a drug given to their mothers for morning sickness. But while caution may be merited, among pregnant women themselves as well as researchers, there is no shortage of women who are not pregnant. The disparity in sex-specific research points to an anti-female bias. Ministers, funders, hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry should all be concerned.\\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They appeared to include a boy selling coffee, two parents and their young son, and a market vendor sitting by his small stall.Palestinian journalist Yahya Sobeih was also killed, colleagues said, only hours after his wife gave birth to their first child.In another video, the owner of the nearby Palmyra restaurant, Abu Saleh Abdu, said many children, elderly people and passersby were killed. Addressing the Israeli military, he asked: \"What do [you] want to achieve? You haven\\'t bombed any fighters or any weapons. You\\'ve only hit civilians.\"The Thailandy restaurant was destroyed during last year\\'s Israeli ground operation at the nearby al-Shifa hospital, but it had been rebuilt recently using tents and makeshift structures.In addition to selling basic meals, the restaurant was also preparing hundreds of hot meals daily for humanitarian organisations to distribute to poor and displaced people.Gaza\\'s Hamas-run Government Media Office accused the Israeli military of committing war crimes by \"deliberately targeting gatherings of civilians and displaced people\" in four separate incidents over 24 hours.AFPHamas accused the Israeli military of deliberately targeting gatherings of civiliansWomen and children were among 33 people who were killed when the UN-run Abu Humeisa school in Bureij refugee camp, in central Gaza, was bombed twice on Tuesday, according to the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency.Witness Ali al-Shaqra said on Wednesday that 300 families had been staying at the school and that the effect of the strike was like an \"earthquake\".The Israeli military said it struck \"terrorists who were operating within a Hamas command-and-control centre\".The military has not yet commented on a strike on the al-Karama school in the eastern Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City on Wednesday morning, which the Civil Defence said killed another 15 people.It comes amid international condemnation of Israel\\'s plans to expand and intensify its ground offensive against Hamas. Israeli officials have said they include seizing all of the territory indefinitely, forcibly displacing Palestinians to the south, and taking over aid distribution with private companies despite protests from the UN and its humanitarian partners.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that his security cabinet had decided on a \"forceful operation\" to destroy Hamas and rescue its remaining hostages. He said Gaza\\'s 2.1 million population \"will be moved, to protect it\", and that troops \"will not enter and come out\".Israel cut off all supplies to Gaza on 2 March and resumed its offensive two weeks later after the collapse of a two-month ceasefire, saying it was putting pressure on Hamas to release its 59 remaining hostages.The renewed Israeli strikes and ground operations have already resulted in hundreds of casualties and the displacement of an estimated 423,000 people, with about 70% of Gaza placed under Israeli evacuation orders, within an Israel-designated \"no-go\" zone, or both, according to the UN.Aid agencies have also warned that mass starvation is imminent unless the blockade ends.The UN has said Israel is obliged under international law to ensure food and medical supplies for Gaza\\'s population. Israel has said it is complying with international law and that there is no aid shortage because thousands of lorry loads entered Gaza during the ceasefire.ReutersPalestinians said a school-turned-shelter elsewhere in Gaza City was hit by an Israeli strike on Wednesday morningPalestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa, who is based in the occupied West Bank, told the BBC that the situation in Gaza was \"a real catastrophe\".\"This cannot continue. It\\'s a siege, famine. No water, no electricity, no hope,\" he said.Mustafa urged the international community to step up efforts to broker a new ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas as quickly as possible, warning: \"People are dying every day in Gaza, and this should not happen anymore.\"An Israeli official said on Monday that the expanded offensive would not begin until after US President Donald Trump\\'s visit to the region next week, providing what he called \"a window of opportunity\" to Hamas to agree a deal.However, a senior Hamas official Bassem Naim said on Tuesday that there was \"no point\" to negotiations while Israel continued what he called a \"starvation war\".The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.At least 52,653 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 2,545 since the Israeli offensive resumed, according to the territory\\'s health ministry.\\n```\\n\\n## [Women and children among 48 people killed in Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, say Palestinian health officials](https://news.sky.com/story/israeli-airstrikes-kill-48-and-injure-dozens-in-gaza-city-say-palestinian-health-officials-13363448) (#48010)\\n\\n> 2025-05-07 16:03:00+00:00\\n\\n```\\nAt least 48 people have been killed in Gaza following a series of Israeli airstrikes, according to local health officials.On Wednesday, 15 people died at the Karama School in Tuffah, a suburb of Gaza City, where displaced families were sheltering.\\nAnother strike killed at least 33 others, including women and children, near a crowded market and restaurant in the city.\\nImage:\\nPalestinians carry an injured woman after an Israeli airstrike in Gaza City.

But the BBC understands the report is accurate.Commander Dominic Murphy, head of the Metropolitan Police counter-terrorism command, said it was a \"fast-moving\" investigation and there were \"significant operational reasons\" why the force could not provide further details.Iran \"categorically rejects\" any involvement, said the Iranian foreign minister, Seyed Abbas Araghchi, on the social media site X.He added his country was ready to assist with the investigation. The men - two aged 29, a 40-year-old, a 24-year-old and another aged 46 - were arrested on Saturday over an alleged plan to target \"a specific premises\", the Met said. The men were arrested in Swindon, west London, Stockport, Rochdale and Manchester.Armed police descended on suspects across the country on SaturdayFour of the men are continuing to be questioned under the Terrorism Act. The fifth man, who was detained under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE), was released on bail until a date in May.Officers carried out searches at a number of addresses in Greater Manchester, London and Swindon as part of the investigation.

suspicion of preparing a terrorist act were allegedly targeting the Israeli embassy in London, according to reports.They were arrested at locations across England on Saturday after a suspected plot “to target a single premises” was uncovered, the Metropolitan Police said.The embassy in Kensington, west London, is understood to have been the target of the alleged plot, according to The Times and other press outlets, but police declined to share further details.Commander Dominic Murphy, head of the Met’s counter-terrorism command, said: “There are significant operational reasons why we cannot provide further information at this time.“As soon as possible we will look to share further details and in the meantime we would ask the public to remain vigilant and contact us if you have any concerns.”The Israeli embassy has been approached for comment.The five arrested were a 29-year-old man in the Swindon area, a 46-year-old man in west London, a 29-year-old man in the Stockport area, a 40-year-old man in the Rochdale area and a 24-year-old man in the Manchester area.The first four men were arrested on suspicion of preparation of a terrorist act, contrary to section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006, and the fifth was detained under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act.Warrants of further detention were secured on Monday for four of the men, with the 24-year-old released on bail with conditions to a date in May.Another three Iranian men were arrested on Saturday at three addresses in London as part of a separate counter-terrorism operation under section 27 of the National Security Act 2023.Security minister Dan Jarvis (Richard Townshend/UK Parliament/PA)PA MediaSecurity minister Dan Jarvis told the Commons on Tuesday the two operations that took place were

21:40:32+00:00\\n\\n```\\n“Israel has thanked President Trump and his administration for their unyielding support.”An Israeli official confirmed to the Telegraph that the offensive would “expand beyond air strikes” and “continue as long as necessary”.The surprise attack killed several top Hamas officials, including Issam al-Da’alis, the long-serving prime minister.Israeli media reported that the strikes were planned to take advantage of changed nighttime movement patterns during Ramadan.Medical facilities overwhelmedThey left more than 400 people dead and nearly 600 injured, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.The Red Cross said Gaza’s medical facilities were “overwhelmed”.The White House gave the operation its full backing and blamed Hamas for not releasing hostages.But hostage families expressed their horror at the resumed fighting, accusing the Israeli Government of “abandoning” their loved ones in favour of waging war.On Tuesday, the Israeli military threatened to intensify strikes, including widening the operation beyond an aerial campaign, unless Hamas returned to “genuine” negotiations.It came as the IDF ordered civilians in Gaza to evacuate certain zones on the outskirts of Gaza City and Khan Younis, suggesting a ground campaign could be imminent.Hostages still heldTanks and other military vehicles were photographed at the border fence.Announcing the military operation, the Prime Minister’s office said the action had been taken “following Hamas’ repeated refusal to release our hostages, as well as its rejection of all the proposals it has received from US presidential envoy Steve Witkoff from the mediators”.Gideon Sa’ar, the Foreign Minister, said the strikes were necessary to break the impasse.“In the past two and a half weeks, we have reached a deadlock – there is neither air strikes nor the return of hostages, and this is something Israel cannot accept,” he said.An unnamed military source later said the aim of the operation was to push Hamas into accepting the Witkoff proposal, including an extended ceasefire and a greater influx of aid in return for the release of living hostages.Thirty-three living hostages were released under the 42-day first phase of the deal, which ran from January 15.In outline, phase two obliged Israel to withdraw all its troops from Gaza as a prelude to ending the war.Netanyahu aims to defeat HamasBut Netanyahu repeatedly stalled negotiations on these points because he said it failed to meet his war aim of defeating Hamas once and for all.Witkoff tried to negotiate an alternative deal that roughly resembled a repeat of phase one, but Hamas refused because it did not address the group’s future in the strip.The terror group issued a statement on Tuesday saying: “Netanyahu and his extremist government have decided to overturn the ceasefire agreement, exposing the prisoners in Gaza to an unknown fate.”Emily Damari, a British-Israeli hostage who was released in January, said she was “crushed and disappointed” by the resumption of fighting.The Hostage and Missing Families Forum said: “The greatest fear of the families, of the hostages and of Israeli citizens has been realised.“We are horrified, furious and scared by the intentional shattering of the process of returning our loved ones from the terrible Hamas captivity.“The return to fighting before the return of the last hostage will cost us the 59 hostages who are still in Gaza and who can still be saved and returned.”Netanyahu responded by saying: “All of our hearts are with the hostages and their families.“They are going through an inhuman nightmare every day and every minute.”Twenty-four of the remaining hostages are believed to be living.Hundreds deadAs of mid-afternoon on Tuesday, 404 dead and 562 injured had been taken to hospitals, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, with efforts under way to rescue people trapped in the rubble.Pictures emerged of an apparent blaze at a tented encampment near Khan Younis as a result of the strikes, while others showed what appeared to be distraught civilians identifying loved ones.Dr Mohammad Qishta, an MSF emergency doctor at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, told the Telegraph‘s Battlelines podcast that the scene at the hospital was “disastrous”.“We have received many bodies and parts of bodies,” he said. “Most of them children and women.”Claire Nicolet, the head of emergencies for MSF, said from Gaza: “The population here is completely afraid.“Of course, they saw that this is a full restart of the fighting and they are very scared of what’s next. Unfortunately, we also understood that the medical evacuation has stopped for now which means that normally every day there are a few patients that are going outside by Rafah.“This will not happen today and we don’t know how it will continue.”Leaders killedThe other prominent Hamas leaders killed in Gaza overnight were named as Bahjat Abu Sultan, Ahmad Omar al-Taha, Mahmoud Abu Wafteh and Abu Obaida al-Jimasi.Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority were among Arab governments opposing the action.Qatar’s foreign ministry said Israel’s “escalating policies will ultimately ignite the region and undermine its security and stability”. The Gulf state and Egypt said they were urgently trying to establish talks to halt the escalation.Netanyahu is facing a huge controversy over his attempt to sack Ronen Bar, the head of Israel’s internal security service, just as the organisation is conducting an inquiry into alleged Qatari spies in Netanyahu’s private office and what role that might have played in policymaking before October 7.A large protest was planned in Jerusalem on Wednesday against the dismissal.Politics deniedThe Prime Minister criticised the press for “lies” and denied that any political considerations were behind the military operation in Gaza. He also praised the US for acting against Iran.The resumption of the war has pleased Netanyahu’s far-Right coalition partners, upon whom he relies to stay in Government.Bezalel Smotrich, the Finance Minister, welcomed the strikes, promising that the renewed fighting will “look completely different from what has been done so far”.Conversely, Itamar Ben-Gvir, who withdrew his Otzma Yehudit party from the coalition to protest against the hostage deal, announced his intention to rejoin the Government on Tuesday.Yair Golan, a former IDF Major General and now leader of the Left-leaning The Democrats, said: “The soldiers on the front lines and the hostages in Gaza are just cards in Netanyahu’s game of survival.“The protests must erupt in fury,” he said.At a rally in Tel Aviv’s Hostages Square on Tuesday, Keith Siegel, a former Hamas captive, told the crowd: “When the previous ceasefire collapsed, one of the terrorists pointed a gun at me and started beating me. He was very angry and took all his anger out on me.”\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

It marks at least the second health-related pick from Trump to be pulled from Senate consideration. Nesheiwat had been scheduled to appear before the Senate health, education, labor and pensions committee on Thursday for her confirmation hearing.Means and her brother, former lobbyist Calley Means, served as key advisers to Kennedy’s longshot 2024 presidential bid and helped broker his endorsement of Trump last summer. The pair made appearances with some of Trump’s biggest supporters, winning praise from conservative pundit Tucker Carlson and podcaster Joe Rogan. Calley Means is currently a White House adviser who appears frequently on television to promote restrictions on Snap benefits, removing fluoride from drinking water and other Maha agenda items.Casey Means has no government experience and dropped out of her surgical residency program, saying she became disillusioned with traditional medicine. She founded a health tech company, Levels, that helps users track blood sugar and other metrics. She also makes money from dietary supplements, creams, teas and other products sponsored on her social media accounts.In interviews and articles, Means and her brother describe a dizzying web of influences to blame for the nation’s health problems, including corrupt food conglomerates that have hooked Americans on unhealthy diets, leaving them reliant on daily medications from the pharmaceutical industry to manage obesity, diabetes and other chronic conditions.Few health experts would dispute that the US diet – full of processed foods – is a contributor to obesity and related problems. But Means goes further, linking changes in diet and lifestyle to a raft of conditions including infertility, Alzheimer’s, depression and erectile dysfunction.“Almost every chronic health symptom that Western medicine addresses is the result of our cells being beleaguered by how we’ve come to live,” Means said in a 2024 book co-written with her brother.Food experts say it’s overly simplistic to declare that all processed foods are harmful, since the designation covers an estimated 60% of US foods, including products as diverse as granola, peanut butter and potato chips.“They are not all created equal,” said Gabby Headrick, a nutrition researcher at George Washington University’s school of public health. “It is much more complicated than just pointing the finger at ultra-processed foods as the driver of chronic disease in the United States.”Means has mostly steered clear of Kennedy’s debunked views on vaccines. But on her website, she has called for more investigation into their safety and recommends making it easier for patients to sue drugmakers in the event of vaccine injuries. Since the late 1980s, federal law has shielded those companies from legal liability to encourage development of vaccines without the threat of costly personal injury lawsuits.She trained as a surgeon at Stanford University but has built an online following by criticizing the medical establishment and promoting natural foods and lifestyle changes to reverse obesity, diabetes and other chronic diseases.If confirmed as surgeon general, Means would be tasked with helping promote Kennedy’s sprawling Maha agenda, which calls for removing thousands of additives and chemicals from US foods, rooting out conflicts of interest at federal agencies and incentivizing healthier foods in school lunches and other nutrition programs.Nesheiwat, Trump’s first pick, is a medical director for an urgent care company in New York and has appeared regularly on Fox News to offer medical expertise and insights. She is a vocal supporter of Trump and shares photos of them together on social media. Nesheiwat is also the sister-in-law of former national security adviser Mike Waltz, who has been nominated to be Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations.Nesheiwat also recently came under criticism from Laura Loomer, a far-right ally of Trump who was instrumental in ousting several members of Trump’s national security council. Loomer posted on Twitter/X earlier this week that “we can’t have a pro-COVID vaccine nepo appointee who is currently embroiled in a medical malpractice case and who didn’t go to medical school in the US” as the surgeon general.Independent freelance journalist Anthony Clark reported last month that Nesheiwat earned her medical degree from the American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine in St Maarten, despite saying that she has a degree from the University of Arkansas School of Medicine.The surgeon general, considered the nation’s doctor, oversees 6,000 US Public Health Service Corps members and can issue advisories that warn of public health threats.In March, the White House pulled from consideration the nomination of former Florida Republican Dave Weldon to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. His skepticism on vaccines had raised concerns from key Republican senators, and he withdrew after being told by the White House that he did not have enough support to be confirmed.The withdrawal was first reported by Bloomberg News.\\n```\\n\\n## [States sue the Trump administration for blocking funds for electric vehicle charging](https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/states-sue-trump-blocking-billions-dollars-electric-vehicle-121574446) (#48376)\\n\\n> 2025-05-08 03:18:21+00:00\\n\\n```\\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Seventeen states are suing President Donald Trump \\'s administration for withholding billions of dollars for building more electric vehicle chargers, according to a federal lawsuit announced Wednesday.The Trump administration in February directed states to stop spending money for electric vehicle charging infrastructure that was allocated under President Joe Biden — part of a broader push by the Republican president to roll back environmental policies advanced by his Democratic predecessor. The EV charger program was set to allocate $5 billion over five years to various states, of which an estimated $3.3 billion had already been made available.The lawsuit is led by attorneys general from California, Colorado and Washington, and challenges the Federal Highway Administration\\'s authority to halt the funding. They argue Congress, which approved the money in 2021 as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, holds that authority.\"These funds were going to be used to shape the future of transportation,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said, calling it “short-sighted” of Trump to revoke the funds.“We won’t sit back while the Trump administration violates the law,” Bonta, a Democrat, said. The U.S. Department of Transportation did not respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.EVs stood at about 8% of new car sales in the U.S. last year, according to Motorintelligence.com, a sign the market is growing — although the pace has slowed as the auto industry tries to convince mainstream buyers about going electric. The program was meant to assuage some concerns and build infrastructure along highway corridors first, then address gaps elsewhere once the state highway obligations were met.Some states with projects running under the program have already been reimbursed by the Biden-era federal funds. Others are still contracting for their sites. Still more had halted their plans by the time the Trump administration ordered states to stop their spending. Regardless, getting these chargers installed and operating has been a slow process with contracting challenges, permitting delays and complex electrical upgrades.It was expected that states would fight against the federal government’s efforts to slow the nation’s electric vehicle charger buildout. New York, for example, which is part of the suit, has been awarded over $175 million in federal funds from the program, and state officials say $120 million is currently being withheld by the Trump administration.Even the electric carmaker Tesla, run by Elon Musk, who has spearheaded Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency efforts to cut federal spending, benefited greatly from funding under the program, receiving millions of dollars to expand its already-massive footprint of chargers in the U.S. Despite threats to the program, experts have said they expect the nation’s EV charging buildout to continue as automakers look to make good on massive electrification ambitions. Consumers thinking about buying an EV often cite concerns about the availability of charging infrastructure. It\\'s a hurdle for people living in multifamily dwellings and in rural areas, or what are otherwise known as “charging deserts.” It\\'s also a problem for people who can\\'t find a place to charge their vehicle near their work, or who often drive longer highway routes.Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said withholding the funds was illegal and would kill thousands of U.S. jobs, ceding them to China.\"Instead of hawking Teslas on the White House lawn, President Trump could actually help Elon — and the nation — by following the law and releasing this bipartisan funding,” Newsom said, referencing Trump\\'s recent purchase of a Tesla in a show of support for Musk.The Trump administration’s effort to withdraw funding for electric vehicle chargers is part of a broader push to roll back environmental policies advanced under Biden. During Trump’s first week back in office, he signed executive orders to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement again, reverse a 2030 target for electric vehicles to make up half of new cars sold, and end environmental justice efforts. At the same time, federal agencies under Trump have rolled back key rules and regulations and supported the build-out of the fossil fuel industry.The U.S. House also advanced proposals last week aimed at blocking California from enforcing vehicle-emission rules, including a ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. The Senate parliamentarian says the California policies are not subject to the review mechanism used by the House.___St. John reported from Detroit.___Austin is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Daily Caller in March she did not have an update on when the nominations or vetting would begin, but said she would provide a list of names to the outlet.Nearly two months later, Trump began those appointments, naming a handful of Missourians to district courts as well as one individual to sit on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Joshua M. Divine of Missouri was appointed Tuesday by Trump to serve as judge on both the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri and Western District of Missouri. Divine is the solicitor general of Missouri and director of special litigation in the Missouri Attorney General’s Office. He was previously chief counsel to Republican Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley and deputy solicitor general in the Missouri Attorney General’s (AG) Office. Divine was also a law clerk to both Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and Judge William H. Pryor of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. He attended Yale Law School, where he was a member of the Yale Law Journal and the Yale Law & Policy Review, according a White House press release. 🚨 Daily Caller White House Correspondent @reaganreese_ asks Press Secretary about timeline of Trump’s judicial appointments, WATCH: pic.twitter.com/lFDL78HRd4 — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) March 17, 2025 During his time with the Missouri Attorney General’s office, Divine represented the state against a lawsuit attempting to overturn Missouri’s restrictions on puberty blockers and hormone treatment for minors. Wright County Circuit Court Judge Craig Carter ultimately sided with Divine and the state. Divine also argued in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri in favor of a block of President Joe Biden’s proposed income-driven repayment plan for borrowers. The court later granted the state its motion to block the student loan forgiveness plan.

A federal judge later granted the judgement after finding the CCP liable for damages concerning the hoarding of personal protective equipment during the 2020 pandemic. Whitney Hermandorfer, Trump’s pick for the Appeals Court for the Sixth Circuit, is the director of the Strategic Litigation Unit in the Office of the Tennessee Attorney General. Hermandorfer was previously a law clerk to Supreme Court Justices Samuel A. Alito and Amy Coney Barrett, as well as Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.

During Biden’s term, his administration challenged the state of Tennessee’s law banning child sex-change procedures.\\xa0 Hermandorfer has also argued against broadening sex discrimination laws to protect individuals from being discriminated based on their gender identity, which often extends to bathroom and locker room use. Additionally, she challenged a government rule that required states to help employees who elected to obtain an abortion.

In one case Bluestone was a prosecutor for, a judge sentenced a former St. Louis middle school principal to two consecutive life terms in prison after he was found guilty of hiring a friend to kill his pregnant schoolteacher girlfriend. Edward Aloysius O’Connell was nominated Tuesday by Trump to serve as associate judge on the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. He was previously chief of staff and deputy general counsel of the Office of the Inspector General of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. O’Connell was also a prosecutor in the Office of the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia for nearly two decades where he prosecuted homicides, felony major crimes, domestic violence, organized crime, and narcotics offenses, according to the White House press release. O’Connell clerked for Judge Rufus King III of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia after he graduated from Quinnipiac University School of Law.

The Supreme Court ultimately dismissed the case in June 2024, ruling that the doctors lacked standing to sue.\\nThe ruling left open the opportunity to states to sue, and Missouri, Idaho, and Kansas ultimately jumped onto pro-life doctors’ already-dismissed lawsuit to continue waging war against the pill.\\nThe lawsuit specifically goes after FDA’s 2016 action extending\\xa0the permissible gestational age of the baby for which a girl or woman may take abortion drugs from seven weeks gestation to ten weeks gestation, as well as the 2021 rule change allowing abortionists to send mifepristone through the mail, among other changes.\\nREAD MORE:\\xa0Exclusive — Shocking Data Suggests Abortion Pill Complications 22 Times Higher Than Previously Reported: ‘FDA Must Reinstate Stronger Safeguards’\\nIn a medication abortion, mifepristone — also called by the brand name Mifeprex\\xa0created by\\xa0Danco Laboratories —\\xa0blocks\\xa0the action of progesterone, which the mother’s body produces to nourish the pregnancy.

\"reciprocal\" tariff rates for many trading partners.However, those reciprocal tariffs were later suspended for 90 days.Britain was not among the countries hit with the higher reciprocal tariffs because it imports more from the US than it exports there.However, the UK was still impacted by a 25% tariff on all cars and all steel and aluminium imports to the US.A UK official said on Tuesday

Powell?](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/21/explainer-trump-powell-federal-reserve-chair) (#47764)\\n\\n> 2025-05-07 15:26:37+00:00\\n\\n```\\nThe US Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, has for months faced attacks from Donald Trump, who has threatened to fire the head of the central bank.While Trump has since walked back his attacks against Powell, insisting he has “no intention” of terminating him after markets slumped, relations between the pair remain strained.Any move by the White House to formally dismiss the Fed chair would be unprecedented. The president has historically respected the independence of the central bank, and kept out of its way – even if there was disagreement over policy.But, of course, it looks like Trump is following his own playbook.“Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Trump said on social media in April.The Fed chair first took office in 2018 after an appointment from Trump, and was later reappointed by Joe Biden in 2022. Though his term is expected to end in May 2026, multiple reports suggested that Trump was considering firing the chair before his term is up.Here’s what we know is going on between Trump and the Federal Reserve.What does the Federal Reserve do?As the central bank, the Fed manages the money supply in the US, primarily by setting the interest rate. When setting it, the Fed considers the inflation rate and the labor market, what it calls its “dual mandate”: higher interest rates could bring down inflation, but negatively affect the labor market, while lower interest rates could do the opposite.Over the last few years, starting before Trump’s second term, the central bank has been trying to bring down inflation, which peaked at 9% in June 2022.To do that, the Fed raised interest rates to a multi-decade high of between 5.25% and 5.5%. Just a few years before, at the height of the pandemic, in 2020 and 2021, interest rates had been close to zero. This made it cheaper to borrow money, including taking out mortgages.Late last year, the Fed lowered interest rates, which are now 4.25% to 4.5% – a whole point lower than where they were a year ago.US stock markets are very sensitive to Fed decisions. Stocks started to climb after September, when the Fed started cutting rates.Why is Trump attacking the Federal Reserve?Since Trump took office again, Fed officials held three meetings, in January, March and May, at which they could have changed interest rates. At all three, they declined to touch the rates, citing economic uncertainty.“Uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further,” the Fed said on Wednesday, as it held rates again. In a statement, it added that its committee of policymakers “judges that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen”.After Trump introduced his newest slate of tariffs, he said on social media that he expected Powell to cut interest rates. “This would be a PERFECT time” for rate cuts, Trump wrote on social media. “CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS.”From Trump’s perspective, cutting rates could offset the impact that his tariffs are having on the US stock market. But for Fed officials, it would risk exacerbating inflation.Powell – who is extremely careful with his public remarks – made some statements that made clear the Fed believes Trump’s tariffs will make prices go up, making it far less likely that the central bank would decrease rates.“Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well-anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem,” he said in Chicago recently.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionThis seemed to set Trump off. “If I want him out, he’ll be out of there real fast, believe me,” the president told reporters in the Oval Office. “I’m not happy with him.”Can Trump legally fire the Fed chair?The clearest answer: right now, probably not, but things could change.Powell has affirmed that the Fed’s independence “is a matter of law”.“We’re not removable except for cause,” Powell said. “Fed independence has pretty broad support across both political parties and on both sides of the hill.”But he also mentioned a case going through the supreme court that may alter the power the president has over federal agencies, stemming from Trump firing an official with the National Labor Relations Board. It is unclear how the court will rule, but it allowed the firings to stand, overruling a lower court.“I don’t think that that decision will apply to the Fed, but I don’t know,” Powell said. “It’s a situation that we’re monitoring carefully.”The Fed’s next board meeting is on 17 and 18 June. Trump is likely to continue pressuring the Fed ahead of this meeting, but officials are not expected to budge.What is the Fed’s case for independence from the White House?The Fed, which holds huge power over the economy, has to be extremely careful about each decision it makes.Moves made by the central bank can affect the stock market, the value of the US dollar and government bonds – which all, in turn, affect the US economy.On the Fed’s independence, Powell said that officials “will only make our decisions based on our best thinking, based on our best analysis of the data and what is the way to achieve our dual mandate goals as we can to best serve the American people”.“We will do what we do strictly without consideration of political or any other extraneous factors,” he said.\\n```\\n\\n## [Trump to announce trade deal with UK on Thursday, reports say](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/5/8/trump-to-announce-trade-deal-with-uk-reports-say?traffic_source=rss) (#47976)\\n\\n> 2025-05-08 05:27:19+00:00\\n\\n```\\nReports come after US president teased the announcement of agreement with an unnamed country.United States President Donald Trump is set to announce a trade deal with the United Kingdom on Thursday, US media have reported, in what would be the first such agreement since he rolled out his sweeping tariffs.\\nThe reports come after Trump on Wednesday teased the announcement of a deal with an unnamed country on social media.\\n“Big News Conference tomorrow morning at 10:00 A.M., The Oval Office, concerning a MAJOR TRADE DEAL WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF A BIG, AND HIGHLY RESPECTED, COUNTRY,” Trump said in a post on his\\xa0Truth Social platform. “THE FIRST OF MANY!!!”\\nThe New York Times, which reported the news along with The Wall Street Journal, Politico and CNN, said that it was not clear whether the agreement had been finalised.\\nInvestors have been anxiously waiting for signs of an easing of Trump’s trade war amid fears that prolonged uncertainty over tariffs could inflict serious damage to the global economy.\\nThe International Monetary Fund last month lowered its global growth forecast for 2025 from 3.3 percent to 2.8 percent amid Trump’s trade salvoes.\\nOn Tuesday, US and Chinese officials confirmed that they would hold their first round of trade talks in Switzerland this weekend, raising hopes of a breakthrough in the de facto mutual trade embargo between the world’s two largest economies.\\nThe UK was spared from Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs announced against dozens of countries last month, but its exports have been subject to a 10 percent “baseline” duty since April 9.\\nThe US and UK did 314.6 billion pounds ($419bn) worth of trade in goods and services in 2024, an increase of 3.9 percent from the previous year, according to the UK’s Department for Business and Trade.\\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer earlier this week announced the finalisation of a “landmark” trade deal with India that he said would add 4.8 billion pounds ($6.4bn) a year to the economy.\\n```\\n\\n## [Trump hails US-UK trade agreement but scope of deal is unclear](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250508-trump-to-announce-trade-deal-with-uk-on-thursday-us-media) (#47998)\\n\\n> 2025-05-08 04:15:16+00:00\\n\\n```\\nUS President Donald Trump announced Thursday an agreement with Britain on trade, which would be the first such deal since he launched his global tariffs blitz.Trump provided no details about the scope of the agreement, which comes a month after he imposed sweeping tariffs on US trading partners on his April 2 \"Liberation Day\".\"The agreement with the United Kingdom is a full and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come,\" the president posted on his Truth Social platform.\"Because of our long time history and allegiance together, it is a great honor to have the United Kingdom as our FIRST announcement.

Pronounced “gooey-duck,” the world’s largest burrowing clam has been harvested in tidelands by George’s Indigenous ancestors in the Pacific Northwest since before Europeans arrived. In recent years it has also become a delicacy in China, with Washington state sending 90% of its geoducks there, creating a niche yet lucrative American seafood export. But the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China is now crippling an entire industry that hand-harvests geoducks, leaving Washington state divers without work, Seattle exporters without business and Chinese aficionados with fewer of these prized clams.“It’s the first time in 24 years where I don’t know when or if we’ll be going back to work or if I have to find another job or what we’re going to do,” George said.U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff-driven economic feud with China, which dates back to his first term in office, swiftly resumed in February within weeks of taking back the White House. By April, Trump had placed tariffs of at least 145% on China, which led China to retaliate with tariffs of 125% on the U.S.Top U.S. officials are set to meet with a high-level Chinese delegation this weekend in Switzerland in the first major talks between the two nations since the latest tariffs were imposed, but it is unclear where those talks will lead.Enter the geoduck, weighing about 2 pounds and so entrenched in local culture that it is the mascot for Evergreen State College in Olympia. The meaty mollusk is best described as sweet and briny, and it\\'s often sliced raw for crisp sashimi out west while China consumers prefer it chewy in stir-fries or hot pot soups. Pre-tariff costs were as high as $100 per pound in restaurants, so it’s a dish generally reserved for special occasions like Chinese New Year, or to celebrate a business gathering.Unlike other products with long-lasting shelf life and standing inventory, the trade war has had an immediate, direct effect on the delicate geoducks, which are shipped alive the same day of harvest.“The whole market, everybody just had to stop,” said Jim Boure, general manager of Suquamish Seafoods, an enterprise of the Suquamish Tribe. “We started getting phone calls from buyers saying orders are canceled.”The millions of pounds of geoducks shipped annually to China come from two main sources: wild harvests on tracts of seafloor that are split between the Washington State Department of Natural Resources and Puget Sound Treaty Indian Tribes, and tideland farms. The state’s share is auctioned to private exporters that often hire contract divers to harvest them. As of late April, Washington state divers had only pulled about half of the expected harvest from the state tracts, said Blain Reeves, an aquatic resources division manager for the state’s Department of Natural Resources. Last year, the state and tribes collectively harvested about 3.4 million pounds of wild Washington geoduck for sale. The state generated $22.4 million in revenue for their half of the clams, which went toward paying for aquatic restoration projects locally. The state doesn\\'t track how much is harvested by private farmers. “If only half the pounds that were contracted are harvested, then our revenue is halved,” Reeves said.The Suquamish operation has no orders to harvest for at the moment, but it still must keep up with the maintenance to stay ready for business if and when China comes calling. On a recent April day, George’s team made a quick trip to collect a handful of the clams for state lab testing.“When we’re doing the job, and it’s not all this other political stuff behind the scenes and everything else, we love this,” said George, adding that diving, which takes place early in the day so that the geoducks are on an airplane by evening, has allowed him to watch his kids grow up.Fellow diver Kyle Purser said he cherishes his underwater job, but now fears it\\'s being taken away. \"When you’re watching your money disappear and you’ve got families to feed and not knowing when you\\'re going to get your next paycheck, (it\\'s) very stressful,” he said. The geoduck import market was already facing weaker demand in recent years due to the Chinese economy’s struggle to regain post-pandemic momentum. While the tariffs have only exacerbated troubles for geoduck sellers in Washington, there\\'s also been an unintended consequence: The American trade war has inadvertently boosted the Canadian geoduck business, which is facing a mere 25% tariff from China in comparison to the 125% for the U.S.Washington state in the U.S. and Canada\\'s British Columbia province are the two primary places where the wild geoducks grow naturally for commercial harvest. The two countries did healthy business primarily serving Chinese appetites for decades, in part because quantities are limited. It’s a labor-intensive and heavily-regulated harvest, as divers must go several feet below the surface to dig for them.“They love the fact that it tastes like the sea,” said James Austin, president of Canada’s Underwater Harvesters Association. “It’s a product that’s really a hit with the Chinese. It’s all about the wild coastline. It’s really prestigious.”Austin said he expects there will be 2.75 million pounds of Canadian geoducks harvested in 2025, worth approximately $60 million Canadian dollars ($43.4 million USD) in revenue. While demand has been relatively low but still steady for Canadian\\'s geoducks, Austin said they\\'re now the leading exporters for China, which has helped them negotiate higher prices as a result. For example, after Canada got hit with a 25% tariff in March, export sale prices dropped to $12 per pound, and after the U.S. got hit with a 125% tariff in April, Canadian geoducks are now being sold for $17 a pound.“We have no competitors right now,” Austin said.Yang Bin at Beihai Huaxiashougang Health Industry Company in Beihai city of Guangxi province in China said their seafood wholesale important business no longer gets geoduck from the U.S.“We don’t care about U.S. tariffs because we can get geoduck from other countries with stable prices,” Yang said.On their first week back to work since the tariff fight brought business to a standstill in Washington state, Derrick McRae and his brother pulled up about 800 pounds of wild geoducks in just one April day. He donned a full-body diving outfit with an oxygen line tethered to his boat to dive under the cold waters of an inland sea channel west of Seattle. Kneeled on the seafloor, McRae used a water spray gun to move the sand covering the geoducks. In the cloud of sediment, he felt for the neck with his hand, pulling the clam and stuffing it in a net attached to him. “We’re just kind of waiting on the edge of our seats to see what happens next,” McRae said. At one of the southernmost inlets, farmer Ian Child said the tariff disruption is not just hurting his bottom line but the entire farming process. He usually places young geoducks in the sand in the summer, but he can’t mix new crops with any existing unharvested clams.“I think that the demand is still over there for the product,” he said of China. “I think they still want it. It’s just a matter of where the tariffs will land.” ___Associated Press researcher Yu Bing contributed from Beijing.\\n```\\n\\n## [Carney and Trump come face-to-face as bilateral tensions mount](https://theweek.com/politics/carney-trump-canada-united-states-meeting) (#50430)\\n\\n> 2025-05-07 18:59:14+00:00\\n\\n```\\nPerhaps the most telling moment of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney\\'s first meeting with President Donald Trump came after the two world leaders had concluded their awkward, occasionally tense sit-down: \"I\\'m glad that you couldn\\'t tell what was going through my mind,\" Carney said, after being asked by Toronto Star reporter Tonda MacCharles what he was thinking while listening to Trump extol the virtues of annexing Canada. \"Oh, I could,\" MacCharles laughed.Reporter: I was watching your face during the meeting.. what was going through your mind when the President talked about erasing the border..Carney: I’m glad that you couldn’t tell what was going through my mind Reporter: Oh I could pic.twitter.com/ulnpYr98uAMay 6, 2025\\nSubscribe to The Week\\nThe Week provides readers with a wide range of perspectives from 200 trusted news sources.\\nTry 6 Free Issues\\nSign up for The Week\\'s Free Newsletters\\nFrom our daily WeekDay news briefing to an award-winning Food & Drink email, get the best of The Week delivered directly to your inbox.\\nFrom our daily WeekDay news briefing to an award-winning Food & Drink email, get the best of The Week delivered directly to your inbox.\\n```\\n\\n## [U.S. and China set for high-stakes talks amid trade war](https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/u-s-and-china-set-for-high-stakes-talks-amid-trade-war-239127109567) (#52568)\\n\\n> 2025-05-08 00:24:48+00:00\\n\\n```\\nMay 8, 202501:51Now Playing01:51UP NEXTAn urgent manhunt is underway for a Texas man accused of murder01:28The California Academy of Sciences hopes to restart blue butterfly population01:31Growing fears India and Pakistan are on the brink of war01:37New protests break out at Columbia University00:55Three ex-Memphis police officers found not guilty in death of Tyre Nichols01:49FAA announces changes to alleviate Newark Airport problems01:58Black smoke signals no new pope chosen on first day of conclave02:29Man arrested after security incident at Jennifer Aniston’s home01:34Fears of war as India and Pakistan exchange strikes00:50Firefighters make daring rescue in Kentucky01:29Massive lines as travelers prepare for Real ID deadline01:23Secretive conclave to elect next pope set to begin on Wednesday01:57Lawsuit seeking $50 million accuses Smokey Robinson of rape02:15President Trump meets Canada’s new leader amid trade war02:37Source: Newark ATC communications blackout happened twice before02:24Israel plans major shift in strategy to seize and hold territory in war against Hamas01:32Search underway after suspected smuggling boat capsizes near San Diego01:30Pope Francis gave his remaining money to fund pasta factory at juvenile detention center01:26Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs tells judge he’s ‘nervous’ on first day of jury selection01:04Nightly NewsNow PlayingU.S. and China set for high-stakes talks amid trade war01:51UP NEXTAn urgent manhunt is underway for a Texas man accused of murder01:28The California Academy of Sciences hopes to restart blue butterfly population01:31Growing fears India and Pakistan are on the brink of war01:37New protests break out at Columbia University00:55Three ex-Memphis police officers found not guilty in death of Tyre Nichols01:49\\n```\\n\\n## [Fed warns of economic uncertainty from Trump tariffs ahead of U.S.-China talks](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/fed-warns-of-economic-uncertainty-from-trump-tariffs-ahead-of-u-s-china-talks-239108165563) (#52572)\\n\\n> 2025-05-07 20:18:17+00:00\\n\\n```\\nMay 7, 202510:15GOP-proposed tax cuts are ‘morally wrong’ and ‘fiscally stupid,’ House Democrat says06:54Nuclear rivals India and Pakistan are \\'on the brink\\' of war, warns analyst05:47Now Playing10:15UP NEXT‘Number one check’ Democrats can have on Trump is taking back the House, says Democratic lawmaker07:49Trump meeting with Canadian PM a ‘new opportunity’ to rebuild relationship, says Ontario premier04:48Rep.

According to a report from the Washington Post, Musk’s satellite internet company Starlink has attracted new interest from nations that are looking to wiggle their way out of Trump’s tariff crunch. The Post highlights the small nation of Lesotho, which was inexplicably subjected to a 50% tax when Trump first announced his so-called “reciprocal” penalties (which turned out to be the result of some sort of very strange, nonsensical formula that may or may not have come from a chatbot). Two weeks after the tariffs were announced, Lesotho leadership met with representatives of Starlink, which had been trying to get a foothold in the country for some time prior, and signed a deal to make the company Lesotho’s first-ever satellite internet service. Coincidences happen, of course. It’s just that, according to the Post, they’re happening pretty regularly right now with Starlink. Around the same time as the tariffs were being discussed and implemented, Starlink also struck deals to provide service in parts of Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of Congo, India, Pakistan, Somalia, and Vietnam.\\nIn the case of Lesotho, a memo obtained by the Post makes it clear that there’s an attempt to curry favor happening: “As the government of Lesotho negotiates a trade deal with the United States, it hopes that licensing Starlink demonstrates goodwill and intent to welcome U.S. businesses,” the internal State Department communication read. It’s hard to imagine that other nations haven’t had similar thoughts of strategically aligning themselves with a company run by a Trump White House employee in order to get some relief. The Trump administration has not been explicitly pushing Starlink on these companies, according to the report, but it has been encouraging countries to do business with US-based satellite internet firms, and there happens to be one very big, prominent one that comes to mind. And it certainly seems like countries are treating Starlink favorably. India, for example, reportedly sped up the approvals process for the company in an effort to grease the wheels for trade deals, per the Post.\\nLining Musk’s pockets may not be the primary purpose of the Trump admin pushing satellite internet on countries (though it surely doesn’t hurt, either). Chinese companies are quickly ramping up to offer an alternative to Starlink, and the US would prefer to capture those markets before its competitors can. So it’s using the leverage to push American products. It is funny how it seems to always benefit Trump’s backers, though, right? Coincidences happen all the time.\\n```\\n\\n## [Mark Carney says Canada \\'not for sale\\' after meeting Trump](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-05-07/pm-mark-carney-says-canada-not-for-sale-after/105265116) (#53627)\\n\\n> 2025-05-07 05:34:04+00:00\\n\\n```\\nThis service may include material from Agence France-Presse (AFP), APTN, Reuters, AAP, CNN and the BBC World Service which is copyright and cannot be reproduced.AEST = Australian Eastern Standard Time which is 10 hours ahead of GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)\\n```\\n\\n## [Trump announces trade deal with the U.K., first since his tariffs sent markets reeling](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/07/nx-s1-5389973/trump-trade-deal-uk-tariffs) (#54209)\\n\\n> 2025-05-08 03:06:42+00:00\\n\\n```\\nPresident Trump speaks to reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday.\\nJim Watson/AFP\\nhide caption\\ntoggle caption\\nJim Watson/AFP\\nPresident Trump on Thursday said on social media that his administration had come to an agreement with the United Kingdom on trade issues, his first such deal since his steep tariffs last month roiled stock markets.\\nIt normally takes many months of negotiations to hammer out trade agreements. Details of Trump\\'s arrangement with the U.K. were not immediately available, though Trump said it would be \"full and comprehensive.\" He is expected to formally announce the deal at 10 a.m. ET in the Oval Office. Trump\\'s administration has engaged in a flurry of talks with trading partners since April 2, when Trump rolled out a 10% tariff on all imported goods, as well as what he called \"reciprocal tariffs\" — steep tariff walls aimed at punishing countries for their trading practices and volumes, and at drawing manufacturing to America.\\nThe United Kingdom was not among the countries facing the big hikes. It has had baseline tariffs of 10% on its exports, as well as higher sectoral tariffs on exports of cars, steel and aluminum. Trump retreated from his country-specific tariffs after markets plunged last month, pausing the hikes for 90 days, though he kept the 10% baseline in place, as well as those on autos, steel and aluminum — and extremely steep tariffs on China, where 145% tariffs have effectively stopped shipments. Economists have warned that the tariffs could lead to shortages of some goods and raise consumer prices for others. Trump administration officials have said his moves brought countries to the table to talk about a range of trade issues, including Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Vietnam and India. On Saturday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are set to meet China\\'s He Lifeng in Switzerland.

They’re seeing more this week.\\nForecast risk of excessive rain for Wednesday\\nMay 7, 2025A sluggish line of storms continues to deliver repeated rounds of heavy rainfall across the already saturated ground of the Southeast this week, renewing flash flood risks. In New Orleans, where late last month storms dropped a month’s worth of rain in a day, weary forecasters at the local office of the National Weather Service warned that the area’s “tolerance for another round of heavy rain is fairly low.”Across the region on Wednesday, rainfall totals by late afternoon ranged from between one and three inches in most of Southern Louisiana. Metairie, just outside New Orleans, was an outlier, receiving 4.56 inches, according to the National Weather Service in New Orleans.The Weather Prediction Center placed a broad zone from southeastern Texas to southwestern Alabama under an elevated risk for flash flooding, and a slightly higher risk warning was in effect across southern Louisiana and Mississippi. The day’s highest warning was in place across southeast Louisiana, including New Orleans.“There will still be some showers and thunderstorms throughout the afternoon and into tonight,” Peter Mullinax, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center, said. “But the heaviest action is going on this morning.”A flood watch remained in effect in New Orleans through Thursday, according to the National Weather Service. There were only a few reports of minor flooding on Wednesday afternoon in the city.The repeated downpours are the result of storms breaking out along a nearly stationary front, sitting just north of the Gulf Coast. Warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico is building up along this front, and a weather system approaching from the west is injecting additional energy into the atmosphere. As a result, the storms are dropping large amounts of rain in a short amount of time to the same areas.The slow-moving storms have already been affecting the region since early in the week, delivering significant rainfall and flooding across parts of Texas and Louisiana. On Monday and Tuesday, areas in Louisiana received two to four inches of rain, with some locations in the west surpassing eight inches over the 48-hour period.In Texas, some areas have already exceeded their average monthly rainfall for May in just the first week. In Amarillo, 2.46 inches of rain was recorded by Wednesday morning, far surpassing the city’s May average of 2.27 inches.VideoHeavy rain, storms and flash flooding are expected across Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi this week.CreditCredit...Daniel Cole/Reuters“It’s been quite wet for a good chunk of the start,” Mr. Mullinax said. “Some of this is welcomed, especially as we get closer to summer, but to have it be that kind of levels, of course it’s going to cause some flooding problems, and unfortunately that’s been the case the last couple of days, especially in northern and eastern Texas.”In Brenham, Texas, between Austin and Houston, a search operation recovered the body of Devah Woods, 10, on Tuesday. She had last been seen on Monday as storms moved through the area.“The response from everyone was overwhelming,” Atwood Kenjura, the mayor of Brenham, said during a news conference, expressing gratitude to rescue workers. The Brenham Fire Department reported that the search effort had included drones, swift water rescue teams and canine units.Severe weather was an added threat in the Southeast through Thursday, especially across portions of Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. The Storm Prediction Center warned of hail and damaging winds as the primary threats, along with a low risk of tornadoes. Southeastern Texas, including cities such as Victoria and Missouri City, were under slightly higher risk of severe weather, especially Wednesday afternoon and evening.The Southeast will continue to face severe weather and high rainfall in the coming days. The Weather Prediction Center warned of flash flood risks for parts of Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida and, later this week, South Carolina. Southeast Louisiana into southwest Alabama, including New Orleans and Mobile, remain under a slightly higher risk.“We’ve got rainfall in the forecast all the next seven days,” Mr. Mullinax said. “It’s just a tough stretch of unsettled weather in the Southeast for the next week.”There were sporadic power outages in the region. About 16,000 households in Louisiana, 8,000 in Mississippi, and 6,000 in Texas had no power, as of early Wednesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.Adeel Hassan contributed reporting.Nazaneen Ghaffar is a Times reporter on the Weather team.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\\n```\\n\\n## [Real-world geoengineering experiments revealed by UK agency](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/07/real-world-geoengineering-experiments-revealed-by-uk-agency) (#47822)\\n\\n> 2025-05-07 11:19:05+00:00\\n\\n```\\nReal-world geoengineering experiments spanning the globe from the Arctic to the Great Barrier Reef are being funded by the UK government. They will test sun-reflecting particles in the stratosphere, brightening reflective clouds using sprays of seawater and pumping water on to sea ice to thicken it.Getting this “critical missing scientific data” is vital with the Earth nearing several catastrophic climate tipping points, said the Advanced Research and Invention Agency (Aria), the government agency backing the plan. If demonstrated to be safe, geoengineering could temporarily cool the planet and give more time to tackle the root cause of the climate crisis: the burning of fossil fuels.The experiments will be small-scale and rigorously assessed before going ahead, Aria said. Other projects in the £56.8m programme will model the impacts of geoengineering on the climate and research how it could be governed internationally.Geoengineering is controversial, with some scientists calling it a “dangerous distraction” from cutting emissions and concerned about unintended climate impacts. Some previously planned outdoor experiments have been cancelled after strong opposition.However, given the failure of the world to stop emissions rising to date, and the recent run of record hot years, backers of solar geoengineering say researching the technology is vital in case an emergency brake is needed. The Aria programme, along with another £10m project, makes the UK one of the biggest funders of geoengineering research in the world.“Decarbonisation is the first and best chance of avoiding these tipping points,” said Prof Mark Symes, the programme director at Aria. “But the current trajectory puts us in danger of triggering some tipping points, regardless of what happens with net zero, so we do need to think about what we might do in that eventuality.“The point of the programme is to explore and research as transparently as possible whether any of the proposed cooling approaches could ever be used safely,” he said. “Life in the UK could become very difficult if any of these tipping points were triggered.”Ilan Gur, Aria’s CEO, said: “If science can show us that an elegantly designed spray of seawater can protect and preserve the incredible biodiversity of the Great Barrier Reef, isn’t that something we want to understand?”The announcement was criticised by Prof Raymond Pierrehumbert at the University of Oxford: “Solar geoengineering has enormous and troubling implications for global society. The UK funding sets a dangerous precedent for other governments to jump on the bandwagon [and] it is the height of folly to open the door to field experiments in the absence of any national or international governance.”Mary Church, at the Center for International Environmental Law, said: “Solar geoengineering is inherently unpredictable and risks breaking further an already broken climate system. Conducting small-scale experiments risks normalising highly controversial theories and accelerating technological development, creating a slippery slope toward full-scale deployment.”Most geoengineering proposals aim to block sunlight reaching and heating the Earth’s surface. However, solar radiation management (SRM) has the potential for serious unintended consequences, such as shifting rains vital to food production. Some private companies are already working on geoengineering; that makes building the scientific evidence base even more important, Gur said.solar geoengineering diagramThe Aria-funded experiments include sending a weather balloon into the stratosphere above the US or UK. Milligram samples of non-toxic mineral dust will be exposed to the high-altitude conditions and then recovered to assess how the particles’ properties change with time.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionAnother three experiments will test how seawater sprays or electrical charges delivered by drones can seed tiny water droplets, making clouds over the oceans reflect more sunlight. One will expand current work over the Great Barrier Reef, which is in crisis because of global heating, and may reach 100sq km in scale, while another will take place on the UK coast.One experiment will involve pumping water on to sea ice in Canada in winter. The water will freeze and preserve the ice sheet for longer in summer. Photograph: Paul Eckert/GettyA fifth experiment will involve pumping water on to sea ice in Canada in winter, reaching up to one 1 sq km in scale. The water will freeze and preserve the ice sheet for longer in summer. Bright white ice reflects far more sunlight than the dark ocean revealed when sea ice is lost to warming waters.There will be an environmental impact assessment made public before any outdoor experiments take place and local communities will have been consulted. There is also an independent oversight committee as part of the approval process, Aria said, chaired by the leading climate scientist Prof Piers Forster and including members from India and Ghana.The Aria programme will also assess space reflectors, which are sunshades placed into orbit, using modelling to determine their feasibility. “This is the most speculative of all the approaches we’re funding,” said Symes. Volcanic eruptions naturally inject particles into the atmosphere and another project will fly drones through the plumes to measure the particles’ effects.Seven modelling teams will investigate the impacts of geoengineering on climate and ecosystems, especially in developing countries, where about 85% of the world’s population lives. There will be a further five teams working on ethics and governance to explore the wider societal implications of geoengineering, such as how any future deployment should be agreed and managed.\\n```\\n\\n## [Coming this summer: Record-breaking heat and plenty of hurricanes](https://grist.org/extreme-heat/summer-record-breaking-heat-hurricanes-liheap/) (#48932)\\n\\n> 2025-05-07 08:30:00+00:00\\n\\n```\\nWith less than a month to go until summer, weather forecasters have been dropping some troubling news about what might be in store. AccuWeather had already predicted an especially active season — which begins June 1 — with up to 10 hurricanes out at sea, and its meteorologists are now forecasting a hotter-than-normal summer on land. Last week, the company warned that the three months could bring “sweltering heat, severe weather, intense wildfires, and the start of a dynamic hurricane season” — an echo of last summer, which was the hottest on record. In some places, like coastal cities along the Gulf Coast, those hazards could combine into dangerous “compound disasters,” with heat waves and hurricanes arriving back-to-back.\\nThe Trump administration’s cost-cutting crusade could make this summer’s weather all the more perilous. Mass layoffs at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have hurricane forecasters worried that they’ll lose access to the data they need to make accurate predictions of where storms will make landfall and at what intensity. And as electricity gets more expensive and global warming forces households to run their air-conditioning more, advocates worry that the loss of federal support for people struggling to pay their electric bills could leave a swath of the population especially vulnerable.\\nPresident Donald Trump’s proposed 2026 budget, unveiled last week, would cancel the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which provides $4 billion a year to help people pay electricity bills, said Alison Coffey, senior policy analyst at the Boston-based nonprofit Initiative for Energy Justice. “We are about to experience one of the hottest summers on record,” Coffey said. “And this is happening at a time when U.S. households are really, really struggling to pay their utility bills.”\\nAccuWeather’s summer forecast isn’t the kind you get for your local weather, so they can’t tell you if it will be raining in your town on the Fourth of July. Instead, this seasonal forecast looks at weather trends in March and April, as well as larger phenomena like La Niña and El Niño, the two bands of warm and cold water in the Pacific Ocean that influence the atmosphere above the western U.S. AccuWeather compares all that to how those spring and summer months looked in previous years to get an idea of what might unfold this time around.\\nAccuWeather says that temperatures could run higher than average across the vast majority of the country this summer. Its forecast also warns of warmer nights, especially in the eastern U.S. These make heat waves all the more unbearable as the human body can’t get the respite of a cool night to bring down the physiological stress.\\nThe eastern U.S. could also suffer through heat waves punctuated by thunderstorms that load the atmosphere with humidity. Those conditions make the human body less efficient at sweating, raising the risk of heat-related illnesses and deaths. Heat kills more people in the U.S. than any other natural disaster, in part because it can aggravate existing conditions like heart disease and asthma.\\nOut West, the Dakotas, Montana, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon could see temperatures 3 degrees Fahrenheit (or more) higher than average. “The daytime highs are a bigger issue, [records] that could be challenged or broken in parts of the Northern Rockies and in the Northwest coming up this summer,” said Paul Pastelok, a senior meteorologist at AccuWeather.\\nHigh temperatures are\\xa0going to increase wildfire risk, Pastelok added, because a dry, heat-baked landscape is a flammable landscape. Right now almost 40 percent of the U.S. is under drought conditions, double the area of last year. Some parts of the American West actually had a fairly wet winter, but that can also cause problems because strong-growing plants and trees can turn into fuel in the extra-hot summer heat. And as the season wears on, the landscape gets drier, so it’s more liable to burn catastrophically.\\nDay after day of relentless heat, especially if it’s humid out too, forces people to run the AC more to stay healthy. For the rich, that’s no problem. But lower-income folks suffer a high “energy burden,” meaning a $200 monthly utility bill is a much larger proportion of their income. Americans are also wrestling with an escalating cost-of-living crisis as rent and inflation march higher. With 1 in 6 American households now behind on their utility bills, according to the Initiative for Energy Justice, and 3 million of them having their power shut off each year, the danger is losing power during a heat wave this summer.\\nCity dwellers face added risk here because of the urban heat island effect, the way sidewalks, parking lots, and buildings trap heat and make cities much hotter than surrounding rural areas. Lower-income neighborhoods get 15 to 20 degrees hotter than richer neighborhoods because they have fewer trees, which provide shade and cooling, according to Vivek Shandas, a climate adaptation scientist at Portland State University. “Those neighborhoods and the residents living in them just bear the brunt of that heat wave a lot more acutely than someone living in a more highly invested neighborhood, where tree canopy is lush.”\\nIt will take a whole lot longer to fix the systemic issues that drive heat disparities in cities. But in the meantime, access to air-conditioning will be increasingly crucial as the planet warms. “Having financial assistance for low-income households to make sure that they can keep their electricity and their cooling on during the sweltering summer is more crucial than ever,” Coffey said.\\n```\\n\\n## [Drought conditions already hitting UK crop production, farmers say](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/07/drought-conditions-already-hitting-uk-crop-production-farmers-say) (#51197)\\n\\n> 2025-05-07 16:11:47+00:00\\n\\n```\\nCrops are already failing in England because of drought conditions this spring, farmers have said.People should start to ration their water use, the Environment Agency said, as water companies prepare for a summer of drought. The government has also asked the water CEOs to do more to avert water shortages, and the EA said hosepipe bans are on the horizon if a significant amount of rain does not fall.Members of the National Drought Group, who met on Wednesday to discuss their plans, told the Guardian that there is “no slack” in the system, that water companies are “woefully underprepared” for drought and the plan for many is “simply praying for rain”.It has been the driest start to spring in 69 years. England saw its driest March since 1961 and in April the country received just half its normal rainfall. Farmers have had to start irrigating crops earlier, and reservoir levels are either notably or exceptionally low across thenorth-east and north-west of England.According to the National Farmers’ Union (NFU) some crops are already failing, and significant rainfall in early May will be essential to avoid significant yield penalties and further losses. Livestock yields could also be at risk; grazing is not yet short, but farmers point out that fields will need a decent amount of rain to get animals through the summer.NFU deputy president, David Exwood, said: “The dry conditions and lack of any substantial rainfall has meant farmers in some parts of the country have started to irrigate crops much earlier than normal. The extreme weather patterns we have experienced over the past few years are impacting our ability to feed the nation.”The last time the UK was hit with a bad drought was 2022, when crops failed and London and the south-east almost ran out of water and were weeks from going into emergency measures. There were also hosepipe bans across the country. Experts at the NDG said the conditions this year are similar to those in 2022.Reservoir levels are lower than they were this time in 2022, however. Reservoir storage across England is 84% of total capacity, compared to 90% at the end of April in 2022. The NDG heard that a number of reservoirs in the north are well below what they should be for this time of year, and that northern water companies are upping their activities around fixing leaks ahead of summer. They are already looking at extracting from rivers, months before they would generally need to, and river flows are exceptionally low at present. The NDG heard that there have been mass fish deaths above what would be expected for this time of year.“There’s no resilience in the system,” said a NDG source, adding: “All the Environment Agency and water companies kept saying was, ‘we hope it’s going to rain’.”Stuart Singleton-White, head of campaigns at the Angling Trust, said: “If the summer remains as dry as this spring, the driest spring since the infamous year of 1976, then we’re all going to pay the price for the complacency that has been the hallmark of the way water companies have managed our water. No new reservoirs since privatisation, alarming rates of leakage, and lack of preparation for the impacts of climate change.“With fish kills already at a high level and many rivers at a low level for the time of year, it could turn out to be a challenging summer of drought and devastation for our rivers and fish. A repeat of 2022 is unthinkable.”Richard Thompson, Environment Agency deputy director of water, said: “The last two years were some of the wettest on record for England, but drier conditions at the start of this year mean a drought is a possibility and we need to be prepared.\\n“It’s heartening to see more people looking to reduce their water use and we expect water companies to do more to cut leakage and roll out smart meters.”\\n```\\n\\n## [How much will climate change affect YOU?

This map shows the locations where children born in 2020 are to be most affected by heatwaves, under a scenario where the world warms\\xa03.5°C (6.3°F) by the year 2100 Under a 1.5 °C warming scenario, 132 million children aged 5-18 in 2025 face unprecedented lifetime exposure to river floods - but this increases to\\xa0191 million under a 3.5 °C scenario People affected by \\'unprecedented lifetime exposure\\' to heatwaves by birth year 1960: 13 million\\xa01970: 27 million\\xa01980: 39\\xa0million\\xa01990: 50 million\\xa02000: 51 million\\xa02010: 55 million\\xa02020: 58 million\\xa0(Figures refer to a 1.5°C warming scenario) In all, 855 million children worldwide will face unprecedented exposure to heatwaves even if we manage to limit global warming to\\xa01.5°C (2.7°F), they reveal.\\xa0But if global warming reaches a more serious 3.5°C by 2100, a whopping 1.5 billion children worldwide will be similarly exposed.\\xa0Although heatwaves will be the most prominent threat, the five other extremes will affect many millions of today\\'s children, regardless of warming scenario.\\xa0For example,\\xa0under a 1.5 °C warming scenario, 119 million children aged 5-18 in 2025 will face unprecedented lifetime exposure to wildfires –\\xa0but this increases to 147 million under a 3.5°C scenario.\\xa0Similarly, under a 1.5 °C warming scenario, 132 million children aged 5-18 in 2025 will face unprecedented lifetime exposure to river floods – but this increases to 191 million under a 3.5 °C scenario.Overall, the highest fraction of children facing unprecedented lifetime exposure is for heatwaves (92 per cent of 2020 birth cohort with 3.5°C of warming), followed by crop failures (around 30 per cent) and river floods (around 15 per cent).\\xa0Even if we successfully limit global warming to 1.5°C by 2100, 52 per cent of children born in 2020 will face unprecedented heatwave exposure, compared to only 16 per cent of those born in 1960.\\xa0\\'The numbers vary per climate extreme, but the general pattern is the same,\\' Professor Thiery told MailOnline.\\xa0 Graph shows number of people worldwide facing \\'unprecedented lifetime exposure\\' (ULE) to heatwaves by birth year.

Pakistani officials said at least 20 people were killed in the airstrikes.While Pakistani officials have said that Pakistan reserves the right to retaliate, Khawaja Muhammad Asif, the defense minister, struck a different tone, suggesting that Pakistan had already responded by shooting down Indian planes and drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles or U.A.V.s.He said his country would refrain from further action if India took no additional steps to attack and agreed to an independent investigation.Mr. Asif said Pakistan’s Air Force had shot down five Indian planes and two drones. In addition, Pakistani jamming devices and electronic warfare equipment stopped some Indian missile launches and forced other planes to make emergency landings, he said.Image“Restraint is still being applied,” said Khawaja Muhammad Asif, Pakistan’s defense minister. “But if the same situation arises tonight, the situation could flare up very easily.”Credit...Waseem Khan/ReutersIndian officials and Western diplomats, as well as witnesses and local media, have said that two or three Indian planes went down on the Indian side of the border.“We could have taken down 10 planes yesterday,” Mr. Asif said. “We had the opportunity, but we restricted it to five planes and two U.A.V.s because we didn’t want to expand this situation.”Mr. Trump’s comments on Tuesday that he hopes the conflict “ends very quickly” were helpful, Mr. Asif said. He added that he would welcome further U.S. efforts to bring “down the temperature in the region.”Tensions between India and Pakistan have been spiraling since the terrorist attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir, in which gunmen killed 26 people, almost all Hindus.American diplomats have been in contact with Pakistani and Indian officials. And Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, has been in frequent contact with Indian officials to defuse the situation, American officials said.Immediately after the attack, India said the attackers had “cross-border linkages.” Pakistan disputed the charge and called for an international investigation.Indian officials said the strikes early Wednesday in Pakistan-controlled territory were aimed at destroying terrorist training camps. The Pakistani government has denied the sites had any connection with terrorist groups.Around midnight local time, India launched 78 planes to attack sites in Kashmir and Punjab, Mr. Asif said. The planes did not cross into Pakistan’s territory, he added.Mr. Asif said the Pakistani armed services reserved the right to strike at India if they detected the Indians were preparing for a further attack, but he also said Pakistan was ready to de-escalate.“Restraint is still being applied,” Mr. Asif said. “But if the same situation arises tonight, the situation could flare up very easily.”The defense minister reiterated his call for an international investigation and said he hoped U.S. officials would push India to accept such an inquiry.“The administration could suggest a commission of two or three other countries,” he said. “A credible body could be set up. We don’t want this to hang in limbo.”Both India and Pakistan have nuclear weapons, something that has increased American officials’ concerns. But Mr. Asif said he did not “foresee any risk, at the moment” of the dispute escalating to a nuclear conflict.The nuclear capabilities of the two countries, he said, were a stabilizing factor preventing disputes from escalating too much, but, he added, “the risk is always there. You can’t deny that.”Julian E. Barnes covers the U.S. intelligence agencies and international security matters for The Times.

Sindoor, or vermilion powder, is a traditional marker of the marital status of Hindu women.Credit...Manish Swarup/Associated PressMay 7, 2025Himanshi Narwal was first a symbol of tragedy, then a target of hate.Last month, Ms. Narwal was captured in an image sitting beside her slain husband, who was among 26 people killed in a terrorist attack on the Indian side of Kashmir. As India struck Pakistan on Wednesday in retaliation, Ms. Narwal became shorthand for why India picked the name “Operation Sindoor” for its military action.Sindoor, or vermilion powder, is a traditional marker of the marital status of Hindu women. Married women wear it either in the parting of their hair or on their foreheads, and they wipe it off if they become widowed. During the April 22 terrorist attack, many women lost their husbands, who were targeted because they were Hindu. But few received the media attention that Ms. Narwal has after the image of her by her husband’s side went viral.The Indian government’s choice of the name Operation Sindoor signaled its intention to avenge the widowed women. On social media, the Indian Army announced the strikes with a stark image that included a jar of spilled sindoor, which resembled spattered blood.“Operation Sindoor” also signals to right-wing Hindu groups — many of which favor more traditionally defined gender roles — that the Hindu nationalist government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is listening to their demands for vengeance.ImageCarrying the body of Vinay Narwal, a naval officer who was killed in the attack last month.Credit...Bhawika Chhabra/ReutersBut some feminists have criticized the use of the word sindoor.Hindu nationalism is predominantly driven by a male view of the world, said V.

Pakistan’s bombardment of Indian-administered Kashmir on Wednesday night was, according to locals and experts, the most intense shelling that villages and towns in the region have seen in more than 40 years.\\n“This was a night of terror,” Rameez Choudhary, a resident of Poonch, told Al Jazeera.\\nThe dead, officials told Al Jazeera, included two siblings who were crushed to death after an exploding shell dropped on their house; two local store-owners who were hit by the raining munitions; a seven-year-old child; a teenage boy; a 35-year-old homemaker; and four other men.\\nThe worst-hit villages in Poonch district were Shahpur, Mankote and Krishna Ghati, while shelling also intensified in Rajouri district’s Laam, Manjakote, and Gambhir Brahmana areas as residents fled to safety.\\nA residential house is pictured after it was damaged by cross-border shelling in Salamabad in Indian-administered Kashmir’s Baramulla district, May 7, 2025 [Reuters]\\n‘This war has been forced upon us’\\nThe border skirmishes have followed the deadly attack at the tourist resort town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir two weeks ago, in which 26 people, mostly Indian visitors holidaying in the disputed region, were killed.\\nDuring the wee hours on Wednesday, Indian military warplanes arced across the skyline and fired missiles and other munitions into neighbouring Pakistan. Indian authorities said they targeted at least nine locations inside Pakistan.\\nIndia charges Pakistan with supporting the armed group that attacked Indian tourists. Pakistan, however, has denied the accusation. India claims its missiles hit “terror base camps”, but Pakistan says the strikes killed 31 people, all of whom were “innocent civilians”.\\nThe scale and spread of the current military tensions – India struck four cities separated by hundreds of kilometres in Pakistan’s Punjab province, in addition to sites in Pakistan-administered Kashmir – make them even graver, in some ways, than the last war between the neighbours in 1999, say some experts.\\nBack then, servicemen from the Pakistani army had disguised themselves as rebel fighters and taken up positions in the snow-covered, craggy mountains of Kargil, territory under de facto Indian control, leading to a conflict. Hundreds of soldiers died on each side, but the battles were – unlike this week – contained to Kargil.\\n“This war has been forced upon us. The [Pahalgam] attack was aimed at provoking a situation in which we have no option but to strike back,” said Tara Kartha, director at the Centre for Land Warfare Studies (CLAWS), a New Delhi-based think tank, and a former official at India’s National Security Council Secretariat.\\nTo be sure, the countries came close to war in 2019 in the aftermath of the deadly attack in Pulwama town in South Kashmir when a suicide bomber blew up an Indian paramilitary motorcade, killing 40 Indian servicemen. Indian fighter jets fired missiles that struck Balakot in Pakistan-administered Kashmir.\\nBut according to Kartha, the current crisis is different.\\n“Both sides carefully managed 2019. Everything was kept confined to a certain limit. But this time, it has been brutal,” she said, while arguing that “India has been very mature”. Pakistan’s military and civilian government have, however, accused India of fanning the flames of war and escalating tensions.\\nCaught on the front lines of their confrontation are Kashmiris. On Wednesday, three different regions in Indian-administered Kashmir were struck by Pakistani shelling.\\n“Initially, we thought it was thunder.

There’s a feeling that whenever the trouble between the two warring nations has erupted in the past, it is the people of these hill regions who have borne its brunt,” he said.\\nSilent guns roar again\\nThe LoC traverses a 740km (459-mile) circuitous route through the mountains, forested ridges, alpine lakes and rivers of the disputed Kashmir region.

After the 1971 war that Pakistan lost to India, the ceasefire line was renamed as the LoC. In 2003, after a more than decade-long uprising in Kashmir began to subside, and both countries initiated a peace process to ease hostilities, India took advantage of the truce period to fence off its side of LoC with spools of concertina wire.\\nThe two countries agreed to a ceasefire deal that they renewed in 2021.\\nFour years later, that agreement effectively lies in tatters.\\nBroken glass pieces are seen on a carpet inside a residential house after it was partially damaged by cross-border shelling in Salamabad in Indian-administered Kashmir’s Baramulla district, May 7, 2025 [Reuters]\\n‘This shelling is unprecedented’\\nAmin, the villager in Chandak, said that although artillery duels have been common in the border area, the guns had fallen relatively silent since both countries reaffirmed the 2003 ceasefire deal four years ago. “We are familiar with cross-border shelling.

Though neither wants full-blown conflict, the dispute over Kashmir has produced three wars and multiple crises over eight decades. When two nuclear-armed neighbours clash, we should worry.One reason is that errors and misjudgments are always possible. Following its overnight strikes on Pakistan, which it accuses of involvement in the massacre of Hindu tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir last month, India said that it hit only terrorist infrastructure and that its actions were “not escalatory”. This is not a judgment that can be made unilaterally. Pakistan said India was “igniting an inferno” and that its military is authorised to take corresponding actions.The second cause for concern is the shifting context of the hostility. In India, Narendra Modi’s success is built on his identity as a Hindu nationalist strongman. He is also under intense pressure because he had declared unequivocally that Kashmir had returned to normalcy and would be not only “terror-free but [also] a heaven for tourists”.In Pakistan, where the military pulls the strings, the parlous state of the economy is only one cause of the generals’ unpopularity. Last month, the army chief, Asim Munir, stirred controversy by calling Kashmir Pakistan’s “jugular vein” – a loaded phrase echoing the description of its founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. That rhetoric angered India even before the Kashmir attack that came five days later.The massacre was claimed by the Resistance Front, regarded by India as a proxy of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba. Islamabad denies any link, but the military’s connections with militant groups are opaque. India is becoming increasingly blunt about attributing blame.In the past, the US has pushed the two sides to de-escalate. But the Trump administration has little attention to spare and less diplomatic capacity. It does not have an ambassador in New Delhi. Its relations with Pakistan are at a low. Europe is preoccupied by Ukraine, security and US tariffs. Beijing should press Pakistan to keep a cool head.Pakistan’s response to the strikes may soon be clearer. In the last crisis, in 2019, the two sides quietly stepped back from the brink. India can say it has struck; Pakistan says that it downed Indian jets (Indian officials have reportedly confirmed losing aircraft). Such an outcome would be a relief for civilians along the line of control – the de facto border – who are once more paying for decisions made far away as heavy artillery fire continues. But it might be only a temporary reprieve, and not for all. India’s announcement that it was suspending the Indus waters treaty – which might ultimately allow it to turn off the tap – is less dramatic than firing missiles, but could prove devastating for farmers in Pakistan.Last year, Mr Modi promised to restore the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, which his government wrongly demoted to centrally administered territories six years ago. He should do so. That decision, and the lockdown that followed, have fuelled anger and militancy. Pressure should be maintained on the Pakistani military over its dangerous accommodation of militants.The scholar Sumit Ganguly notes in his book Deadly Impasse that the two nations have often shown striking strategic restraint, but also that the dispute remains “remarkably durable”. It would be complacent to count on calibration.\\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In the attacks, Indian forces targeted what New Delhi described as “terrorist camps” in the neighboring country.The escalation follows a terrorist attack in India’s Jammu and Kashmir Union Territory that left 26 civilians dead last month. The Indian government has accused Islamabad of harboring an armed group linked to the incident and characterized the pre-dawn missile and drone strike on Wednesday as retaliation.The Pakistani National Security Committee (NSC) has dismissed India’s justification for the military action, calling it an “unprovoked, cowardly and unlawful act of war” in a statement issued after a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.Islamabad maintains the targeted sites were civilian areas and that the terrorist camps described by India are “imaginary.” Reports from Pakistan have mentioned at least 26 fatalities and 46 injuries. The NSC also claimed that Pakistani forces downed five Indian aircraft involved in the operation, including fighter jets and drones.\\n”Pakistan reserves the right to respond, in self-defense, at a time, place, and manner of its choosing,” the statement warned, urging the international community to hold New Delhi accountable for alleged violations of international law.New Delhi described its Operation Sindoor as “focused, measured and non-escalatory,” targeting locations associated with the terrorist organization Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). The April attack was claimed by a group called The Resistance Front, reportedly an offshoot of LeT, which India identified as the mastermind behind the incident.Russia has condemned the initial attack in Kashmir, with the Foreign Ministry stating that Moscow “objects to any terrorist activities and emphasizes the need for the international community to unite to effectively fight against this evil.” The country has urged both New Delhi and Islamabad to exercise restraint and pursue diplomatic solutions to their differences.\\n```\\n\\n## [Protesters demonstrate in central London after Indian missile strikes on Pakistan](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/protest-london-india-high-commission-missile-strikes-pakistan-b1226305.html) (#50755)\\n\\n> 2025-05-07 19:22:27+00:00\\n\\n```\\nProtesters have demonstrated outside the High Commission of India in support of Pakistan, after India’s missile strikes.

The agreement with Britain, which has been three years in the making, is one of several India is negotiating, including with the US and EU. It illustrates its appeal as a rising global power – the world’s most populous country and its fastest-growing major economy, which is also the fifth (and on course to be third) largest overall. In contrast, the military operations targeting Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir demonstrate how India continues to be bogged down by instabilities in its neighbourhood and held hostage to its history.India’s military actions are in response to a terrorist attack last month in which 26 tourists were killed in Indian-administered Kashmir. The name of the military operation – Sindoor – refers to a symbol of marriage, alluding to the women who lost their husbands in the attack that selectively targeted Hindu men. New Delhi says it is trying to ensure the conflict remains limited between the nuclear-armed neighbours. It says its operations have targeted terrorist infrastructure rather than military facilities, although civilian casualties have been reported, and referred to its military action as a “precision strike” that has been “focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature”.Whether it remains “non-escalatory” will depend on Pakistan’s response. The situation remains precarious amid the risk of accidental escalation, limited external pressure and both sides adopting an assertive military posture to appease their domestic political constituencies and hyper-nationalist foreign policies. In the past, the US played a prominent role in de-escalating tensions. But President Donald Trump nonchalantly referred to the current hostilities as a “a shame”, while stating earlier that both countries would sort it out in “one way or another”. In a world where the US sees international relations through the prism of “spheres of influence” – as reflected in Trump’s claims to Canada, Greenland and the Panama canal, while seeing the Russian invasion of Ukraine as Europe’s problem – there is clearly a limited appetite for Washington to get involved in South Asian geopolitics.India and Pakistan have fought three wars since they were established in 1947, two of them over Kashmir. The territory is vital to Pakistan’s security, with about 80% of the country’s cultivated land dependent on water from the Indus water system that traverses Kashmir – that’s why the recent decision by India to hold a longstanding water agreement in abeyance is seen as an existential threat to Pakistan. A week before the terrorist attack, Pakistan’s army chief, Asim Munir, referred to Kashmir as Pakistan’s “jugular vein”. Reports of critical mineral deposits in Kashmir have also elevated the strategic importance of the territory to India.However, at the heart of the tensions is the question of identity rooted in the scars of partition in 1947 that created the countries of India and Pakistan. The Pakistani state – and in particular the military and intelligence establishment – has derived legitimacy from maintaining a well-entrenched anti-India identity. The real source of authority in Pakistan is not the prime minister (Shehbaz Sharif) or the president (Asif Ali Zardari), but rather Munir and the head of the country’s intelligence service, the ISI (Muhammad Asim Malik). No civilian prime minister has completed a full term in the country’s 77-year history. If India-Pakistan relations were on good terms, there would be little justification for the military to have such a dominant role in Pakistani politics and the economy.On India’s part, the decision by the government of Narendra Modi to rescind the special autonomous status of Kashmir in 2019 , and divide the state into two territories that were directly ruled by New Delhi, fuelled tensions with Islamabad. New Delhi claims that doing this normalised Kashmir’s status, pointing to an increase in tourism and investment inflows and largely peaceful elections in the territory last year. However, last month’s terrorist attack and India and Pakistan’s tit-for-tat military responses show that Kashmir is far from normal. Moreover, local grievances remain as Kashmiri autonomy and identity have gradually been eroded in both Indian and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.These tensions are unlikely to subside anytime soon. Much like the Israel-Palestine conflict or tensions across the Taiwan Strait and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, they are rooted in longstanding historical faultlines and questions of national identity. Ultimately, India’s global aspirations remain held hostage to regional instabilities.\\nDr Chietigj Bajpaee is senior fellow for south Asia at the thinktank Chatham House\\n```\\n\\n## [India and Pakistan can ill afford war, but who will talk them down?](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/07/india-and-pakistan-can-ill-afford-war-but-who-will-talk-them-down) (#53434)\\n\\n> 2025-05-07 14:37:17+00:00\\n\\n```\\nThe uneasy calm that had settled over India and Pakistan in the past two weeks was swiftly shattered in the early hours of Wednesday morning.In the days that followed the deadly attack that killed 25 Indian tourists and a guide in Kashmir in late March, the Indian government made it clear it held Pakistan responsible – and it intended to avenge the deaths.Meanwhile, the Indian public – horrified by accounts that tourists had been targeted and shot for being Hindu – was baying for blood. Newspaper columns and nightly discussions on TV news channels rang with calls for the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to take decisive action against Pakistan and “teach them a lesson” once and for all.But a fortnight after the attack, with no clear impending action or military mobilisation in sight, some had wondered whether India really intended to retaliate. “What is going on?” asked one senior military analyst on Tuesday. By 1am on Wednesday, that question was answered.In highly coordinated air and drone strikes, Indian missiles hit nine targets, both in the part of the Kashmir region administered by Pakistan and in Pakistan’s Punjab province. It was the first time since the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war that India had fired missiles into Punjab.India said it had struck at “terrorist infrastructure”: camps and madrasas that were connected to the two main Islamist militant groups, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, behind some of the deadliest terrorist attacks in India over the past three decades. It emphasised it had not taken aim at any Pakistani military bases or weaponry. The strikes also took place entirely from Indian airspace, an apparent lesson from its last confrontation with Pakistan in 2019, when an Indian military aircraft was shot down over Pakistan and its pilot taken captive.To some, it seemed as if India was giving Pakistan an “off ramp” with these strikes, to prevent them escalating. As was widely agreed by analysts, both countries and their allies can ill afford events spiralling out of their control into an all-out hot war, not seen between the two countries since 1999.Pakistan is already in the midst of the worst security crisis in decades, as it battles a surge in Islamist militants on its Afghan border and separatists in its south-western province of Balochistan. The country is also in the grip of an economic crisis, with the Sharif coalition government widely seen as weak and unpopular.Yet in the buildup to the strikes, Pakistan’s powerful army chief, Gen Asim Munir, had already vowed that Pakistan would more than match any aggression by India. After India’s strike, Pakistan was unequivocal in its response: it was nothing short of an “act of war” by India. It furthermore claimed to have shot down five of the Indian military aircraft that carried out the attacks – which the Indian government has not so far commented on – and made it clear that it intended to go further.A statement by Pakistan’s national security council accused India of “igniting an inferno” and said the Pakistan army had been authorised to respond to defend Pakistan’s sovereignty.Pakistan’s military has long been the most powerful institution in the country. With the Sharif government weakened, the decision of how to respond is widely acknowledged to be in the hands of Munir.For those hoping for a swift de-escalation of tensions, this is a cause of concern. Munir is known to be an ideological hardliner on India and his comments on Kashmir have already been seen as highly inflammatory in Delhi. He is also known as favouring aggressive action and projections of military strength over attempts at diplomacy.“The worry here is that General Munir is not a thinking general; he’s rash, he’s reckless and he’s highly nationalistic,,” said Ayesha Siddiqua, a Pakistan political scientist. “We’ve already seen his gung-ho approach.”Pakistan’s military may also see India’s decision to strike at least three locations, including a mosque, inside Punjab as a direct provocation that could warrant a powerful retaliation.Punjab is not only the political base of the Sharif family but also the military heartland of the country, home to the majority of soldiers and the army leadership. Indian missiles have not landed there for more than 50 years.It remains unclear what targets Pakistan might aim for. While Pakistan accuses India of funding cross-border terrorism, there are no equivalent militant camps it could strike over the border. And to strike directly against Indian army targets could be seen as a direct escalation of the conflict. What analysts did agree on was that Pakistan was likely to strike sooner than later – and the longer the wait, the greater the chance of escalation.To some, the greatest worry of all is that India and Pakistan may have lost the US as a third-party mediator. In their 75 years as neighbours and enemies, Pakistan and India have been brought back from the brink of conflict on multiple occasions by crucial intervention by the US, a country that commands unmatched power and influence on both sides of the border and has always been willing to get its hands dirty in their disputes.Yet with Donald Trump in charge of the White House, the mood is very different and he has shown little interest in getting involved. “They’ve been fighting for a long time. I just hope it ends very quickly,” Trump said dismissively, after news of India’s strikes broke.Siddiqua said that without the US as a powerful, neutral mediator, altercations between the two countries – who are both looking to claim victory – could easily spiral out of control. “My worry is that, for the first time, India and Pakistan might be on their own here,” she said.\\n```\\n\\n## [India and Pakistan may have an off-ramp after their clash - will they take it?](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/india-and-pakistan-may-have-an-off-ramp-after-their-clash-will-they-take-it/RFGTDQSIJFG4VE5PTXP7X5V45E/) (#53494)\\n\\n> 2025-05-08 02:21:58+00:00\\n\\n```\\nBy Mujib Mashal and Salman MasoodNew York Times·8 May, 2025 02:21 AM7 mins to readAt least three civilians, including a child, were killed after India fired missiles at Pakistani territory early today.

But why do they dispute the territory - and how did it start?What we know about India\\'s strike on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered KashmirIndian air strikes - how will Pakistan respond? Four key questionsLIVE: Tensions escalate as Pakistan vows response to Indian strikes after Pahalgam killingsHow old is this conflict?Kashmir is an ethnically diverse Himalayan region famed for the beauty of its lakes, meadows and snow-capped mountains.Even before India and Pakistan won their independence from Britain in August 1947, the area was hotly contested.Under the partition plan provided by the Indian Independence Act, Muslim-majority Kashmir was free to accede to either India or Pakistan.The maharaja (local ruler), Hari Singh, initially wanted Kashmir to become independent - but in October 1947 chose to join India, in return for its help against an invasion of tribesmen from Pakistan.Kashmir profile - TimelineA war erupted and India asked the United Nations to intervene. The UN recommended holding a plebiscite to settle the question of whether the state would join India or Pakistan. However, the two countries could not agree to a deal to demilitarise the region before the referendum could be held.In July 1949, India and Pakistan signed an agreement to establish a ceasefire line as recommended by the UN and the region became divided.AFPKashmir is known by some as India\\'s Switzerland, due to its verdant fields and sweeping mountainscapesA second war followed in 1965. Then in 1999, India fought a brief but bitter conflict with Pakistani-backed forces.By that time, India and Pakistan were declared nuclear powers. Today, Delhi and Islamabad both claim Kashmir in full, but control only parts of it.Why has there been so much unrest in the Indian-administered part?Within Indian-administered Kashmir, opinions about the territory\\'s rightful allegiance are diverse and strongly held. Many do not want it to be governed by India, or prefer a return to the semi-autonomous status that they had until 2019. Some also want outright independence.Religion is also an important factor: Indian-administered Kashmir is more than 60% Muslim, making it the only part of India where Muslims are in the majority.An armed revolt has been waged against Indian rule in the region since 1989, claiming tens of thousands of lives.India accuses Pakistan of backing militants in Kashmir - a charge its neighbour denies.In 2019, Indian-administered Kashmir was stripped of its semi-autonomous status by the government in Delhi amid a huge security crackdown.For several years after the revocation of the region\\'s special status, militancy waned and tourist visits soared.What happened after previous Kashmir militant attacks?In 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the Line of Control - the de facto border between India and Pakistan - targeting alleged militant bases.In 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left more than 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted Indian airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.Tensions rose again in April 2025 after years of relative calm when militants killed 26 people in an attack on tourists near the resort town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir. It was the deadliest attack on civilians in two decades.India responded two weeks later with missile strikes on targets in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, once again raising fears of further escalation and calls for restraint.Kashmir remains one of the most militarised zones in the world.What about hopes for peace?India and Pakistan did agree a ceasefire in 2003.In 2014, India\\'s current Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power promising a tough line on Pakistan, but also showed interest in holding peace talks.GettyPakistan and India\\'s prime ministers promised peace in 2014Nawaz Sharif, then prime minister of Pakistan, attended Modi\\'s swearing-in ceremony in Delhi.But a year later, India blamed Pakistan-based groups for an attack on its airbase in Pathankot in the northern state of Punjab. Modi also cancelled a scheduled visit to the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, for a regional summit in 2017.Since then, there hasn\\'t been any progress in talks between the neighbours.\\n```\\n\\n## [‘Absolutely not’: India coach’s massive call on Pakistan matches as political tensions escalate](https://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/indian-coach-makes-massive-call-on-pakistan-matches-as-political-tensions-escalate/news-story/f25dfd4ea3dec11660f3c0096c4d4c70) (#53955)\\n\\n> 2025-05-07 01:09:00+00:00\\n\\n```\\nIndian coach Gautam Gambhir has called for a cease to cricket matches against Pakistan as tensions between the two Asian nations continue to escalate.On Wednesday, India fired missiles at territory in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir in what was described as “precision strikes at terrorist camps”.

Get your first month for just $1. Limited time offer >“Pakistan has every right to respond forcefully to this act of war imposed by India, and a forceful response is being given,” Pakistan Prime Minister Shebaz Sharif tweeted, labelling the attacks as “cowardly”.“The entire nation stands with the Pakistani armed forces, and the morale and spirit of the entire Pakistani nation are high.“The Pakistani nation and the Pakistani armed forces know how to deal with the enemy.“We will never allow the enemy to succeed in their nefarious goals.”Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif told AFP: “We won’t take long to settle the score.”The missile strike comes after last month’s terror attack in a tourist hotspot in Indian-run Kashmir, where 26 people were killed by gunmen. Although no group has claimed responsibility, the Indian government blamed Islamabad for backing the deadly attack, accusations that Pakistan rejected.India’s head coach Gautam Gambhir. Photo by Saeed KHAN / AFPSource: AFPIn the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attack, Gambhir has called for a complete halt to cricket engagements with Pakistan, including at neutral venues.India has not played any bilateral cricket against Pakistan since 2013, but the two nations have continued facing each other in ICC tournaments such as the recent Champions Trophy.“My personal answer to this is absolutely no ... there should not be anything between India and Pakistan,” Gambhir responded when asked whether India should continue playing Pakistan at neutral venues on Tuesday.“Ultimately, this is government’s decision whether we play them or not. I have said this before also, no cricket match or Bollywood or any other interaction is more important than the life of Indian soldiers and Indian citizens. Matches will keep happening, movies will be made, singers will continue to perform, but nothing comes close to losing a loved one in your family.“This is not up to me, it’s not in my jurisdiction, this is for BCCI and more importantly, the government to decide whether we should play them or not.“Whatever decision they make, we should be absolutely fine with it and not politicise it.”India and Pakistan are expected to play each other at the upcoming Asia Cup, this year’s Women’s World Cup and next year’s Men’s T20 World Cup.The South Asian neighbours have fought multiple wars since gaining independence from the British in 1947. For days, the international community has piled pressure on Pakistan and India to step back from the brink of war.“The world cannot afford a military confrontation between India and Pakistan,” a spokesperson for UN chief Antonio Guterres said in a statement.Asked about the strikes, US President Donald Trump told reporters in Washington he hopes the fighting “ends very quickly”.“It’s a shame, we just heard about it,” he said.“I guess people knew something was going to happen based on the past. They’ve been fighting for many, many decades and centuries, actually, if you really think about it.”\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

The Gunners were beaten in Paris on Wednesday night, going down 3-1 on aggregate to miss out on a trip to Munich later this month. And the disappointment of another near-miss took its toll on his players after the match.The Arsenal manager also claimed that PSG staff told him the Premier League giants were the better team for much of the two legs, despite losing 1-0 at the Emirates and 2-1 at the Parc des Princes. Arsenal had 19 shots in the second leg but managed just four on target with Gianluigi Donnarumma producing some brilliant saves to prevent a comeback following a strong start from the north Londoners. Fabian Ruiz doubled PSG\\'s advantage before an Achraf Hakimi finish all but killed the tie despite Bukayo Saka\\'s goal restoring some hope.Asked post-match if he felt his Arsenal players still have \\'the hunger in their eyes\\' after more frustration in their quest for a major trophy, Arteta responded: \"Today I see how much they want it because they [Arsenal players] were in tears.\"The Spaniard then said that members of the PSG staff had told him and his backroom team that the visitors were the better side. \"I think so yeah [we were better]. Especially for 160 minutes. They told us,\" he said.\"I congratulate PSG for being in the final. I think we deserve much more. The MVP in the two games has been the goalkeeper. He has won the game for them.\"You have to arrive in this competition at this stage with a full squad. I am so upset, so annoyed that we didn\\'t manage to do that. I feel proud because no one expected it [Arsenal to reach the final]. We were very close to making it happen.\"Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice told TNT Sports: \"I thought we were dominant today, if we score one of them chances in the first 15-20 minutes then the game changes. It was two mistakes from us and two goals for them. We gave it everything but it wasn\\'t meant to be.Arsenal lost 2-1 in Paris after a 1-0 first-leg loss in London (Image: GETTY)\"Over the two legs we could\\'ve scored more goals but Donnarumma has been unbelievable and it wasn\\'t meant to be.

It’s just the small margins in football.“Two mistakes from us, two goals for them. With the chances we missed, it just felt like it wasn’t meant to be. “We gave it absolutely everything, this competition you’re either in or you’re out. Over the two legs we could\\'ve scored three or four goals to be honest but [Gianluigi] Donnarumma has been unbelievable and you’ve got to look at the small margins. It just obviously wasn\\'t meant to be.\"In life in general, sometimes you have to lose a few in order to win and you have to overcome some of these setbacks to mentally grow as a person, as a player and as a group.“We\\'re going through that stage at the minute after a few losses in terms of losing out on the league and coming close in the Champions League in back-to-back years.“We\\'re growing as a team, as people, but we need to keep pushing and keep believing. This is why we play this sport, there are going to be setbacks along the way.“PSG have obviously gone through tonight, we\\'re absolutely gutted but this isn’t going to define us for sure. We\\'re going to be back and when we get our players back who have been out for a very long time, we are going to be a much stronger outfit so we’ve got to keep going.”Rice admitted that it has been a struggle for Arsenal to play so much of the season without so many key players, but said they fully believed they could complete their comeback mission in Paris.\"It\\'s tough,” he continued. “We\\'ve done the whole season without five or six of our best players and to be where we are and do what we\\'ve done has been unbelievable. I fully stand by that.“In the end the group of players who have gone out there have given it absolutely everything, the whole squad has, even the players that flew over with us tonight that have been injured, every staff member. “Everyone fully believed and I think you could see that from the first whistle, how much we believed we could win and go out there and put on a performance.“On another night we maybe score two or three, it was just that first 20 minutes where they score and we don\\'t take our chances and it’s a real kick in the teeth.“We’ll assess it, we\\'ll be back. Three games left, it\\'s been a really long season, we really, really wanted this one, but we keep pushing because this is why we play this sport. We want to win and do the best we can.\"On continuing their run without a trophy under Arteta, Rice added: “We\\'re all desperate for it. That\\'s why we play football, we want to win trophies, we want to be at the pinnacle, winning stuff.“For whatever reason, these last two years in the cup competitions and the Premier League, it hasn\\'t been meant to be.“We\\'ve been really, really close and it\\'s obviously not good enough, because Arsenal are a club that deserve to be winning trophies and deserve to be pushing and there’s not a lot more we can really be doing.“Sometimes in life you have to go through these small losses in order to win big. That’s what a lot of these big superstars have done in the past, they have all suffered defeats to then come out on top.“It hurts, you see the boys in there, the manager. It’s tough, it’s a semi-final. We wanted to be in Munich and it’s obviously not meant to be but this doesn\\'t define us and we\\'ll be back for sure.\"Rice’s midfield colleague Martin Odegaard, meanwhile, challenged Arsenal to channel the pain of their semi-final loss into a force for good moving forward.\"We gave it a proper go,” the captain said. “I think we started the game really well. We were on the front foot, had the momentum, a few big moments and chances but in the end it wasn\\'t enough.“Between the boxes we did really well, inside the boxes over the two games we weren\\'t good enough. Credit to their goalkeeper as well who made some amazing saves. It wasn\\'t enough and that\\'s painful.\"In the boxes, especially today what we did with the ball between the boxes, how we dominated, how we took the control of the game from the start and created some big moments. We were not strong enough and sharp enough in front of the goals and I think that\\'s where we lost it.\"It\\'s painful, very painful. We wanted to do the big thing, it was a big goal in the league and also here in the Champions League. Massive disappointment but we have to stay strong and stay together. We have to take the lessons, take that pain and use it and come back stronger.\"We have to learn from this. We did a lot of good things but it\\'s not enough. Especially in front of the goals, it’s where the games are decided and that\\'s where we have to be even sharper and get more out of all the good things we did. That’s where we have to improve and use this pain in a good way and come back stronger.”\\n```\\n\\n## [\\'Their best player has been the goalkeeper\\': Mikel Arteta insists Arsenal were \\'a lot closer\\' than...](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-14689599/Mikel-Arteta-Arsenal-Gianluigi-Donnarumma.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490) (#52892)\\n\\n> 2025-05-08 00:06:25+00:00\\n\\n```\\n\\'Their best player has been the goalkeeper\\': Mikel Arteta insists Arsenal were \\'a lot closer\\' than the result suggested against PSG and Gianluigi Donnarumma was the difference maker\\n23:59, 07 May 2025, updated\\n01:06, 08 May 2025\\nBy\\nADAM POGRUND\\nArsenal were dumped out of the Champions League by Paris Saint-Germain\\xa0Mikel Arteta has claimed that goalkeeper Donnarumma was PSG\\'s best player\\xa0LISTEN NOW: It\\'s All Kicking Off!

I am very proud of the players‘After 20 minutes it should have been 3-0. There is something extra you need to go your way in the competition and it didn’t. We were very close and for long periods of both games we were much better than them but we are not there and that has to hurt.‘I don’t think there’s been a better team [than Arsenal] in the competition from what I have seen, but we are out,’ he added. Arsenal will go another season without a trophy after being knocked out of the semi-finals Donnarumma saved from Gabriel Martinelli when Arsenal were piling on the pressure early on Bukayo Saka eventually found a way past the Italian goalkeeper but it proved to be too little ‘This competition is about the boxes and in both boxes are the strikers and the goalkeepers and there’s was the best in both games.‘But I am so proud of the players. They deserve a lot of credit for what they are doing in the context of the situation and the amount of injuries, probably the worst state you could arrive here as a team.‘To come here with a different context and still do that, it gives me a lot of positives for the future but tonight I am very upset.’PSG went ahead on the night with a spectacular first-half strike from Fabian Ruiz.Achraf Hakimi curled in a second on the 72nd minute, taking the game out of reach, after Thomas Partey failed to clear the a weak cross from\\xa0Khvicha Kvaratskhelia.Saka beat Donnarumma with a late strike and David Raya saved Vitinha\\'s spot kick but it wasn\\'t enough for the Gunners to reach their first Champions League final since 2006.\\xa0It means Arsenal trophy drought will go on for another season, with their last piece of silverware an FA Cup in Arteta\\'s first year at the Emirates.Meanwhile, PSG have now beaten three Premier League sides in the knockouts and are hoping to become the first French team to win the competition in 32 years.

Arsenal need to sign players for the here and now to win the Premier League... so, should they sign Harry Kane?\\nAnother season without a trophy sank towards an agonising anti-climax for Arsenal in the Parc des Princes on Wednesday night, two steps short of the glittering Champions League prize they craved, a string of missed chances away from shedding the reputation of chokers and nearly-men that hangs around their necks like millstones.Of the \\'magic moments\\' that Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta and his midfield general Declan Rice had dreamed of and hoped for and mythologised on the eve of this semi-final second leg in the City of Light, there were none.Not for Arsenal anyway. Not until it was too late. By the time Bukayo Saka, their best player, pulled a goal back 15 minutes from time, PSG had put the tie out of reach with brilliant strikes from Fabian Ruiz and Achraf Hakimi.That does not mean Arsenal did not produce a performance to be proud of in a 2-1 defeat that left them 3-1 losers on aggregate. Their players poured their hearts and souls into this tie. All of them. And they outplayed PSG for swathes of the match, too. Their pressing was super-human, in the first half, in particular.They were heartbreakingly close to getting to their first Champions League final for 19 years but until Saka\\'s 76th minute strike, they could not convert all their possession and dominance into goals. They missed chances they had to score. They were denied by the brilliance of PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.After everything, it came down to this: PSG took their chances. Arsenal did not. Not until the game was gone. They still lack that edge that makes the difference between triumph and disaster. They do not have a ruthless goalscorer. It is the most important skill of all and Arsenal lack it. It is why they were not good enough here. Declan Rice and Co found themselves up against a more clinical opponent in PSG Thomas Partey looked devastated to be on the losing side and was embraced by Mikel Arteta PSG players partied on the pitch after securing their place in the Champions League final If anything, their failure was a failure of recruitment. Arteta spoke afterwards of how Arsenal had been the better team for 160 minutes of the two legs. Even if that were true, it means little. They had chances that could have changed the game, chances that might have shaped a different destiny. They could not take them. Moments like those decide ties like this.Even after he had pulled one back, Saka missed a golden opportunity to score again, skying Riccardo Calafiori\\'s cross over the bar. And so the debate about whether they were undone again by the lack of a conventional centre forward will rage on. It is something they must fix in the summer.For PSG, a date with Inter Milan in Munich at the end of the month and the chance to win their first Champions League awaits. All that remains for Arsenal now is the sad, desultory crawl to the end of the season and the imperative of holding on to a place in the top five.Some, in the midst of their disappointment, will call, absurdly, for Arteta to be sacked. That would be a huge mistake. There is much to be optimistic about for next season. Saka, William Saliba, Myles Lewis-Skelly, Declan Rice and Martin Odegaard can be the core of a team that breaks its drought next season.It was said last month that this Arsenal team had come of age when they beat Real Madrid home and away in the quarter-finals and looked hugely impressive doing so. Then, when they lost the first leg of the semi-finals against PSG last week, the siren voices started singing in their ears.Maybe Madrid aren\\'t what they used to be. Maybe the win in the Bernabeu wasn\\'t quite as significant as it seemed. Maybe it was another false dawn. Maybe, as Wayne Rooney suggested, Arsenal were afraid of putting everything on the line to win the biggest prize of them all.That seemed to be another way of saying that PSG are a better team than Real Madrid. Luis Enrique\\'s side has been the best side in Europe in the second half of this season. Save a wobble in the second leg of their quarter-final against Aston Villa, they have looked irresistible.After the magnificent white-knuckle ride of Inter\\'s victory over PSG at the San Siro on Tuesday evening, Arsenal knew they needed something exceptional of their own to make it into the final. Arteta said his team needed to \\'elevate\\' itself to a new level. Achraf Hakimi scored with a powerful effort to put PSG 3-0 ahead on aggregate Bukayo Saka\\'s goal had given Arsenal a glimmer of hope later in the game but it proved to be a mere consolation Mikel Arteta consoled Saka at full time, with the Gunners well beaten over two legs The atmosphere was electric and it was a cauldron for the Gunners to play in Fabian scored the opener for PSG after Arsenal had enjoyed a brilliant start to the match They had nearly got the dream start they craved. Jurrien Timber dispossessed Khvicha Kvaratskhelia on the edge of the PSG box in the third minute and crossed to the back post. Rice rose above Marquinhos six yards out but directed his header agonisingly wide.A minute later, Arsenal nearly scored again. Thomas Partey, who was so sorely missed in the first leg, launched a long throw into the box and Gabriel Martinelli met it on the run and on the volley a few yards out. Either side of Donnarumma and it would have been a goal but the ball was straight at him and Donnarumma produced a fine save to keep it out.

PSG missed the cleverness of the injured Ousmane Dembele, the closest thing they have to a talisman. Arsenal laid siege to the home goal in front of the Virage Auteuil where the ultras had bounced and yelled and roared in a riot of anticipation before the match. Now they were reduced to sullen whistles as the danger Arsenal posed them became evident.PSG hardly saw the ball. They were grateful to their goalkeeper again after seven minutes. Martin Odegaard unleashed a piledriver from the edge of the box that looked like a goal from the moment it left his boot but Donnarumma flung himself to his left to turn the ball wide. It was a world class save.When PSG finally broke free, they showed just how potent their own attacking threat can be. Kvaratskhelia made the chance out of nothing, stepping inside Timber 25 yards out and curling a beautiful shot beyond David Raya but off the face of the post. That reassured the home supporters. They found new voice.PSG gradually gained a foothold in the game and when Rice was booked for a foul on Kvaratskhelia on the left side of the Arsenal box, they sensed opportunity. Arsenal failed to clear Vitinha’s free-kick properly and Fabian Ruiz controlled 20 yards out and lashed an unstoppable shot past Raya via a deflection off Saliba.‘The Champions League is decided in the boxes,’ said Arteta.\\xa0‘The result should have been very different. I am so upset and annoyed that we didn’t do it.’\\xa0 The Spaniard connected sweetly after a corner was headed into his path on the edge of the box The PSG fans generated an extraordinary atmosphere and their side led at the break Gianluigi Donnarumma came up with some exceptional saves to deny the Gunners PSG will enter the final as favourites and Luis Enrique has them fantastically set up Martin Odegaard looked dejected at full time as he was embraced by his manager Arsenal thought they had found a way back midway through the half when Saka stepped inside Nuno Mendes on the PSG left and sent a left-foot shot arrowing towards the top corner. Once again, their hearts were broken by Donnarumma, who arched his back and pulled off a fantastic finger-tip save.Arsenal escaped the blow that might have extinguished their hopes completely when PSG were awarded a penalty because a shot from Achraf Hakimi had brushed Lewis-Skelly’s hand on the way through to Raya. VAR alerted the referee to it and he gave a penalty. It was ridiculously harsh and a measure of justice was served when Vitinha’s weak spot-kick was saved by Raya.\\xa0 It\\xa0was only a brief reprieve. Dembele came on and with his first touch, he played the ball into the path of Hakimi just inside the Arsenal box and Hakimi curled it past Raya into the bottom corner.Saka’s goal, taking the ball around Donnarumma, and squeezing the ball home, was nothing more than a consolation, even if his later chance might have changed things. Arsenal were close but not close enough.\\n```\\n\\n## [Rio Ferdinand posts two-word tweet on Paris Saint-Germain\\'s controversial penalty decision from his...](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-14689193/Rio-Ferdinand-posts-two-word-tweet-Paris-Saint-Germains-controversial-penalty-decision-hospital-bed-missing-Champions-League-clash-Arsenal.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490) (#52904)\\n\\n> 2025-05-07 22:25:36+00:00\\n\\n```\\nRio Ferdinand posts two-word tweet on Paris Saint-Germain\\'s controversial penalty decision from his hospital bed - after missing out on Champions League clash with Arsenal\\n22:00, 07 May 2025, updated\\n23:25, 07 May 2025\\nBy\\nTAMARA PRENN\\nParis Saint-Germain booked spot in the Champions League final with home winDefeat means Arsenal will again end the season without major silverware\\xa0LISTEN NOW:\\xa0It\\'s All Kicking Off!

Arsenal need to sign players for the here and now to win the Premier League... so, should they sign Harry Kane?\\nMikel Arteta has admitted he has regrets over a key decision he made earlier this season that has come back to haunt Arsenal.\\xa0After finishing second behind Manchester City in each of the last two seasons, many believed this could finally be Arsenal\\'s year to win the Premier League.However, the Gunners have ended up falling well short, with Liverpool wrapping up the title with four games to spare last week.Arteta has previously bemoaned refereeing decisions that went against his side in the opening weeks of the campaign, but his team have also been hit by injuries, and he feels one particular setback has proved costly.Gabriel Jesus suffered a season-ending knee injury in Arsenal\\'s FA Cup penalty shootout defeat by Manchester United in January after returning to his best form, and Arteta has revealed he wishes he\\'d substituted the Brazilian striker earlier in the game.Asked on the Men in Blazers podcast if he had made any mistakes that he would like to change if he could, Arteta replied: \\'Possibly yes. It’s very difficult to understand that, but if I could pause the game and say \"Gabriel Jesus, we brought you back to life, you are doing incredibly well, you’re now going to get injured\", I would say \"stop, we are going to swap him, bring another player in and continue to play the game\". Mikel Arteta has revealed the decision he regrets from this season at Arsenal Arteta admitted he wishes he had taken Gabriel Jesus off before he suffered a season-ending knee injury against Manchester United in January Arsenal went on to lose on penalties to United, and have been forced to play without a recognised striker in recent months following the injury to Jesus \\'Unfortunately we cannot do this. It is not like VAR where we can overturn the decisions like this. The decision is made there is no way back.\\'Jesus had scored six goals in as many games prior to his injury, but has been out of action for the past four months, and is not due to return until the latter stages of 2025.Just one month after Jesus injured his knee, Kai Havertz tore his hamstring during a warm-weather training camp in Dubai, leaving Arsenal without a recognised striker after they opted not to dip into the transfer market in January.Arteta has been forced to push Mikel Merino into attack, and the Spaniard has stepped up to score six goals following his change of position. However, goals have been hard to come by at times without Jesus or Havertz up top, and Arsenal looked particularly toothless in the final third during their 1-0 defeat by PSG last week.They will get the chance for redemption in Paris tonight as they bid to make their first Champions League final in 19 years, but will once again have to rely on deploying a makeshift centre forward after losing Jesus and Havertz to injury.\\n```\\n\\n## [Martin Keown says one Arsenal star \\'won\\'t sleep\\' after PSG defeat in Champions League](https://metro.co.uk/2025/05/07/martin-keown-says-arsenal-star-wont-sleep-psg-defeat-champions-league-23045564/) (#53027)\\n\\n> 2025-05-07 21:32:03+00:00\\n\\n```\\nMartin Keown speaking after Arsenal’s defeat to PSG (Picture: X)\\nMartin Keown said Arsenal star Bukayo Saka ‘won’t sleep’ after the Gunners were knocked out of the Champions League by PSG.\\nMikel Arteta’s side travelled to Paris hoping to overturn a one-goal deficit and book their place in the Champions League final.\\nBut it was Paris Saint-Germain who set up an intriguing final against Inter Milan, Luis Enrique’s men beating Arsenal 2-1 on the night and 3-1 on aggregate.\\nFabian Ruiz’s superb strike put PSG in control of the second leg clash and Achraf Hakimi appeared to put the tie to bed when he doubled the hosts’ lead on 72 minutes.\\nSaka pulled a goal back, however, before missing an open goal which would have set up an incredibly nervy finale at Parc des Princes.\\nGet personalised updates on Arsenal everyday\\nWake up to find news on your club in your inbox every morning with Metro’s Football Newsletter.\\nSign up to our newsletter and then select your team in the link we’ll send you so we can get football news tailored to you.\\n‘It was a painful miss,’ Arsenal legend Keown said on TNT Sports after his former club fell short of the Champions League final.\\nBukayo Saka looks dejected after PSG’s win (Picture: Getty)\\n‘It was painful and it will hurt Saka.

We should be celebrating that a Labour government has furthered free trade in the national interest outside the EU.”\\n```\\n\\n## [Has UK-India trade deal ‘sold out British workers’ as Farage and Badenoch claim?](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/07/has-the-uk-india-trade-deal-sold-out-british-workers-as-farage-and-badenoch-claim) (#47790)\\n\\n> 2025-05-07 18:48:36+00:00\\n\\n```\\nA multibillion-pound free trade agreement with India has long been touted as a big Brexit boon.Cheaper clothes and shoes for British shoppers, a huge market for scotch whisky producers and luxury carmakers, and billions of pounds worth of extra trade are among the benefits of the agreement, which was finalised this week.But all these have been overshadowed by a row over national insurance contributions (NICs). The government gave in to a demand that when Indian workers are seconded to the UK on short-term visas, both they and their employers should be exempted from NICs for up to three years. They will make social security payments in India instead – and the reverse applies to British workers in India.The concession has been seized on by senior Tories, with Kemi Badenoch calling it “two-tier taxes”. Nigel Farage said Keir Starmer had “sold out British workers to the highest degree”. Critics have also raised questions about the deal’s implications for immigration and farming. But do their claims stack up?National insuranceThe NICs concession is expected to cost the exchequer about £100m in lost revenue, a government source told the Guardian.Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, told broadcasters on Wednesday that this was “less than a tenth” of the £1bn in additional tax revenue the deal is expected to bring, and that it would affect about 20,000 Indian workers currently in the UK.Farage has claimed that half a million Indians arrived in the UK over the past two years and that “this deal will throw the doors open even wider” and make it cheaper to hire Indian workers over British ones – but all this is misleading, as most Indians applying for jobs based in the UK will not benefit at all.In the grand scheme of government spending, £100m is small change, but ministers have so far refused to publish their assessment of the costs or impact the concession could have on the number of Indians who come to the UK temporarily on company transfers. This has fuelled speculation.Ministers have, however, pointed out that reciprocal tax agreements of this kind – which are called double contribution conventions and are intended to stop workers temporarily seconded abroad from being taxed twice – are not uncommon.The UK already has them with more than 50 countries, including the US, Canada and Japan. India has existing social security agreements with several European countries, such as Germany, France and the Netherlands.The issue was also on the table during the talks under the Conservatives while Badenoch was trade secretary. A senior Indian official told the Financial Times that the Tory leader was talking “rubbish” as she had agreed with the principle of exempting temporary Indian employees from NICs.Nonetheless, India’s boastful press release – calling the concession an “unprecedented achievement” that would “make Indian service providers significantly more competitive in the UK” – has made the politics of this awkward for the government.And the fact that Rachel Reeves raised national insurance contributions for employers in her budget, a tax rise that only kicked in last month, means the wider context for it is particularly damaging.Finally, the NICs issue was one of the longest-running sticking points in the trade talks and emerged as the final hurdle last week before negotiators agreed the deal. This demonstrates that it is a significant concession and one the government dug its heels in over.VisasThe fact that the deal does not include substantial numbers of extra visas for Indian workers – a key ask by Delhi in its trade negotiations – is a win.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionLabour has claimed that the Conservatives put visas on the table during their talks and that the current government secured a deal without changing its immigration policy.One existing visa route for yoga instructors, musicians and chefs to come to the UK will be opened to Indian applicants, but they will need to meet the usual salary and skills requirements. The route is capped at 1,800 visas a year.This is a long way from India’s initial demands, but that has not stopped Farage and some senior Tories from claiming the deal will lead to an influx of Indian immigrants.ServicesMajor service industries including the financial and legal sectors are not included in the deal, which has drawn criticism.In parallel with the trade deal, negotiators have been trying to strike a bilateral investment treaty with India, which would benefit the City of London. Rishi Sunak came close to finalising an agreement while he was prime minister last spring but wanted more for the services sector, which accounts for 80% of the economy.Given the impact of Donald Trump’s tariffs, however, Labour ministers decided it was worth getting the tariff-busting deal over the line by separating it from the investment treaty. It offers some benefits to the services sector, most significantly by opening up some Indian government procurement for British firms for the first time, but by and large, the deal cuts tariffs on goods.AgricultureThe deal will reduce UK import taxes on some Indian agricultural products, including frozen prawns. This has raised alarm about the implications for British farming.Officials have said the deal will benefit farmers by lifting India’s tariffs on British food exports, including lamb. Meanwhile, the UK is keeping tariffs in place on some agricultural products such as milled rice, where Indian exports could be damaging to British producers.\\n```\\n\\n## [UK and EU split over youth mobility deal, negotiating document shows](https://www.ft.com/content/f2a5e12f-0599-4f7d-a3ec-6db7050df2a0) (#50659)\\n\\n> 2025-05-07 18:06:07+00:00\\n\\n```\\nThe UK and the EU are deeply split over the terms of a youth mobility scheme that is a key part of a post-Brexit “reset” agreement, fresh negotiating documents show.\\xa0With only two weeks to go until a crucial London summit kicking off formal negotiations, the two remain far apart on a deal to allow 18 to 30-year-olds on both sides of the Channel to travel and work more freely in each other’s countries.The EU is demanding a “dedicated visa” to enable young people to work, study or “simply travel” in the UK as long as they have sufficient funds, according to a draft document discussed by EU ambassadors on Wednesday. It also proposes that EU students should return to paying the same £9,535 fees to attend British universities as home students.A UK “counterproposal” suggests the two sides “explore” a much narrower scheme that is “time-limited [and] capped” and would mean visitors had “no right to bring dependants or access benefits”, the document adds. The UK government has repeatedly rejected Brussels’ version of a youth mobility deal arguing that it is too close to restoring the “free movement of people” that was ended by the 2016 Brexit vote.\\xa0Instead, the UK said it would push for a deal to improve the rights for musicians and other touring artists. The proposed text says only that the European Commission proposes to “provide clear information to artists” on rules they need to comply with.Brussels also wants the UK to work towards rejoining the “Erasmus+” student exchange programme, the document states — though European relations minister Nick Thomas-Symonds this week told the Financial Times there were no plans to rejoin. At their summit on May 19 at Lancaster House, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will announce a new security and defence partnership, alongside a plan for a new EU-UK “common understanding”.The documents set out plans to deepen co-operation in areas including energy, emissions trading, co-operation on crime fighting and tackling illegal migration, along with removing barriers to trade in food and animal products.The UK has asked for “more flexibility” than EU countries to impose controls on food and plant imports. But the document states that the UK must accept so-called “dynamic alignment” that would result in it automatically following EU rules, and requests an “adequate financial contribution” to pay for the EU’s work in that area.\\xa0In a win for London, it adds that any food agreement will be governed by an “independent arbitration panel”, which avoids the European Court of Justice having direct jurisdiction over the UK.London officials would be involved in early stage drafting of new laws covered by dynamic alignment, in a sign that any veterinary deal following EU rules will inevitably pull the two sides closer together.\\xa0The UK would also be required to make “adequate financial contribution” to any European emissions trading system if the pair chose to link their separate programmes, the document states. Beyond the disagreements on trade and mobility, the two sides will also agree on an expansive security and defence partnership that will create regular meetings, repairing what one UK diplomat called the “institutional rupture” caused by Brexit.\\xa0According to the draft text, the UK and EU will establish a six-monthly “foreign policy dialogue” between the British foreign secretary and the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs.\\xa0The EU will also “regularly” invite the UK to high-level meetings, including the quarterly meetings of the European Council of EU leaders, alongside an annual defence dialogue, training exchanges and possible staff secondments.\\xa0A UK government spokesperson said any final deal would be in “the national interest”, adding: “These are EU internal draft texts. No final agreement has been made.”\\n```\\n\\n## [Deep concerns over UK visa policy expressed by Lords as Government\\'s new immigration plans set to be revealed](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/lords-concern-uk-visa-policy-government-new-immigration-plans-b1226311.html) (#50736)\\n\\n> 2025-05-08 05:07:28+00:00\\n\\n```\\nPeers have warned that the UK’s work visa policy is creating “unnecessarily high barriers” for Britain to attract global talent. The Lords Science and Technology Committee has written to the Prime Minster, Home Secretary, Chancellor and Science Minister to say reforms are urgently needed following increasing global competition for STEM workers. The committee argues that funding policies under Donald Trump’s US administration have left many American scientists seeking to relocate to other countries. Other nations, including France, Germany, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Canada and Australia, have already announced programmes to encourage them to move there. Britain is set miss out because of a complex and costly process that means UK visa fees for scientists are amongst the highest in the world, the committee warns. It is planning to publish its Immigration White Paper next week, which will lay out the details of Sir Keir Starmer’s plan to reduce immigration. In his letter published on Wednesday, committee chair Lord Robert Mair, said: “The Government must seize this rare opportunity to rectify the situation where it is putting up unnecessarily high barriers to the global talent that want to live and work here, harming the national interest and in stark contrast to the actions of other nations. “At a time of dramatic geopolitical and technological change, our action––or inaction––right now will have a huge impact on our future. We cannot afford business as usual.”Visas for science, research and engineering roles fell by a third in the second half last year compared to the period in 2023. Lord Mair added: “We understand that the Government was elected on a pledge to reduce overall immigration numbers–but the Global Talent visa accounts for only around 4,000 people a year, less than 1% of the overall figures in 2024.“Reducing overall net migration is therefore not incompatible with increasing the proportion of science and technology experts who receive visas.”As part of the Government’s immigration crackdown, visa applications from nationalities considered most likely to overstay and claim asylum in Britain could be restricted. In its manifesto, Labour promised that it would bring down the numbers of people coming into the country from abroad. The party said that the overall level of net migration “must be properly controlled and managed”.UK visa applications have significantly fallen in recent months, particularly for those coming for jobs in the NHS and social care, after tough new restrictions on eligibility were introduced in early 2024 under the previous Government.But asylum applications have rocketed. Home Office figures show a total of 108,138 people applied for asylum in Britain in 2024, the highest number for any 12-month period since current records began in 2001.A Home Office spokesman said: “To tackle abuse by foreign nationals who arrive on work and study visas and go on to claim asylum, we are building intelligence on the profile of these individuals to identify them earlier and faster.“We keep the visa system under constant review and will where we detect trends, which may undermine our immigration rules, we will not hesitate to take action. “Under our plan for change, our upcoming Immigration White Paper will set out a comprehensive plan to restore order to our broken immigration system.”\\n```\\n\\n## [Fury at \\'two-tier Keir\\'s\\' tax break for Indian workers that will make it cheaper to employ foreign...](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14685253/Fury-two-tier-Keirs-tax-break-Indian-worker.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490) (#50855)\\n\\n> 2025-05-07 08:01:41+00:00\\n\\n```\\nFury at \\'two-tier Keir\\'s\\' tax break for Indian workers that will make it cheaper to employ foreign staff - as bosses warn they will be forced to slash jobs\\n00:43, 07 May 2025, updated\\n09:01, 07 May 2025\\nBy\\nCLAIRE ELLICOT WHITEHALL EDITOR\\nKeir Starmer was last night accused of undercutting British workers to seal a £5 billion trade deal with India.Under the agreement, tens of thousands of temporary Indian workers will be exempt from paying National Insurance in Britain, making them cheaper to hire.New Delhi heralded the deal as an ‘unprecedented’ win, but the UK Prime Minister was accused of introducing ‘two-tier taxes’ after National Insurance contributions for British firms were increased in last year’s Budget.Many companies warned they will be forced to slash jobs or even shut down. Separately, the agreement said there would be more visas for yoga teachers as they were now classed as ‘skilled workers’, alongside chefs and musicians, capped at 1,800 a year.The row comes just days after Labour was battered in the local elections by voters who turned to Reform UK over concerns about immigration.Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch refused to agree to the deal when she was trade secretary over the NI issue and concerns about visas and fairness.‘This is two-tier taxes from two-tier Keir,’ she said.\\xa0‘When Labour negotiates, Britain loses.’ PM Keir Starmer calls Narendra Modi, his Indian counterpart, before announcing a trade agreement whereby\\xa0tens of thousands of temporary Indian workers will be exempt from paying National Insurance in Britain The Labour leader was last night accused of undercutting British workers to seal a £5 billion trade deal with India New Delhi heralded the deal as an ¿unprecedented¿ win, but the UK Prime Minister was accused of introducing ¿two-tier taxes¿ (pictured: the two leaders at the G20 summit in 2024) No 10 said Sir Keir will visit India ¿at the earliest opportunity¿ following his phone call with Modi yesterday The agreement will see workers who are seconded to the UK offices of Indian-based employers, or a multi-national with offices in the country, exempt from NI for the first three years – allowing them to avoid paying both at home, as per Indian law, and in the UK. The firm will also not have to pay the contributions. The deal will be reciprocal for British workers transferred to workplaces in India.Officials have not provided an assessment of the cost or impact on UK businesses.The change is understood to have been a key demand by New Delhi’s negotiators who said the agreement, which has been three years in the making, will result in ‘significant financial gains’ for Indian companies.The deal will also see the UK lower tariffs on clothes, shoes and food such as frozen prawns from the subcontinent, in exchange for reciprocal cuts for products including whisky and cars.But the tax break – omitted from the UK press release on the pact – immediately provoked anger.Grim figures yesterday revealed the UK’s services sector had shrunk for the first time in 18 months, blamed on the NI increase – which came into force in April – and Donald Trump’s trade war.Tory business spokesman Harriett Baldwin told the Commons: ‘This Government is literally putting up taxes for British workers, but cutting them for Indian workers. This deal looks like it’s subsidising Indian labour while undercutting British workers.’And the party’s justice spokesman, Robert Jenrick, wrote on X: ‘British workers come last in Starmer’s Britain.’ The Prime Minister hosted a meeting of Indian investors and CEOs at 10 Downing Street in December Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch refused to agree to the deal when she was trade secretary over the NI issue and concerns about visas and fairness Robert Jenrick, wrote on X: ¿British workers come last in Starmer¿s Britain\\'\\nWriting in today’s Mail, Reform leader Nigel Farage, fresh from delivering Labour a bloody nose at last week’s local elections, said: ‘In Starmer’s Britain, people who have grown up here, worked hard, paid their taxes and propped up the economy are effectively being asked to pay to put themselves out of work. It is nothing short of a betrayal of working people in this country.’Defending the deal, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds pointed to equivalent agreements with the EU, the US and South Korea under the Double Contribution Convention.‘It means that when our people are moved by a company to India they will be paying into the UK system and not the Indian system, and when Indian people are temporarily in the UK they’ll be paying into their system and not to ours,’ he said. ‘But it’s very specific as to who this applies to.’But Tory MP Nick Timothy said ministers were ‘conning’ the public, adding: ‘These changes will create a massive incentive for UK firms to work with Indian service providers, undercutting domestic workers, companies and contractors.’ Reform leader Nigel Farage said: ¿In Starmer¿s Britain, people who have grown up here, worked hard, paid their taxes and propped up the economy are effectively being asked to pay to put themselves out of work\\' Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the deal \\'means that when our people are moved by a company to India they will be paying into the UK system and not the Indian system\\' Indian nationals accounted for the highest proportion of UK work visas issued last year.

But it will also set in train months of negotiations on a wide-ranging package of economic reforms and on the creation of some kind of youth experience scheme.Thomas-Symonds, who is heading ministerial “reset” efforts, previously insisted there were “no plans” for a youth mobility scheme, a key EU demand that would enable young adults from member states to study and work in the UK and vice versa. But on Tuesday he said that provided the UK government’s red lines were respected, “a smart, controlled youth mobility scheme would of course have benefits for our young people”.Ministers have indicated privately that they would cap numbers in any scheme and make it time limited, and Thomas-Symonds confirmed: “We will consider sensible EU proposals in this space.”He said Sir Keir Starmer, prime minister, had made it clear Britain would not return to free movement or rejoin the customs union or single market. The government was also committed to bringing down net migration, he added.But Thomas-Symonds said Britain already had youth mobility deals with countries including Australia and Uruguay, adding: “Nobody is suggesting any of those schemes, smart and controlled, are about freedom of movement.”Thomas-Symonds also suggested Britain would be prepared to allow EU fishermen to continue to enjoy current access to UK waters when a five-year agreement expires in 2026.He said it would have to be part of a wider deal to secure easier access for British fishermen selling their catch on the continent. “We are looking for an overall arrangement that is beneficial to our fishers,” he said.Thomas-Symonds left open the door to Britain continuing to align with EU rules in food standards and animal welfare, saying: “We are not interested in divergence for divergence sake or a race to the bottom on standards.”He also indicated Britain was prepared to accept a role for the European Court of Justice as part of a deal to cut red tape on cross-channel trade. “You would expect there to be an appropriate dispute resolution mechanism,” he said.Asked if he feared a backlash from Farage and Kemi Badenoch’s Conservatives, Thomas-Symonds said he looked forward to presenting the benefits of an accord to voters, who rejected Labour and the Tories in local elections in England last week. “I don’t worry about selling something that we believe would make the UK more secure and more prosperous,” he said. “This is a package for which we have a strong mandate from the British people. We need to move on from the debates of the past; this is forward-looking. It’s where the European continent is in the mid-2020s, not where it was in 2016.”Badenoch has already claimed that a youth mobility deal risks creating “another avenue which people might use to game the system”, while warning that Starmer was about to “sell out” British fishermen.After Reform’s gains last week, Thomas-Symonds’ comments are the prelude to a major political offensive by Starmer and other ministers to explain why closer EU ties will bring benefits to voters.Thomas-Symonds talked repeatedly about a “package” of reforms that he claimed would be popular with the public, from cutting red tape at borders in order to bring down food prices to making it easier for professionals or touring musicians to work on the continent.On a defence deal, he said: “At this moment in European history it’s not in the interests of the European continent to have fragmentation of our defence industrial capacity.”Asked whether Britain might at some point rejoin the Erasmus student exchange programme, Thomas-Symonds did not rule it out. “We don’t have plans to return to Erasmus,” he said. “But we are always open to listening to sensible proposals from the EU, but they have to be within the framework we’ve set out.” He said any closer ties to Europe had to be “part of a package which is in the national interest”.London has refused to cut university tuition fees for EU students to UK levels and any change to that policy would come with a considerable price tag. In the last seven-year Erasmus cycle, the UK contributed €2bn more than it received because more EU students used it than British ones.Additional reporting by Andy Bounds in Brussels\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

I think this Labour government has a lot to offer, whether it be the employment rights bill, the increase in the minimum wage, the massive investment in our NHS, but people have heard the winter fuel allowance and the welfare cuts overwhelmingly.”Meanwhile, the Red Wall Group of Labour MPs who represent seats in the Midlands and north of England being targeted by Reform UK, demanded the government U-turn on winter fuel payments.In a statement posted on X, they said: “The prime minister has shown strong leadership internationally which must now be matched at home.“Responding to the issues raised by our constituents, including on winter fuel, isn’t weak, it takes us to a position of strength.”\\n```\\n\\n## [Labour MPs signal rebellion over benefits cuts](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y4yrq013yo) (#51043)\\n\\n> 2025-05-07 22:01:14+00:00\\n\\n```\\nA number of Labour MPs have said they will vote against the government\\'s proposed cuts to disability benefits.Nine Labour MPs voiced concern over the government\\'s plans to make it harder for people with less severe conditions to claim disability payments during a debate on Wednesday. Calls to rethink the benefits cuts, as well as other policies, have been growing after Labour lost 187 council seats during the local election last week.Disability minister Sir Stephen Timms told the MPs the goal of the reforms was to make sure the welfare system was \"financially sustainable in the long term\".In March, the government announced a major welfare shake-up aimed at saving money and supporting people who can work to find jobs.Ministers said changes to a key disability benefit called personal independence payment (Pip) and universal credit (UC) would save around £5bn a year by the end of 2030 and get more people into work.Overall, the government spends £65bn a year on health and disability-related benefits. Before the government announced the Pip and UC changes, this was projected to increase to £100bn by 2029.The government estimated that 3.2 million families could be worse off as a result of the reforms, while 3.8 million families will be better off by 2030.The government is expected to pass a new law to make the welfare changes, giving MPs a chance to vote on the plans.Speaking during the debate in Westminster Hall, Diane Abbott, the Labour MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, said the government was \"making a conscious choice to balance its books on the backs of people on welfare\".Ian Byrne, who represents Liverpool West Derby, said he would \"swim through vomit to vote against\" proposed welfare changes.Labour MPs Richard Burgon, Rachael Maskell, Andy McDonald, Cat Eccles, Nadia Whittome, Imran Hussain, Steve Witherden and Ian Lavery also said they would vote against the government\\'s proposals.They were joined by John McDonnell, an independent MP for Hayes and Harlington who had the whip removed by Labour for rebelling against the government over the two-child benefit cap.A number of other Labour MPs have also indicated they are minded to oppose the benefits cuts in comments at events, in articles for local papers, as well as on social media.Disability minister Sir Stephen Timms defended the proposals, saying it was not sustainable for welfare spending to rise at the current rate.\"The current system produces poor employment outcomes, high economic inactivity, low living standards, high costs to the taxpayer. It needs to change,\" he said. \"We want a more proactive, pro-work system that supports people better and supports the economy as well.\"Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has come under increasing pressure to change course on some policy decisions.At Prime Minister Questions on Wednesday, Sir Keir defended the decision to axe winter fuel payments for millions of pensioners.It came after a group of about 45 Labour MPs representing seats in northern England and the Midlands joined those urging the government to rethink the move.The planned changes to disability benefits could become the next big political flashpoint, with legislation likely to be brought to the House of Commons in June.The BBC has been told some potential rebels are being assured they won\\'t lose the party whip if they abstain – or make themselves scarce – when the vote comes.The government is not at risk of defeat, given Labour has a large majority, but a sizable rebellion could show the extent of the discontent within the party.Senior minister Pat McFadden said \"we have to win the fight for Britain\\'s future\" while speaking at the Parliamentary Labour Party\\'s first gathering since the local elections, party sources said.The Cabinet Office minister criticised Reform UK, including the new mayor of Greater Lincolnshire, Dame Andrea Jenkyns, who said her party would \"reset Britain to its glorious past\" in her victory speech.McFadden said: \"Labour is always at its best when we look to the future. This is the fight of our lives, this is the generational fight in this new political era.\"I want to tell you we have to take on this new fight for the future - and we have to win.\"\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

While some advocate actively for AI learning tech, only a few can see the slow death of human intellect and critical thinking abilities in the hands of AI.\\nIn this article, we’ll unwrap the effects of artificial intelligence on human thinking and cognitive offloading. Sit tight because this could be a brain-melting one.\\nWhy Think When You Can Prompt?\\nLet’s start with a simple example of a college assignment.\\nBefore AI wasn’t more than just an odd combination of two English alphabets, you’d actually have to do the work yourself, read through tons of stuff, and then compile the whole assignment together. This required research, summarizing, understanding, analytical thinking, higher-level discernment, and even rephrasing.\\nCut to now, where you can just type in your assignment details on ChatGPT and let it churn out content while you sit back and scroll through Instagram or TikTok.\\nYou have a computer-generated, human-like assignment ready within a matter of minutes. The need to think, learn, and compile has gone for a toss, leaving no room for critical thought or understanding.\\nRemember the old adage, ‘the journey is what matters?’ Well, that journey has just been tossed out the window, learning and development opportunities included.\\nDuring our research for this article, we found ourselves genuinely wondering why students are resorting to such shortcuts. Well, one possible reason could be that education today is largely viewed as a set of tasks you need to complete to get a certificate. That’s about it.\\nThe ‘willingness’ to learn new things seems to be dying among new-age students. People are submitting LLM-generated assignments simply because they think the very act of writing up a project is not important or value-adding to their educational pursuit.\\nOh, and using GPT to complete your assignment is significantly easier than putting in the work yourself. That’s also a large part of it.\\nThe Changing Education Landscape\\nResearch at the University of Pennsylvania titled ‘Generative AI Can Harm Learning’ sheds more light on the matter. The experiment divided children in a Turkish high school into two categories: one with access to ChatGPT and another without.\\nStudents who used ChatGPT solved 48% more mathematical problems correctly during practice. However, when a test was conducted on the same topic, students without access to any LLM tool scored better. The children who had used ChatGPT while solving their practice problems scored 17% less.\\nWhat does this teach us? ChatGPT or any other LLM model only helps you ‘complete the task.’ However, it adds little value to your overall intellect and doesn’t contribute much to the learning spectrum. In other words, students who used ChatGPT simply copy-pasted the answers provided by the tool without understanding the process behind the solution.\\nSome argue that we already have technology like spreadsheets and calculators that automate such ‘mundane’ tasks. Why don’t we eliminate those and do stuff manually for the sake of ‘learning’?\\nWell, a key difference is that you still need to understand the formulas used on a spreadsheet to produce any usable output.\\nIt’s you who runs a spreadsheet with different formulas. A spreadsheet or a calculator does not alter the way we think; these tools still require us to use our intellect and our critical decision-making thought process.\\nHowever, AI tools are completely different.\\nInstead of helping us think, they end up thinking on our behalf. The very essence of being human is the ability to process information and ponder upon things from a critical point of view.\\nAt the risk of sounding overdramatic, AI could be the death of human thinking.\\nIncreasing Cognitive Offloading: Outsourcing Thinking\\nAnother study titled ‘AI Tools in Society: Impacts on Cognitive Offloading and the Future of Critical Thinking’ studied the correlation between cognitive offloading and the use of AI tools. Cognitive offloading is the practice of reducing mental work by offloading the task to external tools, which in this case are AI apps.\\nThe research shows that younger participants (17-25) exhibit the highest use of AI tools and also the lowest critical thinking scores. Cognitive offloading was also the highest among this age group. In contrast, older participants (46 and above) exhibited low AI tool usage and higher critical thinking scores.\\nAnd remember that the younger participants have started using AI tools only in the last couple of years. Unlike the present generation, they haven’t had access to these tools throughout their childhood or early adolescence. Even considering this relatively low exposure period, we are seeing low critical thinking and high cognitive offloading among this age group.\\nWe can extrapolate these results to the current batch of students who rely entirely on these AI tools for education. It’s reasonable to assume that if the same research is done five years down the line again, these students might get even lower critical thinking scores than the current batch.\\nThe same study shows a strong negative correlation between the use of AI tools and critical thinking.\\nThis means that the more people use these tools, the lower their critical thinking skills and scores are. Plus, there was a strong positive correlation between AI tool use and cognitive offloading. So, the more people use AI tools, the more they tend to throw away their ability to think critically.\\nAI Is Making Cheating the New Fad\\nEnter Cluely. It’s an advanced AI assistant with a tagline that reads, ‘Let’s Cheat on Everything.’ Unfortunately, that’s what it’s literally meant for – cheating the human intellect.\\nWhat’s more concerning is Cluely’s ad campaign, which shows two people on a date. The guy is wearing some sort of smart glasses, which tell him what to say next. It listens to responses from the girl and curates the ‘perfect reply.’\\nThe guy can be seen lying about his age, job, and preferences in the video. What’s more shocking is how blatantly the brand says, ‘We built Cluley so you never have to think alone again.’ Since when was this a good thing?\\nWhile this may sound fun to some people, it’s pretty bone-chilling to think where such tech might eventually take us. If the death of critical thinking and problem-solving wasn’t scary enough, there’s also the chance of AI killing our ability to have genuine human connections.\\nAlgorithmic LLMs like Cluely do not want to improve the human experience but rather replace it. Eventually, it’d just be two computer programs dating each other in human skin. Ana de Armas from Blade Runner 2049 is depressing, if you really think about it.\\nThe scarier part is that Cluely is not a backyard school project. It’s a real AI tool that has raised $5.3M in seed funding. People want tools like Cluely to make their lives easier, which does make sense. But should we really sacrifice human thinking at the altar of comfortable utility in the process?\\nAI: A Double-Edged Sword\\nNot everything is as grim as it looks.\\nAI and education have surely changed the way young minds learn. Earlier, we had to dig through several pages of a textbook to understand complex equations and theorems.\\nNow, human-like AI tools have been developed that gamify the whole learning experience and break down complex topics into small, actionable lessons.\\nSal Khan, the founder of Khan Academy, showed us the positive sides of AI in education two years back in a TED Talk when he unveiled Khanmigo, an AI learning assistant. Unlike LLMs that blurt out the answers to any question, Khanmigo gives students a hint about the math problem and encourages them to solve it themselves, still allowing them to think independently.\\nMost of our concern about AI in education is that students won’t learn how to write or think. Khanmigo solves this problem to an extent.\\nInstead of writing ‘for’ you, this AI assistant ‘writes with you.’ For example, if you want to write a story, it will direct you to write the first two lines, after which it will add another two lines and repeat the process until you have the full story. Khanmigo doesn’t kill creativity but rather stimulates it.\\nThis is a perfect example of how AI should be used in education. Rather than using it to offload our cognitive thinking, it should be used as a stimulus to human thought and the learning process as a whole.\\nThe bigger question is, whose responsibility is it to ensure learning stays a human experience? To put it bluntly, companies are not going to stop producing LLM tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude simply because they’re stifling human thinking. There’s money to be made, so goodbye moral responsibility.\\nTherefore, a large part of the responsibility falls on teachers, parents, and students themselves. Guardians should regulate the kind of AI tools a child has access to. At the same time, students should become more self-aware of the long-term harm caused by replacing their thought process with an AI prompt.\\nWhile tools like Khanmigo can become effective in the learning process, ‘feed me the answer’ kind of AI tools can kill human creativity and critical thinking.

Almost 70% of female students linked the use of AI recommendation algorithms used in social media to poor mental health, naming negative perceptions of body image and online bulling as some of the negative impacts social media algorithms can have.\\nWhile 29% of boys noted that AI can play a part in toxicity online, fewer of them linked this to a decline in mental wellness.\\nRead more on Diversity in IT\\nTech\\'s glaring gender gap and how to fix it\\nBy: Mary\\xa0Pratt\\nWomen face greater risk of job displacement from automation\\nBy: Clare\\xa0McDonald\\nNumber of girls taking A-level computing exceeds 3,000\\nBy: Clare\\xa0McDonald\\nNumber of girls taking A-level computing still fewer than 3,000\\nBy: Clare\\xa0McDonald\\n```\\n\\n## [UK critical systems at risk from ‘digital divide’ created by AI threats](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366623545/UK-critical-systems-at-risk-from-digital-divide-created-by-AI-threats) (#49533)\\n\\n> 2025-05-07 05:17:00+00:00\\n\\n```\\nDIgilife -

I can\\'t afford that within my current environment,\" he said.\\nLast week, the Trump administration proposed slashing NASA\\'s annual budget by 24 percent from $24.8 billion to $18.8 billion amid efforts to cut government spending.\\nMemgraph uses the same Cypher query language as Neo4j. However, it is written in C++ and integrates better with Python than Neo4j, which uses Java to build applications.\\n\"There were a lot of benefits. [We could] utilize the same tool without having to relearn a whole lot, because we\\'ve done a lot of work with Neo4j. And then [Memgraph] showed me the cost. That kind of sold me,\" he said. \"It was more about ease of transition as well as cost.\"\\nGraph database shows Biden outspends Trump in social media ad war\\nFather of SQL says yes to NoSQL\\nGraph databases speaking the same language after ISO gives GQL the nod\\nPharma boffins sharpen hunt for target molecules using graph DB\\nNASA is integrating Memgraph in its Human Capital Intelligent Query System to allow faster retrieval of relevant information for employees. \"Its graph-based approach allows us to keep track of real-time updates, ensuring accurate connections between various policy documents and data sources. By incorporating Memgraph into our Retrieval-Augmented Generation process, we enhance our system\\'s responsiveness and better address NASA\\'s knowledge extraction without requiring extensive manual data coordination,\" Meza said in a statement.\\nSpeaking to The Register, Memgraph CEO Dominik Tomicevic said Neo4j relied on complex b-tree structures on disk, with in-memory caching. \"So in order to run graph algorithms, one needs to have lots of really random jumps in the graph.\"\\nBecause disks are built for sequential reads, not random reads, the solution was to duplicate the data to run analytics workloads from a read-only format and then write back the results to the original data as needed.\\n\"While you can do a lot of stuff with Neo4j, especially if you\\'re doing some batch workloads, if you need to do decisions kind of in real time, then it becomes very expensive to rebuild those in-memory indexes and reduplicate all of the data and run the algorithms and then write the data back into the original graph,\" Tomicevic said.\\nIn Memgraph, the data structures are built for the data science workloads first, he claimed. With snapshots, the in-memory system can support transactional workloads as well as real-time analytics.\\nNeo4j was invited to comment for this article. ®\\n```\\n\\n## [Congress digs into China\\'s alleged theft of America\\'s AI secrets](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/may/7/congress-digs-chinas-alleged-theft-americas-ai-secrets/) (#54263)\\n\\n> 2025-05-07 20:31:26+00:00\\n\\n```\\nHouse lawmakers are worried that Chinese thieves are stealing America’s artificial intelligence secrets, boosting confidential info from the leading labs building top technology.\\nRep. Darrell Issa, California Republican, said Wednesday that China is refusing meaningful protections to safeguard U.S. intellectual property and is racing ahead in the contest for AI supremacy.\\n“We know China’s speed is not merely because they invest in innovation, it is also the result of IP theft, reverse engineering, efforts to circumvent U.S. export controls, and more,” Mr. Issa said at a House Judiciary Committee hearing. “China has also weaponized our legal system by financing lawsuits that target American firms in expensive litigation and with the intent, in many cases, to mine that proprietary information.”\\nMr. Issa cited the example of the Chinese firm DeepSeek, which is suspected of ripping off American AI firms.\\nIn April, the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party published the results of its investigation that said DeepSeek personnel infiltrated U.S. AI models and violated companies’ terms of service, among other things.\\nChina disputed the findings. Chinese embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu told Bloomberg in April the committee’s claims regarding China and DeepSeek were “groundless.”\\nBut the House Judiciary Committee is studying potential solutions to stop espionage and theft of crucial AI data, which includes such things as model weights, or the sought-after parameters of powerful AI models.\\nNicholas Andersen, a former Trump administration cyber official, told the committee on Wednesday it may be time to start treating AI infrastructure as critical infrastructure for cybersecurity purposes.\\nHe said technology such as AI companies and cloud computing providers were not considered critical infrastructure when policymakers last reviewed designations, but that ought to change.\\n“Doing so today would give us an opportunity to examine minimum cybersecurity requirements, would bring them into the fold for larger strategic planning, and latch them up with communities like DHS’ CISA…the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to be able to engage in information sharing operations,” he said. “These types of things, I think, would help to underpin greater security in these critical infrastructure industries.”\\nGeorgetown University Center for Security and Emerging Technology’s Helen Toner told lawmakers she recommended the government expand voluntary collaborations between AI companies and national security officials.\\n“There are some early efforts right now, they include threat intelligence sharing with the intelligence community,” Ms. Toner told the committee. “So they are working hand-in-hand in similar ways to how they do with critical infrastructure providers or our defense industrial base to ensure that when there are incoming threats, when we do have state-based actors trying to infiltrate our U.S. companies, they’re trying to find unclassified ways to ensure that the companies are aware and can prevent those threats and defend against them.”\\nLast year, the National Security Agency told The Washington Times its Cybersecurity Collaboration Center, which partners with cyber companies to guard against foreign hacks, was pursuing a new effort with select AI firms to fight new attacks.\\nAI companies’ security shortfalls have recently spilled into public view. Gladstone AI, a private firm that has worked closely with the U.S. government to investigate AI labs’ vulnerabilities, determined all frontier labs were “almost certainly” penetrated by the CCP after interviewing lab researchers and executives, as well as a slew of intelligence officers, hackers and others.\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

They all underestimated Labor. They all exaggerated One Nation and so on. All of them,” says Murray Goot, an emeritus professor of politics at Macquarie University.“And there are 10 of these polls. Roughly [taken] at the same time.”How the polls played outA simple average of the final polls had Labor’s two-party preferred at 52.3%, and primary vote at 31.6%. On the current count, these are smaller misses than in the 2019 election, when pollsters incorrectly showed Labor ahead.But all of the polls this election were wrong in the same direction.Polls underestimated Labor’s two-party preferred voteSeveral pollsters have told Guardian Australia the record number of votes for third parties and the record level of soft and undecided voters made their jobs more difficult – but say most were not too far off the mark in the end.“Essential, along with most polls, accurately picked up that the trend was moving towards Labor during the course of the campaign,” says Peter Lewis, the executive director of Essential, who runs Guardian Australia’s Essential poll.“Additionally our methodology of including undecideds means that with the final 4.8% that declared ‘unsure’ the week before the poll leaning Labor, the polling captured the momentum, if not the final ‘landslide’.”\\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email\\nThe RedBridge director, Kos Samaras, says there was “a lot of heavy backgrounding” that the public polls were wrong. RedBridge’s final poll had Labor at 53% to 47%, and it was showing Labor was doing well in key seats and in Queensland.“We were recording pretty big numbers for Labor and I thought maybe that was an aberration,” he says.“Clearly it was not.”The ‘herding’ effectThere should be some “noise” in polling, with estimates bouncing around. A month before election day, some on social media were already questioning if the polls were too stable. There were similar concerns by election watchers in 2019.Adrian Beaumont, an election analyst at the Conversation, suspects “herding”, when pollsters consciously or unconsciously adjust their results to match those published by their competitors, so they won’t be singled out if they are wrong.Guardian Australia is not accusing any of the pollsters of herding in this campaign.In the 2019 election, there was such a small spread among the polls that the Nobel prize-winning astrophysicist Brian Schmidt calculated the odds of it being chance at greater than 100,000 to one.Psychic croc\\'s election fail, Albanese heads straight for ice-cream, and ‘the other guy’ – video“The polls were afraid of showing a Labor victory by a landslide margin,” Beaumont says of the polls this year. “That’s why they were out – the polls understated Labor’s vote.“If you go back a couple of weeks, Roy Morgan had Labor winning 55.5% of the two-party vote. But then in the week before the election they came back down to 53%. They stayed at 53 in the final poll, which was published on the Friday before the election. If they hadn’t herded they may well have been the most accurate of pollsters.”In response to questions, Roy Morgan says there were “no changes in sampling and methodology” over the final weeks of the campaign, except to stop survey respondents nominating candidates who were not running in their electorates after the final candidate list was announced.“This is standard practice for pollsters during election campaigns,” Roy Morgan’s poll manager, Julian McCrann, says. “If there was any ‘herding’ it was towards us – we led the pack and picked up the swing to the ALP well before any other pollster.”McCrann also points out that several projections now show the final result will be about 54-46, “which is closer to a 53-47 result [final published Roy Morgan Poll] than a 55.5-44.5 result”.Method mixesGoot dismisses the idea there could have been a “late swing” towards the Labor party in the days after polls were collecting data. There were five polls conducted within a day or two before the election, he says, and they were no more accurate than earlier polls.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionFinal polls underestimated Labor“I can’t speak for other pollsters, but as far as Essential is concerned there is no herding by us,” Lewis says.“We ran double samples through the campaign but stuck to the methodology which we disclose through the Australian Polling Council.”There’s a lot of art to polling, including making assumptions about how preferences will flow, and the choice of how to “weight” survey samples so that they match the population at large.Throughout the campaign, some election analysts showed these methodological assumptions can have huge impacts, by recalculating published polls using preference flows from the last election rather than respondents’ stated preferences.“There was a fair discrepancy [among polls] depending on what you did,” Goot says.“In one case it was a difference of at least two percentage points between going with one [method] or another.”But there is no consensus on which method is more accurate.Sample sourcingGoot thinks herding was possible in this election – but “without transparency it’s difficult to know”. Either way, he says, the industry has more fundamental problems – such as whether survey samples cover everyone who should be included, and how pollsters handled “nonresponse” groups unable or unwilling to participate.Modern polling samples aren’t randomly drawn from the population. Rather, companies get access to “panels” of people from online databases. These databases are put together from a variety of sources, including loyalty programs, but we know very little about them.“What we suspect is they contain a very small percentage of all possible people that could be in it, and that should be in it,” Goot says.“[Pollsters] all say that they’ve got the best selection to draw on, but one possibility is that most of them go to the same source, and that doesn’t have all that many people in it. Some of the people answering the polls may be in more than one [poll].”Lewis says sourcing samples is a “challenge”, but that Essential’s outreach team “work hard to minimise the need for weighting”.McCrann says Roy Morgan interviews about 1,500 Australians each week. “And that is via multi-mode interviewing including online, telephone and face-to-face interviewing and we aren’t using the same databases of any rival pollster,” he says.How does weighting work?While polling companies request a spread of genders, ages and locations for their panels, not all respond, requiring them to proportionately scale up or down those that do – weighting.But weighting relies on the assumption that those who do and don’t respond to surveys are roughly similar. If this isn’t true, or the number of responses is very small, it can introduce other issues.“If, for example, the young people who respond are going to vote Green in reasonably large numbers, and the young people that don’t respond are going to vote Green in much smaller numbers, then if you weight you’re going to exaggerate the Green vote,” Goot says.Even after the 2019 election polling failure, there’s little transparency – but Goot believes there was a “good step” towards it with the polling council, formally established in 2020.Still, he notes, “not all the pollsters are members. And members don’t have to disclose very much.“They have to tell us what factors they weight by, but not how they do this. They have to put up their questions. They don’t tell us anything much about sampling, response rates or any of the other things that can go wrong with the sample.”\\n```\\n\\n## [Who is Sarah Witty? The Labor candidate set to dethrone Greens leader Adam Bandt in Melbourne](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/07/who-is-sarah-witty-labor-greens-leader-adam-bandt-melbourne-seat-federal-election-2025) (#53433)\\n\\n> 2025-05-07 06:34:07+00:00\\n\\n```\\nIn one of the biggest political upsets of the election, Labor’s Sarah Witty is projected to have defeated the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, in the seat of Melbourne.Bandt made history as the first Greens MP to be elected into the House of Representatives in 2010, when he won the inner-city seat off Labor and turned it into a stronghold for the minor party.Now that era looks to be at an end, with the ABC calling the seat for Witty – a result not even Labor insiders were expecting at the start of the campaign.So who is the woman behind the shock swing?Witty is a Richmond local of two decades, a foster carer and the chief of the Nappy Collective – a charity that distributes nappies to families experiencing disadvantage across Australia.Her path to politics is not typical. In a post on her Instagram account, she shared she had also run a ballet studio, owned a Subway franchise and worked as both a small business lender and insurer.In 2017, she began working with Homes for Homes – a social enterprise that raises funds for community housing by encouraging property owners to donate 0.1% of their sale price to charity. During her time there, Witty said she helped raise $110m in donations.\\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email\\nShe has said her experience as a foster carer has also shaped her worldview.Witty and her partner began fostering after 13 unsuccessful rounds of IVF, and receiving some advice from her mum.“At the time, I must admit it was hard to hear, but she said, ‘Maybe you need to be a mum for all children,’” Witty said in a video posted on social media.“I thought she was ridiculous, first of all, and then I thought, ‘Hang on a minute, maybe foster care might be the right place for me to be.’”Witty said she had lost count of how many children she’s fostered but the first child, a boy, “taught us how to be carers”. There was also another girl who came to them at four months and stayed until she was four, who remained in contact with them today.“She’s now seven, nearly eight, and she’s in our life and mum and dad keep her connected with us,” Witty said.Witty ran for Yarra city council in 2020 and 2024. Last year, she finished third with just over 20% of the vote in a tight three-way contest with the Greens and an independent.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotion“My absolute favourite place in Melbourne is Richmond. It is my home. It’s where I love to spend my time,” she said in another social media video.She said her favourite thing to do is walk the Yarra Trail, with the city in view, particularly at twilight.Her campaign for federal parliament was launched by Penny Wong, who is also in Labor’s left faction.Witty said she wanted to enter politics because she wanted to do more to address “disadvantage in the world”.“I’ve seen lots of disadvantage through my time in many different roles, and I really want to make sure that every person gets the best chance for the best life that they deserve,” she said.Witty is not the only female Labor candidate to knock out a Greens MP this election, with two Queensland women winning seats from the minor party in Brisbane’s inner north and south: Madonna Jarrett unseating Stephen Bates in Brisbane and Renee Coffey defeating Max Chandler-Mather in Griffith.Witty is also the second Labor candidate to defeat a party leader this election, after Ali France made history unseating the Liberal leader, Peter Dutton, in her third attempt at Dickson in Brisbane’s west.\\n```\\n\\n## [The Peter principle: how Dutton’s election campaign in Dickson went horribly wrong](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/08/the-peter-principle-how-duttons-election-campaign-in-dickson-went-horribly-wrong) (#53489)\\n\\n> 2025-05-07 15:00:48+00:00\\n\\n```\\nWhen Anthony Albanese visited Dickson on the first day of the election campaign, Labor strategists were still not expecting to mount a serious challenge in the Brisbane commuter belt seat, held by Peter Dutton for 24 years.“I think the logic was to start the campaign on the front foot, in enemy territory, rather than anyone thinking too much that we could win Dickson,” a Labor source says.Five weeks later on election night, Labor’s Ali France, a three-time challenger in Dickson, became the first person ever to unseat an opposition leader at a federal election.\\nGet our breaking news email, free app or daily news podcast\\nThe trigger for Labor to mount a final blitz in Dickson came from an unlikely source.On 31 March and 1 April, Climate 200 conducted a poll in Dickson in the hope of positive news about support for community independent candidate Ellie Smith.The UComms poll found the independent couldn’t win Dickson – her primary vote was about 10%. But the poll also showed Labor was in front in the seat, 51.7% to 48.3%.Guardian Australia understands that Climate 200 then showed the poll results to Labor – which had not commissioned any previous polling in Dickson, and was unaware the seat was so close – on 4 April. The party quickly conducted its own survey, which showed Dickson as a dead heat.Peter Dutton at a Salvation Army Red Shield event in Lawnton, Brisbane, in the seat of Dickson. Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAPOn 9 April, Labor’s campaign director, Paul Erickson, sent an email to supporters headed: “We’re taking on Dutton in Dickson”.“I just greenlit an additional $130,000 for Labor’s campaign in Peter Dutton’s seat of Dickson,” Erickson wrote.“Overnight, our campaign conducted new research in Dickson. It turns out Peter Dutton’s seat is closer than we originally thought. I’m sending this email to Labor’s top supporters, because as you read this, we’re working to adjust our budget in response to these findings.”The Coalition told the Courier-Mail at the time that its own polling, conducted by Freshwater Research, had Dutton comfortably in front; Dutton himself dismissed the push as a “propaganda campaign”.“The people of Dickson aren’t stupid,” he said. “The polling I’ve seen puts us in a comfortable position, I’m happy with that. You wouldn’t believe it but Labor put out a fundraising email which started this propaganda campaign. I wouldn’t fall for that.”News Corp reported this week that Coalition insiders withheld polling results from Dutton, including in Dickson. Some Liberal National party insiders dispute that the party would have conducted any significant polling in Dickson. One said: “We tried to win the election, not save the furniture”.Even as results showed big swings away from the Coalition, party faithful were still shocked to see Dutton’s seat go on election night.A ‘huge grassroots campaign’After all, Dutton had been written off in Dickson before. He wasn’t supposed to enter parliament in 2001, but defeated a shadow cabinet minister, Cheryl Kernot, in a seat that had changed hands a few times since it was first contested in 1993. As Dutton said on election night, Dickson had a “one-term curse” before he ran.Heading towards the 2010 election, Dutton held a slim margin and the polls pointed to another big Labor win. He attempted to switch to a safe seat on the Gold Coast, before the electoral tide turned and Dutton increased his margin.And he faced “the fight of his political life” in 2019 when activist group GetUp! poured millions into a ground campaign to oust him. Dutton again defied the push and held on. Labor strategists believe the GetUp! campaign, and the perception it was being funded and run from outside the electorate, probably did more harm than good.“In a state like Queensland, if people perceive that groups from other states have come to tell them what to do or how to live they will react very badly to that,” former Rudd government minster Craig Emerson told Guardian Australia at the time.The newly elected member for Dickson, Ali France of Labor, with Grace Grace, of the Queensland Labor party, at the Labor Day rally in Brisbane on Monday. Photograph: Jono Searle/AAP“That’s not an attack on GetUp, maybe 100% of their volunteers who were on the booths campaigning were Queenslanders, but if there is a perception they were outsiders, Queensland is such a parochial state that it would go down very badly.”This time round Ellie Smith, who won 12.6% of the vote, says her campaign was a grassroots one. Climate 200 gave her $319,590 starting in September, but Smith says most of the money she raised was from locals and local donations.By midway through the campaign, the Coalition appeared spooked by the independent, and began attacking Smith on local billboards.“We started with about 20 friends around a table and it grew very very quickly, the momentum was really there for change in Dickson, people were really motivated and they’d never done anything like it before,” Smith said.“We really set out to win and I think that motivated people [but] we weren’t unhappy with the result.“They saw our campaign as a major threat towards the end of the election. [The Coalition] would have spent 300k in the last three weeks attacking me personally. It really didn’t stick, it was very clear we’d done the work so people understood what I stood for as a community independent.”Dutton’s primary vote of 34.9% – down 7 percentage points – is the lowest in his two decades contesting the seat. When he won narrowly in 2007 – by about 200 votes – the Coalition primary vote was 46%. Part of the story in Dickson is that Smith ate into Dutton’s support, and that her preferences mostly flowed back to Labor.France, who had been widely tipped to beat Dutton in 2019, contested Dickson again in 2022 and brought the margin back to a tight 1.7%.France said on election day that “seven years of work” had helped her forge relationships with people in the area.“I’ve knocked on so many doors, I’ve had so many conversations. I feel like people really know who I am and what I stand for now,” she said.“[Dutton] is a massive spender on his campaign, particularly advertising. We have never been able to compete with that. But what our campaign has always been about is a huge grassroots game. It’s about door-knocking, it’s about the high visibility. It’s about being at markets.”Anthony Albanese visits a campaign office in the seat of Dickson in the suburb of Strathpine. Photograph: Asanka Ratnayake/Getty ImagesLabor sources reject any suggestion that Smith’s campaign radically changed the outcome, pointing to the fact France increased her primary vote, in addition to Smith winning a large chunk of the anti-Dutton vote.The end of a potential PMPaul Williams, an associate professor of politics and journalism at Griffith University, said Dutton’s profile as opposition leader had been “much higher” at this election than ever before. That might have hindered, rather than helped, in Dickson.“There’s no doubt that the overarching factor [for the whole election campaign] was Peter Dutton and his personality and personal style,” Williams said.Like many others, Williams had predicted Dutton would lose Dickson at past elections, only for him to hold on. He said the electorate was part of a bigger story – Queensland seats like Petrie and Forde, both won by Labor unexpectedly, had similar demographics.“These places have a higher proportion of tradies, small businesses, blue collar workers [and they’re] defying electoral gravity.“[People] were hurt by the cost-of-living crisis and yet they’ve rewarded Albo and kicked the opposition in the groin.“One view is that people liked Peter Dutton as a local member, maybe as a minister, but they didn’t want him as a potential prime minister.“[Dutton] is a difficult politician to warm to as a leader. And of course he’s come into focus much more [as opposition leader]. Local voters might not have paid much attention to who their MP was, but after 2022 [Dutton] becomes a figure of national focus and Labor was certainly saying that the more people see of Peter Dutton, the less they like him.”\\n```\\n\\n## [The lack of Liberal women isn’t just a political liability – it’s a structural failure. Of course we should consider quotas](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/07/the-lack-of-liberal-women-isnt-just-a-political-liability-its-a-structural-failure-of-course-we-should-consider-quotas) (#53667)\\n\\n> 2025-05-07 06:03:33+00:00\\n\\n```\\nThe result of the federal election was shocking but it wasn’t surprising.It was a resounding message from voters – and we would be foolish not to listen.The truth is, the Liberal party didn’t lose because of campaign tactics or some leadership missteps alone. We lost because our policies failed to resonate. And they failed to resonate because, too often, they were built without the input of the very Australians we needed to win over – women, young people, multicultural communities and urban voters.Too many of our policies seemed disconnected from the daily realities of modern Australia. The cost of living, housing, secure jobs, climate and education are dominating the concerns of millions – yet when asked how we’d address them we gave voters little reason to believe we understood the scale of the problem, let alone have credible answers.To chart a credible path forward, we must return to first principles. The Liberal party was once defined by its broad reach – a party of the “forgotten people”, where aspiration met compassion and economic freedom was balanced by social responsibility. That legacy, championed by the party founder Robert Menzies, meant putting the concerns of ordinary Australians at the centre of political life.We have drifted far from that foundation. Too many Australians now see us as departed from the centre, and speaking to a narrowing segment of the population, not to them.The lack of women in our ranks is not just a political liability – it’s a structural failure. Women make up more than half the population yet remain dramatically underrepresented in our party, from branch level to the parliament itself. Of course we should be considering quotas. This is not about ticking boxes – it’s about removing entrenched barriers and making space for talent we have long overlooked. A necessary circuit breaker at a veritable crisis point where organic growth hasn’t materialised.Quotas are not foreign to the Liberal party. We already use them. Every party branch and conference must elect both a male and a female delegate to vote in Senate and upper house preselections. We have quotas for metropolitan and regional members of our state executive. We have quotas for male and female vice-presidents.The Coalition itself operates as a quota-based model: ministerial and shadow ministerial positions are shared between the Liberals and Nationals according to negotiated agreements. The leader of the Liberal party is our prime minister in government and the leader of the National party is our deputy prime minister – a power-sharing arrangement by design.But improving representation isn’t just about numbers. It’s about culture. Women should feel that they belong in the Liberal party – not as a gesture or a fix, but because their perspectives are essential to how we govern. If women don’t feel heard, valued or safe in our ranks they won’t stay – and voters will continue to turn away from us, too.The same is true for young Australians, multicultural Australians, and city dwellers. Too often they were dismissed as too hard to reach, when in fact, the message itself was the problem.Their concerns are real. They want secure work, a shot at buying a home, meaningful climate action and a system that doesn’t leave them behind. These challenges can be solved through true adherence to Liberal values. But they won’t be solved if we vacate the field.That is a recipe for disaster, where we offer no reason for frustrated Liberals to return; direct swing voters away and close the door to potential future cohorts of supporters.This election loss was not some kind of anomaly. It was a clear judgment on our relevance and resonance with the electorate. It’s not just that we didn’t win – it’s that voters didn’t see themselves reflected in our policies, our people or our priorities.Rebuilding starts with humility. It starts with broadening our base, modernising our policy agenda, and cultivating a culture that welcomes and elevates a wider range of voices. We don’t need to become a different party. We need to become a better version of the party we were meant to be.Australians are asking for leadership that is competent, compassionate and connected to their lives. If we are serious about governing again we must rebuild trust – not with slogans or short-term campaign commitments, but with substance.That work must begin now.\\nMaria Kovacic is a Liberal senator for New South Wales\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

The City Council in Salt Lake City approved three new flags: one with the rainbow colors of the Pride flag, a second with the pink and blue of the transgender Pride flag and a third with a symbol and date referring to the Juneteenth holiday that commemorates the end of slavery. Each flag also includes the sego lily, a city symbol and Utah’s state flower.ImageNew city flags were adopted by Salt Lake City in response to a recent state law.Credit...Salt Lake City Mayor\\'s OfficeIn Boise, the City Council designated the rainbow Pride flag and a flag promoting organ donation as official city flags.“The City of Boise will continue to fly the flags on City Hall Plaza that represent our community and speak to our values of caring for people and welcoming all,” Lauren McLean, Boise’s mayor, said in a statement before the resolution was adopted.The Utah legislature passed a law in March banning the display of flags that are not explicitly approved at public schools and government buildings. (Flags allowed under the state law include the American flag, the state flag, city flags, flags of other countries or states, and college and military flags.)Gov. Spencer Cox of Utah, a Republican, allowed the measure to become law without his signature, saying that he was concerned it was too sweeping but that he recognized a veto would be overridden. The law did not explicitly mention L.G.B.T.Q. or Pride flags, but sponsors of the bill indicated that barring such flags was a major part of their motivation.Earlier this year, Idaho also banned displaying unofficial flags at government buildings.ImageMayor Erin Mendenhall of Salt Lake City supported the city’s new flags.Credit...Niki Chan Wylie for The New York TimesMayor Erin Mendenhall of Salt Lake City, a Democrat, said in a statement that the new flags promoted unity. “I want all Salt Lakers to look up at these flags and be reminded that we value diversity, equity and inclusion,” she said, “leaving no doubt that we are united as a city and people, moving forward together.”In response to Salt Lake City’s action on Tuesday, the Utah House speaker, Mike Schultz, a Republican, said in a statement to The Salt Lake Tribune: “Salt Lake City’s move to bypass state law is a clear waste of time and taxpayer resources.”He added: “Salt Lake City should focus on real issues, not political theatrics.”A state senator, Daniel McCay, mocked the city’s action by posting photos on social media of flags that, along with Salt Lake City’s sego lily, displayed a symbol of the Mormon Church, the design of the flag of Israel and President Trump’s “MAGA” slogan.A similar state bill in Florida that would have barred flags expressing a “political viewpoint” failed to advance at the recently concluded legislative session.Victor Mather, who has been a reporter and editor at The Times for 25 years, covers sports and breaking news.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\\n```\\n\\n## [Salt Lake City and Boise adopt official pride flags to skirt Republican bans](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/07/salt-lake-city-boise-pride-flags) (#47746)\\n\\n> 2025-05-08 00:43:35+00:00\\n\\n```\\nEarlier this year, Utah and Idaho’s Republican-controlled legislatures passed bans on flying the rainbow pride flags and other “unofficial flags” on government property.Leaders in both states’ capital cities, Salt Lake City and Boise, recently devised an inventive workaround – changing their official flags.Salt Lake City’s mayor, Erin Mendenhall, proposed the adoption of three new city flags, which were unanimously approved by the city council. All three have the city’s traditional sego lily design, respectively imposed over a pride flag, a trans flag and a Juneteenth commemoration flag.“Our city flags are powerful symbols representing Salt Lake City’s values,” said Mendenhall in a press release. “I want all Salt Lakers to look up at these flags and be reminded that we value diversity, equity and inclusion – leaving no doubt that we are united as a city and people, moving forward together.”The new flags were a direct reaction to Utah’s House Bill 77, which narrowed the list of allowable flags to the state flag, the US flag, Olympic and Paralympic flags, official college flags or tribal flags, a city or county flag and military flags. State and local governments could be fined $500 a day for flying other unofficial flags.The newly adopted city flags are displayed at the Salt Lake city and county building. Photograph: Melissa Majchrzak/APIdaho’s House Bill 96 restricted flags to a list including the US flag, the POW/MIA flag, the official flags of Idaho colleges, universities and public schools, the official flags of military branches and the Idaho state flag. The pride flag has flown over Boise’s city hall for years. Boise mayor Lauren McLean issued a proclamation in response, retroactively making the pride flag an official city flag.Rolling back LGBTQ+ rights has been a fixation for the Trump administration, and for conservative legislatures across the country. The US supreme court recently upheld Trump’s ban on trans military members. The president has penned executive orders targeting trans athletes and imposing strict gender definitions.Wyoming, one of the US’s reddest states, had more trans-focused bills than trans athletes this year. Iowa pushed to remove gender identity from the state’s civil rights code. More than a dozen other states are considering flag measures similar to those in Utah and Idaho.Boise’s city council voted 5-1 in favor of the proclamation, with council member Meredith Stead as an affirmative vote.“Removing the flag now after years of flying it proudly would not be a neutral act,” said Stead. “It would signal a retreat from values we’ve long upheld and send a disheartening message to those who have found affirmation and belonging through its presence at city hall.”\\n```\\n\\n## [Hours Before Pride Flag Ban Begins, Dem Mayor of Salt Lake City Adopts It Among New City Flags](https://redstate.com/beckynoble/2025/05/07/hours-before-pride-flag-ban-begins-dem-mayor-of-salt-lake-city-adopts-it-and-others-as-new-city-flags-n2188804) (#51703)\\n\\n> 2025-05-07 21:45:00+00:00\\n\\n```\\nAmong the many reasons Donald Trump was reelected was that Americans were sick and tired of leftist agendas being pushed down their throats. But as President Trump attempts to stop goofy liberal ideas from being forced on Americans, there are plenty of blue cities in red states that view themselves as the \"resistance\" to the Trump agenda. One such place is Salt Lake City, Utah. You would think that with serious issues like the economy and crime that most large cities currently deal with, they wouldn\\'t have time for things like city flags or banners. Think again.\\nUtah and Idaho passed state laws that bar the flying of unofficial flags on schools and government buildings.So Salt Lake City and Boise just approved new pride flags to get around the ban.Capitol cities going against the will of their states is BS.Full article in reply. pic.twitter.com/g99ZvZrO9j— Brick Suit (@Brick_Suit) May 7, 2025Salt Lake City Democrat Mayor Erin Mendenhall had one such serious issue on her plate at Tuesday night\\'s City Council meeting, while presenting a city budget proposal. But Her Honor also had one other meeting agenda item. Hours before a state ban on Pride flags took effect, the Council also added one more item, a discussion to allow new city banners. The result: three new city banners were adopted--the Pride flag, the transgender flag, and a Juneteenth flag, all of which also display the white sego lily that appears on the current city flag. By making them all official city flags, the city could bypass the state ban. The city has a majority of members on the City Council who are LGBTQ. As you might guess, it was a unanimous vote to adopt the flags as official city flags.\\xa0READ MORE: Utah Becomes First State to Ban Rainbow Flags in Schools, Government Buildings—Will Others Follow?Mendenhall said of the new city flags,\\n“As mayor, I have a duty to lawfully uphold the values of our nation, state and our city. I know that the values of diversity, equity and inclusion are not only right and just, but they are fundamental to America, even through all its struggles to uphold them.”Earlier in 2025, the Utah Legislature passed HB77,\\xa0which restricts the kinds of flags that can be flown in front of schools and government buildings. The list of flags permitted includes the American flag, state and military flags, the Olympic flag, college or university flags, and local city flags. Gov. Spencer Cox (R) did not sign the bill; therefore, banning Pride and other flags like it from being flown in front of public buildings, which goes into effect Wednesday.\\xa0Republican members of the State Legislature voiced their opposition to the new flags. House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, called it “a clear waste of time and taxpayer resources.” He added, “This law is about keeping government spaces neutral and welcoming to all. Salt Lake City should focus on real issues, not political theatrics.\" Utah Senate President Stuart Adams said:“It’s disappointing that Salt Lake City is diverting time and resources away from real pressing community needs in an attempt to bypass state law. The intent of this bill is to help ensure that government buildings remain neutral, focused on serving the public and welcoming to all.”\\nIn a move possibly to send a message to the Mayor and City Council that everyone can play the game, State Sen. Dan McKay, R-Riverton, who sponsored HB77, created a collection of flags of his own. One had a symbol of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, an Israeli flag, and one that said, \"MAGA Country.\"\\xa0He posted on X, “Proud of Erin for being so inclusive with the new 365.25 flag initiative.\" State Rep.

Ministerial code requires ministers to ensure “that no conflict arises, or could reasonably be perceived to arise” from their public duties and private interests.The regulator, which is being established via a bill currently going through parliament, was recommended by former Conservative sports minister Tracey Crouch. It will supervise English men’s professional football clubs.That recommendation followed the collapse of Bury in 2019 and the failed attempt two years later by six English top-flight clubs to create a breakaway European Super League.Kogan said the regulator should be seen as an “asset” to the game and not a “cop”. It would have “quite a lot of teeth” despite being designed to be “light touch” with a “relatively lightweight bureaucracy”, he added.David Kogan speaking at the House of Commons culture, media and sport committee © House of Commons“I want the regulator to have a help desk and have a way whereby we’re not seen as being a cop in the world of football, we’re seen as being an asset to the world of football,” he told the House of Commons culture, media and sport committee.His remarks come against a backdrop of concerns, particularly at the Premier League, that the body could deter investment in one of Britain’s greatest cultural exports and undermine the division’s competitiveness.Kogan, who has negotiated media rights deals on behalf of the major football competition organisers in England, said that if clubs lacked the accounting practices to answer questions about their financing and liquidity, the body would supply it.“If you do not have an understanding of what we’re trying to do, we will send a team to you,” he added.Kogan said that he looked forward to speaking with football chiefs about resolving the differences between the Premier League and the English Football League, which runs the Championship, League One and League Two, over how money is shared by the top flight with the rest of the football pyramid.The regulator will have “backstop” powers that enable it to intervene in the negotiations, which have dragged on for years. But Kogan, a fan of Tottenham Hotspur, urged football bosses to “agree among themselves” and “not to invoke” the backstop.“The less you hear of the regulator, the better,” he said.\\n```\\n\\n## [New football regulator boss did not APPLY for the top job, select committee interview reveals - amid...](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-14688535/New-football-regulator-boss-did-not-APPLY-select-committee-reveals-links-Keir-Starmers-leadership-campaign.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490) (#52919)\\n\\n> 2025-05-07 19:32:54+00:00\\n\\n```\\nNew football regulator boss did not APPLY for the top job, select committee interview reveals - amid chairman in waiting\\'s links to Keir Starmer\\'s leadership campaign\\n18:28, 07 May 2025, updated\\n20:32, 07 May 2025\\nBy\\nMIKE KEEGAN\\nDavid Kogan, 67, has landed one of the most important positions in UK sport\\xa0Kogan previously worked as chief media rights adviser to the Premier League\\xa0LISTEN NOW: It\\'s All Kicking Off! Arsenal need to sign players for the here and now to win the Premier League... so, should they sign Harry Kane?\\nThe chairman of the new independent football regulator donated to Sir Keir Starmer’s leadership campaign and did not apply for the job.\\xa0David Kogan, who has landed one of the most important positions in sport, told MPs he was approached by government and urged to put his name forward.\\xa0The 67-year-old, former chief media rights adviser to the Premier League, was known to have been a Labour donor who had written two books on the history of the party.\\xa0However, his direct backing of the prime minister and fellow 2020 leadership contender Lisa Nandy were, until Wednesday, unknown publicly.\\xa0Added to the above, the further revelation that he was effectively headhunted will further raise questioning over what is becoming an increasingly controversial appointment.\\xa0The Conservative Party have called for an urgent investigation, while Labour have previously responded to accusations of cronyism regarding Kogan\\'s selection by pointing out he was also asked about chairing the regulator by the previous Conservative Government.\\xa0 David Kogan has revealed that he did not apply for his new role as chairman of the independent football regulator The 67-year-old received a grilling from MPs on the culture, media, and sport select committee Kogan also admitted that he had contributed to the leadership campaigns of Lisa Nandy and Keir Starmer ‘Five years ago I contributed very small sums of money to both the leadership campaigns for Keir Starmer and Lisa Nandy, I am happy to declare that now,’ Kogan told the culture, media and sport select committee in a 90-minute grilling.\\xa0When asked to outline the recruitment process for the £130,000-a-year, part-time role Kogan responded: ‘I didn’t apply. On May 16 last year, the day applications closed, I received a call from the permanent secretary of the department asking me why I hadn’t applied.’\\xa0He then claimed he was told that other candidates had suggested he was a better fit for the role.\\xa0Dame Caroline Dinenage, the Conservative chairwoman of the committee, branded Kogan ‘effectively Labour Party aristocracy’, and added that a ‘perceived bias is not unreasonable’.\\xa0‘What are you going to do to address it so that from day one you are getting rid of these allegations that you are in the pocket of the prime minister, in cahoots with the culture secretary and a puppet of the Labour government?’ she asked.\\xa0Kogan acknowledged the situation needed to be addressed and added that he had not met Starmer since he became Prime Minister.\\xa0‘I recognise there is a perception of bias and the way you correct that is by action and delivery,’ he said. ‘I have to give you my personal assurance this will not happen. I am very happy to be held to account.’\\xa0Louie French, the Conservative shadow sports minister, called for an investigation, claiming that the failure to disclose the donations publicly was ‘a clear breach of the governance code on public appointments’.\\xa0 One of the key roles of the regulator could be to force a deal between the Premier League and the EFL on financial redistribution French added that the matter represented ‘a serious breach of public trust’.\\xa0The regulator will operate a licensing system for the 116 clubs in the top five tiers of English football with a principal remit to ensure clubs are run sustainably and are accountable to their fans.\\xa0Crucially, it will also have the power to force a deal between the Premier League and EFL on financial redistribution. Parachute payments will also fall under its remit.\\xa0 The EFL declined to comment on the appointment. The Premier League have been contacted for comment.A Premier League spokesperson said: ‘We will work constructively with the Chair once they have been formally appointed.’\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

The team have agreed a trade to send the talented but mercurial 24-year-old to Dallas.According to ESPN, the deal, which the Cowboys confirmed on Wednesday morning, will send Pickens and a 2027 sixth-round pick to Dallas. In return, the Steelers will get a 2026 third-round pick and a 2027 fifth-round pick.Pickens is about to enter the final year of the rookie deal he signed in 2022 when the Steelers took the former Georgia star in the second round. The 6ft 3in, 200lb Pickens has spent his first three seasons in the NFL being equal parts productive and petulant, mixing highlight-reel catches with bouts of immaturity along the way.The Steelers, particularly head coach Mike Tomlin, frequently backed Pickens as he endured what the team frequently described as a version of growing pains while he adjusted to life in the NFL.Pickens has been one of the most dynamic receivers in the league when he’s on the field and engaged, which is not always a given. Pickens led the league by averaging 18.1 yards per catch in 2023 and has 174 receptions for 2,841 yards and 12 scores in 48 games.But he’s also consistently struggled to keep his emotions in check. Last season alone he twice ended games by getting into dust-ups with opposing defensive backs, first when he grabbed Dallas’ Jourdan Lewis by the facemask and then when he tussled with Cleveland’s Greg Newsome II rather than try to get in position for a last-second Hail Mary.He was also fined for using an expletive on his eye black against the Cowboys, a rule he said he was unaware of at the time. Pickens also drew widespread criticism in 2023 for what could generously be described as inattentive downfield blocking for his teammates.Considering his volatility, the Steelers didn’t seem interested in signing Pickens to a contract extension and he became expendable when they traded for two-time Pro Bowler DK Metcalf in March, whom they promptly signed to a five-year contract.Pickens is joining a Cowboys offense that could use another downfield threat to pair with star CeeDee Lamb. Dallas’ second-leading pass catcher behind Lamb last year was tight end Jake Ferguson, with Jalen Tolbert’s modest 49 receptions a distant third.\\n```\\n\\n## [Cowboys sacrifice player to sign George Pickens after huge trade](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nfl/article-14688927/Cowboys-sacrifice-player-George-Pickens-trade-Seth-Williams.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490) (#52986)\\n\\n> 2025-05-07 20:17:29+00:00\\n\\n```\\n20:56, 07 May 2025, updated\\n21:17, 07 May 2025\\nBy\\nERIC BLUM\\nREAD MORE:\\xa0Jacksonville Jaguars release Gabe Davis after just one season\\nThe Cowboys have released wide receiver Seth Williams to make room for newly acquired wideout George Pickens, who they brought to Dallas earlier on Wednesday.\\xa0Pickens was traded to Dallas from the\\xa0Pittsburgh Steelers on Wednesday morning alongside a sixth-round pick in next year\\'s draft.

And the world will have to be patient for at least a few more hours, as the cardinals in the conclave break for lunch and convene again for the next secret ballot.On Thursday morning, crowds gathered in St. Peter’s Square as the 133 cardinals voted in total secrecy. The black smoke prompted gasps and then groans from the crowds in St. Peter’s Square as they understood that no candidate had captured two-thirds of the cardinal electorate during voting in the morning. Pope Francis’ death in April set in motion the process of choosing his successor, the first conclave in more than a decade. The papal election is one of the world’s oldest dramas, but this one is unlike any other. It is the largest ever assembled, and many cardinals appointed by Francis are meeting one another for the first time.The new faces bring unfamiliar politics, priorities and concerns that some experts say could make the selection process more fragmented than usual. Francis also left the church deeply divided, with progressive factions pushing for more inclusion and change, and conservatives seeking to roll things back, often under the guise of preserving unity.Here’s what to know:How it works: Except for Wednesday, when there was only one vote, the cardinals will participate in four rounds of voting every day until a candidate achieves a two-thirds majority. The ballots are burned up to twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon, and smoke emitted from a purpose-built chimney above the Sistine Chapel signals the result — black smoke for no decision, white if there is a pope.How long it takes: There is no indication of how long the conclave will go, though the last two conclaves reached decisions within two days. One in the 13th century dragged on for almost three years.Extreme secrecy: Some security experts say the conclave is the most secure vote anywhere. The closed-door process, which is designed to be leakproof, has been fine-tuned over the centuries.Referendum on Francis: The election in many ways will turn on whether the cardinals want a pope who will follow Francis’ path of openness and inclusion or forge a different one. During his 12-year pontificate, Francis made landmark declarations that encouraged liberals, including allowing the blessing of people in same-sex unions and raising his voice for migrants.Here are 7 key issues dividing the Roman Catholic Church.ImageCardinals in Vatican City after the death of Pope Francis. A conclave to choose his successor is to start on Wednesday.Credit...James Hill for The New York TimesThe cardinals who are electing the next pope sometimes look as ideologically polarized as many secular voters around the globe. Many conservative Roman Catholic Church leaders disagreed with Pope Francis, who was often a darling of liberals around the world.But the typical divisions between progressives and conservatives don’t correspond so neatly with the ideological battles within the Vatican and the broader church. Complex debates are ongoing over the role of women and L.G.B.T.Q. Catholics in the church, whether priests should be able to marry, accountability for sexual abuse by priests and other divisive questions.More than any single issue, the choice of the next pontiff will be dominated by a philosophical question: Who deserves a say in determining the church’s future?AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTCardinals are supposed to pick up the voting this afternoon. They are set to have two more rounds of voting today, unless they elect a pope on the first. Interest in the ‘Conclave’ movie has soared. How accurate is it?ImageA scene from “Conclave,” a fictionalized account of the selection of a new pope.Credit...Focus Features, via Associated PressThe death of Pope Francis last month drove a surge of interest in the 2024 movie “Conclave,” a fictionalized account of the selection of a new pope.Streaming views rose 3,200 percent week-over-week, according to the tracking firm Luminate. When Amazon Prime Video made the film available at no extra cost to subscribers the day after the pope’s death, the number of minutes watched jumped to 18.3 million, from 574,000 a week earlier.The movie was “quite accurate, save for a few things,” said Kurt Martens, a professor of canon law at the Catholic University of America.ImageA scene from “Conclave.”Credit...Focus Features, via Associated PressBut, of course, not all the details of the process have leaked. “On some level, very few people outside the College of Cardinals can really speak to the reality” of what takes place, said Piotr H. Kosicki, an associate professor of history at the University of Maryland who focuses on Roman Catholicism.Here’s what happens in the film, and what papal experts say is accurate about its depiction of Vatican rituals.What’s ‘Conclave’ about?The film opens with the death of an unnamed fictional pope and follows the process and drama of a papal election.It stars Ralph Fiennes as Cardinal Thomas Lawrence, the dean of the College of Cardinals, with Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow, Lucian Msamati and Sergio Castellitto playing top papal contenders.The film follows the cardinals through several voting sessions, meals in a shared cafeteria and the rooms in the papal palace where they are sequestered.The emphasis on secrets and remaining insulated — the world conclave comes from the Latin for “with key” — has no doubt contributed to the interest in “Conclave,” which experts say does a reasonably good job of capturing this special moment in the workings of the Vatican.How much of the voting is shown?Many of the rituals in the film — the prayers being said, the burning of the ballots, a needle being woven through the ballots — are “more or less correct,” Dr. Kosicki said.During the voting process, each cardinal writes the name of one person on a rectangular ballot. Votes are announced aloud one by one, and each ballot is threaded with a single needle before being burned. Four rounds of voting are permitted daily.Some rituals depicted in the film take place in a mix of English and Spanish. In reality, Dr. Kosicki said, “prayer in the Vatican is in Italian or in Latin, period.”Is there as much cutthroat politicking in real life?While it is impossible to say exactly what goes on within the confines of the conclave, electing a pope is similar to electing a head of state, said Massimo Faggioli, a professor of history at Villanova University who specializes in the administrative inner workings of the Catholic Church and of the papacy.The politicking begins in earnest after the pope has died during what is called sede vacante, the period when the seat is vacant. But unlike in a standard governmental election, overt campaigning is taboo, Vatican experts say.Is it common for the cardinals to go multiple rounds without reaching a decision?The conclave process was created in the early Middle Ages to ensure that a new pope could be chosen quickly. The film “Conclave” depicts a pope being chosen over three days and seven ballots. In the last couple of centuries, conclaves haven’t lasted more than four days, Dr. Faggioli said. Pope Benedict XVI was elected in two days in 2005, as was Pope Francis in 2013.“Everyone likes it when things go fast because it means a show of unity,” Dr. Kosicki said. “And it means a strong sort of message being sent to the outside world, to the 1.4 billion Catholics.”After black smoke at noon, the crowd in St. Peter’s hopes for white smoke at night.ImageReacting as black smoke rises from the Sistine Chapel chimney on Thursday morning.Credit...Amanda Perobelli/ReutersAnticipation had been building in St. Peter’s Square on Thursday morning as people started to think in earnest that the cardinals would elect a new pope. But when the first smoke of the day came, just before noon, it was black — indicating that there was still no consensus inside the Sistine Chapel, where the cardinals were voting.Because the past two conclaves to elect Francis and Benedict XVI lasted two days, many of the faithful and tourists milling around the square as a light morning rain turned into bright sunshine said they expected white smoke on Thursday but not until the evening.So when the black smoke came at midday, most were not that surprised, training their cellphones on the giant screens flanking the square where they could see the smoke pumping out of the chimney.Judith Duru, 22, a nursing student in Rome from Nigeria, filmed the smoke on the screen because she could not see the actual smoke from where she was standing. She said she trusted the cardinals to select a “pope with a good heart, who can care for your people, understand your people.” Although she comes from a continent with a fast-growing Catholic population, she said she did not care where the new pope hailed from.“I don’t do politics and religion,” she said. “It does not matter to me” where he comes from, she added. “A good pope will touch everyone.”Before the first smoke signal of the day, Joaquín Cáceres, 30, and Lucía Pérez, 28, Argentines who live in Spain, said they had made a wager on Wednesday night after seeing the first plume of black smoke come out of the Sistine Chapel chimney.“He thinks this morning, on the third ballot,” Ms. Pérez said.“She thinks this afternoon, on the fifth ballot — like Francis,” Mr. Cáceres said.Although neither had a favorite contender, both said they hoped the cardinals would want to continue Francis’ work.“The conclave and the Holy Spirit always work in mysterious ways,” Ms. Pérez said. “But they don’t turn a deaf ear to what people say.”The crowd on Thursday morning was decidedly smaller than the many thousands of people who attended on Wednesday night, probably because a lot of Italians were at work, but perhaps also indicative of expectations that white smoke was more likely to come in the evening. The crowd remained heavily international on Thursday morning, with flags from across the world on view.Several onlookers said they planned to stick around all day — and came prepared.Philipp and Kathrin Wilmes, tourists from Germany, crammed their sightseeing into Monday and Tuesday so that they could wait for six hours in St. Peter’s Square on Wednesday to see the smoke. On Thursday, Mr. Wilmes, 45, had slathered his face with sunscreen expecting another long day. He and his wife, 39, had jackets, bread and water in their backpacks because they said they did not plan to move from their spot against the barrier closest to the basilica. The couple had tickets to fly back to Germany on Friday, and were hoping for an election before then.Maciej Czaharyn, 33, who is Polish but lives in Iceland, spent seven hours in the square on Wednesday. “I was standing all the time,” he said. “But it was worth the sacrifice.”On Thursday, Mr. Czaharyn brought a thin cushion to sit on the ground and a grocery bag filled with bottles of electrolyte drinks, chocolate cookies and cigarettes, “even though you can’t smoke in here,” he said.A group of sophomores from the University of Dallas, a Catholic school, had been studying near Marino, Italy, this year and extended their stay for the conclave. They sat in a circle on the ground playing a card game. They had a large bag of chocolate chip cookies and sandwich fixings.Some Italians found their way to St. Peter’s, too.Flavia Valle, 16, who was lying on the cobblestones not far from the barrier closest to the basilica, said that she and several friends were skipping high school.“I want to see the pope come out,” she said, pointing at the balcony framed by thick, red velvet curtains where the new pontiff traditionally makes a first appearance once the white smoke signals his election.She said she was hoping for another charismatic pope in the mode of Francis. “He talked to the guys, people my age,” she said. “I liked him.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTA call for ‘unity’ in the conclave sounds divisive to some.ImageCardinals returned to St. Peter’s Basilica after Pope Francis’ funeral in April.Credit...James Hill for The New York TimesEven before Pope Francis was entombed in a Rome basilica, conservative cardinals who felt his pontificate was a divisive disaster that endangered the church’s traditions had begun politicking to sway the conclave.They have a seductively simple slogan: unity.It is hard to imagine a less offensive rallying cry, but in the ears of Francis’ most committed supporters, it rings as a code word for rolling back Francis’ more inclusive vision of the Roman Catholic Church.The concerns are a clear sign of the maneuvering by ideological camps as the cardinals vote for Francis’ successor. Among the deeply contested issues are whether the next pope should push forward, or roll back, Francis’ openness to potentially ordaining women as deacons, making some married men clergy or offering communion to divorced and remarried Catholics.Some progressives within the church worry that the dozens of new cardinals Francis chose around the world will be less versed in Vaticanese and may be taken in by the sweetness of the unity siren.“It sounds really good,” said Cardinal Michael Czerny of Canada, who was one of Francis’ closest advisers, but “it means reversal.”“The black smoke is not surprising. The cardinals need some time to decide.”John Trecker, 39, a software engineer from Kansas City.Videotranscriptbars0:00/0:24-0:00transcriptI lost count, but I think the second or third black smoke is not surprising. The Cardinals need some time to decide. This is the most diverse set of cardinals, the biggest number in ever. And they don’t know each other. They need to understand the needs of the church now, and each other, before they can make a good decision. Yeah, but we’re here just to pray for them to make that decision.An Italian cardinal, Gianfranco Ravasi, who is 82 and not voting in the conclave, said that he had been impressed by a speech from Cardinal Jean-Marc Aveline of Marseille, France, who has emerged as a papal contender. Cardinal Aveline, who is learning Italian, read his speech in “perfect Italian,” Cardinal Ravasi said, adding, “He only got two accents wrong.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTWhile younger cardinals are busy choosing the new pope, older cardinals are mostly waiting it out like the rest of us (cardinals over age 80 are not allowed to vote). But many have attended meetings with the other, voting cardinals over the past two weeks, so they have thoughts about the next pontiff. The Vatican’s spokesman declined to say what time the voting began this morning, so it is hard to say how long it took the cardinals to cast their ballots in each vote.The black smoke suggests that three votes have now taken place, and a two-thirds majority has not been reached.VideoCreditCredit...Vatican Media, via ReutersAt first there was a gasp in the press room because the smoke looked a little white... but two seconds later, it was very clearly black.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHundreds of people in St. Peter’s Square raised their cell phones to the giant screens that showed the black smoke rising.

Here’s a glossary with some of the key words and phrases that are used in the process after a pope dies.A convent asks people to spiritually adopt a voting cardinal.ImageOn a convent’s website, people can pick a cardinal to support with prayer in the election of the pope.Credit...James Hill for The New York TimesA convent in a Northern Italian seaside city is encouraging people to pick a voting cardinal to accompany in prayer through its “Adopt a Cardinal” initiative.The convent, in Rimini in the Emilia-Romagna region, is calling on the faithful to pray for a cardinal to be guided by the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary in his choice for a new pope.People can sign up at a local church in Rimini or through the website of the convent, which houses a community of Poor Clares, also known as the Clarisses.The nuns have been clear that it is not a popularity contest. “We specify that this not a poll nor a Toto-Papa,” the website says, referring to the term for papal election predictions much used by Italian journalists. “We are not inviting people to choose the one who will become pope, but rather a cardinal to accompany with a special prayer in the election of the pope.”According to the site, all 133 cardinals have been adopted by at least one person. As of Thursday morning, 1,173 people had made a choice.No word on who has the most prayers.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTPeople are gathering in St. Peter’s Square to wait for the outcome of the next secret ballot.I just crossed the Tiber River on the Ponte Sant’Angelo. As soon as I rounded the corner and looked down the boulevard to St. Peter’s Basilica, the rich red drapes on its central balcony popped out.

Yesterday, as the hours stretched on and the Vatican’s live video stream was trained on a chimney atop the Sistine Chapel that was not billowing smoke, gulls kept landing on the nearby roof, sometimes to increasingly insistent clapping from those waiting in the square.

The cardinals were scheduled to hold a Mass and prayers before heading to the Sistine Chapel for a second round of voting.With no result — and no smoke — expected imminently, St. Peter’s Square was almost deserted in the early morning, except for a few tourists and tour groups. But by 10 a.m., a crowd had started to gather. Few people looked up at the chimney of the Sistine Chapel — the focus of the Wednesday night’s anticipation.Lorena Belloso, 48, from Argentina and her husband were among the few in the square. “We came for a vacation to Spain and Italy, but we are Catholic believers and now we are waiting for the new pope,” she said. “It’s a historic moment.”On Wednesday evening, tens of thousands of people packed the square to wait for the outcome of the first ballot. A result had been expected early in the evening, but it wasn’t until 9 p.m. that black smoke rose from the chimney, signaling that the cardinals had not reached a consensus on a new pope. Applause, cheers and gasps of disappointment broke out among the crowd, which quickly vacated the square.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTStarting today, the cardinals will vote twice in the morning and twice in the afternoon. There will be smoke at the end of the morning session and the afternoon session, unless a pope is elected earlier.The cardinals were scheduled to hold a Mass and morning prayers at the Apostolic Palace early on Thursday before heading to the Sistine Chapel for a second round of voting. The events will unfold behind closed doors, with no result — or smoke — expected for hours. St. Peter’s Square was deserted other than a few tourists and tour groups. The evening before, the square had been packed with an expectant crowd. No phones, no internet: The cardinals vote in extreme secrecy.ImageThe process of selecting a new pope, which takes place in the Sistine Chapel, is intended to be leakproof.Credit...Dimitar Dilkoff/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesNo cellphones. No internet. No television. No contact with the outside world. Welcome to the conclave, which some security experts say is the most secure vote anywhere.The ancient, closed-door selection process that began in the Sistine Chapel on Wednesday was intended to be leakproof. Popes have been fine-tuning the procedure for centuries.The last major changes to the rules came in 1996 and were laid out in a document written by Pope John Paul II, “Universi Dominici Gregis: On the Vacancy of the Apostolic See and the Election of the Roman Pontiff.”Before a single vote was cast on Wednesday, the chapel was cleared of all but the cardinal electors. (This time there are 133 of them.) The room was swept for listening and transmission devices. The windows were boarded up. Jamming devices are routinely used, to ensure that the proceedings cannot be interfered with, or snooped on.The participants all took an oath to uphold the sanctity — and, in essence, the security — of the vote. The process is almost entirely tech-free: Cardinals write their votes by hand on paper ballots, and then proceed one at a time to the altar to place their ballots in an urn.Nine cardinals oversee the process. Three are known as “scrutineers,” tasked with counting and recounting the votes and three are “revisers” who double-check their work.All of this creates “enormous social — religious, actually — disincentives to hacking the vote” or leaking details, Bruce Schneier, a security expert and lecturer at Harvard Kennedy School, wrote in a 2005 blog post.Twenty years later, with smartphones and recording devices nearly everywhere, Mr. Schneier reflected on the security of the voting. In an interview last week, he said that he still considered the conclave to be nearly hackproof. (On a scale of one to 10, with 10 being unhackable, Mr. Schneier gave it a 9.9.)“It’s a small manual process, which makes it more secure,” he added. But that also makes it nearly impossible to replicate for national elections. “There are no lessons for the real world,” he said, “because it doesn’t scale.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHow long will the conclave take?No one knows how long the conclave will last.There is no formal time limit: until two-thirds of the 133 voting Roman Catholic cardinals agree on a new pope, they must continue to vote. Past papal selections have lasted from just a few hours to nearly three years. In the 13th century, the tradition of sequestering the cardinals during the conclave started after residents in Viterbo, near Rome, where it was being held, grew frustrated with a selection process that dragged on almost three years. Locals locked the squabbling cardinals in the papal palace in Viterbo and had the roof removed, subjecting them to the elements. They also cut down their food rations until they made a selection. Pope Gregory X finally emerged as their choice after 33 months.It’s no wonder that Gregory X scrambled to come up with fixed rules for the conclave, which comes from the Latin “with key.” They included reducing meals to one a day if a pope was not elected after three days, and to only bread and water after five more days. But some papal elections continued to drag on. In the 17th and 18th centuries, European Catholic monarchies used their influence over loyal cardinals to shape the outcome, meaning that votes sometimes dragged on for months.Conclaves have become considerably shorter in the past two centuries, after the end of the pope’s temporal power in 1870.The last two popes, Francis and Benedict XVI, were each elected within two days.Cardinals provided varying estimates of how long this conclave would last. Some said the process may take longer than recent selections because the members of the large and diverse College of Cardinals, many of them appointed by Pope Francis in recent years, don’t know each other well. Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan of New York said he thought the conclave would be longer than the one that elected Francis. He has packed 12 packets of peanut butter, and enough to eat three a day. “I think it’ll be longer than last time,” he said.Others predict the cardinals will converge on a well-known name and wrap it up fast.“Everyone says that, but I don’t know how they know,” Cardinal Anders Arborelius of Sweden said in a recent interview. Maybe, he said, “Everyone wants to get home as soon as possible.” Elizabeth Dias contributed reporting.When will the cardinals vote next?ImagePeople watching a screen in St. Peter’s Square showing cardinals in the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican on Wednesday.Credit...Amanda Perobelli/ReutersVoting for the next pope will resume on Thursday morning and continue four times a day until a two-thirds majority reaches a consensus.The next vote by the 133 cardinals gathered in a conclave in Vatican City is expected to take place around 10:30 a.m. local time (4:30 a.m. Eastern), and the second around noon.If neither vote is successful, the next two ballots will take place around 5:30 p.m. and 7 p.m. on Thursday.Casting, reading and incinerating the secret ballots can take a while, so those times are only estimates.The voting procedure is precisely choreographed. All 133 voting cardinals must write the name of the man he sees as pope on a rectangular piece of paper under the phrase “Eligo in Summum Pontificem,” or “I elect as the supreme pontiff.” Cardinals individually walk their ballots to the chapel’s altar, where they say an oath in Latin, and leave the ballot on a plate.Votes are counted before being read aloud and pierced and tied together with a red string (the “Conclave” film depicted this practice). After ballots are counted, they are burned.Smoke emerges from the Sistine Chapel up to twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Black smoke tells the world that the cardinals haven’t reached a decision; white smoke announces that a new pope has been chosen.Both of the past two popes — Benedict XVI in 2005 and Francis in 2013 — were elected in two days. For the past two centuries, each pope was selected within four days or fewer.The cardinal electors will take Sunday off for prayer if a pope has not been selected by Saturday afternoon.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTPaper ballots and sacred oaths: the objects guiding the conclave.The conclave to elect the next pope is now underway at the Vatican. The cardinals — the prelates who are just below the pope in the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy — will vote by secret ballot for a successor to Pope Francis until one candidate earns a two-thirds majority.While we may not know what’s being said during the conclave — it is off limits to outsiders — we do have a pretty good idea what it will look like. During the gathering, the cardinals will follow specific instructions and use several distinctive objects to facilitate the process, many steeped in tradition.Here’s a look at some of those objects, and the meaning behind them.Voting InstrumentsWhen the cardinals vote in the Sistine Chapel, they will be sitting in rows of simple wooden tables. At one end of the chapel, a large table is set up for those who run the voting, according to the Universi Dominici Gregis, or U.D.G., one of the documents used to govern the papal transition.The room also contains voting instruments, including an urn to receive the ballots, a set of wooden balls, and a needle and twine. The urn is used to collect the ballots, rectangular pieces of paper printed with the Latin phrase “Eligo in Summum Pontificem” (“I elect as Supreme Pontiff”).The ballots contain a space where each cardinal writes in the name of his chosen candidate. The ballots are placed in the urn and are removed for counting after all the cardinals have voted.The wooden balls are used to keep track of the ballots. The balls have numbers written on them that correspond to the number of cardinals voting in the conclave. As the ballots are being counted, an attendant removes one of the wooden balls for each ballot, to ensure that the number matches the number of cardinals, according to The Catholic Advocate, formerly a newspaper of the Archdiocese of Newark, N.J. If the numbers don’t match, the ballots must be burned without being read and another vote is conducted immediately, according to the U.D.G.As the ballots are being read, they are pierced with the needle through the word “Eligo” and strung onto the thread, “so that the ballots can be more securely preserved,” according to the U.D.G.ImageMembers of the clergy and conclave staff taking the oath of secrecy in the Pauline Chapel earlier this week.Credit...The VaticanThe Oath of SecrecyThe conclave is a secretive institution, and many steps are taken to prevent leaks, including restricting the cardinals’ use of phones, the internet and newspapers.The members of the College of Cardinals, the body that will elect the pope, must also swear and sign an oath of secrecy, according to the U.D.G. The oath reads, in part: “I will observe absolute and perpetual secrecy with all who are not part of the College of Cardinal electors concerning all matters directly or indirectly related to the ballots cast and their scrutiny for the election of the Supreme Pontiff.”The cardinals also must promise not to record anything in Vatican City during the time of the election. The punishment for breaking the oath is “automatic” excommunication, according to the oath.ImageA temporary stove in the Sistine Chapel in a photo provided by the Vatican.Credit...The VaticanThe StoveThe weekend before the conclave began, Vatican workers installed a simple stove in which ballots would be burned in the Sistine Chapel. Fire crews also installed a chimney on the roof of the chapel, where the smoke will leave the building.After each round of voting, the ballots are mixed with chemicals that, when burned, emit either black or white smoke. Black smoke means that the cardinals have not yet reached the requisite majority; white smoke means that a new pope has been elected and voting is over.The SealAt the beginning of the conclave, the Apostolic Palace, which contains the Sistine Chapel, is closed to the public. On Wednesday, members of the Pontifical Swiss Guard placed beaded ropes with the guard’s seal at the entrances to the palace to ensure privacy and maintain secrecy for the cardinals.The Vatican City government also planned to deactivate cellphone service within its territory for the duration of the conclave, starting on Wednesday afternoon.The Papal VestmentsAfter a pope is elected, he is taken to the “Room of Tears,” a small room next to the Sistine Chapel, where he will put on the white papal cassock for the first time. Garments in three sizes are prepared and kept in the room, since no one knows who — or what size — the next pope will be.The room is known as the “Room of Tears” because there are accounts of previous popes becoming overwhelmed with emotion in the room, and being moved to tears, after their election. After the pope puts on the vestments, he is introduced to the public for the first time.\\n```\\n\\n## [Waiting for the Smoke That Heralds a New Pope](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/world/europe/papal-conclave-st-peters-square-smoke.html) (#46996)\\n\\n> 2025-05-07 21:45:49+00:00\\n\\n```\\nAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTYou have a preview view of this article while we are checking your access.

By smoke.The highly secret voting began inside what is possibly one of the world’s most secure vaults in the early evening, with the 133 cardinals tasked with deciding who will succeed Pope Francis writing candidates’ names on voting cards by hand, trying to disguise their handwriting.Outside in St. Peter’s Square, thousands of the faithful, the curious and the vacationing gathered to await the news of whether the cardinals had managed to elect a papal successor. Word came at 9 p.m., in the form of black smoke billowing from a chimney installed last week on the roof of the chapel.If the smoke had been white, it would have meant that the cardinals had chosen the first new pope in a dozen years in just one round of voting, a feat not seen for centuries.But the black smoke, created when the cardinals’ ballots are incinerated in a cast-iron stove, means they’ll have to try again.“We are cold, we’re hungry, we’re thirsty but yet we can’t move,” said the Rev. Peter Mangum, 61, a priest at the Church of Jesus the Good Shepherd in Monroe, La. He and three other priests had been in the square for about seven hours, and it was Father Mangum’s fourth time waiting for news of a new pope.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

The cardinals, the most ever to gather in a papal conclave, will retire to guest quarters at the Vatican and return on Thursday morning to continue voting. They will remain isolated during their deliberations, without phone or internet access and under oaths of total secrecy, until a two-thirds majority agrees on a candidate.The first conclave in more than a decade, a little more than two weeks after Pope Francis’ death set in motion the process of choosing his successor, comes during an uncertain time for the church, which is facing difficult decisions about its future direction, strained finances and a reckoning over past sexual abuse scandals.After a morning Mass, the conclave began as the cardinals, all men and nearly all over age 50, filed in a solemn procession into the Sistine Chapel, where they took assigned seats at long wooden tables under the soaring frescoes of Renaissance masters.The papal election is one of the world’s oldest dramas, but this one is unlike any before it, with many cardinals appointed by Francis meeting one another for the first time. The new faces bring unfamiliar politics, priorities and concerns that some experts say could make the selection process more fragmented than usual. Francis also left the church deeply divided, with progressive factions pushing for more inclusion and change and conservatives seeking to roll things back, often under the guise of preserving unity.Here’s what to know:How it works: The cardinals will participate in four rounds of voting every day until a candidate achieves a two-thirds majority. The ballots are burned after two rounds of voting, and the smoke above the Sistine Chapel signals whether a decision has been made — black smoke for no decision, white if there is a pope. There is no indication of how long it will take, though the last two conclaves reached decisions within two days.Possible successors: Predicting the outcome of a papal election is always challenging, but oddsmakers say that two top contenders are Cardinal Pietro Parolin of Italy, who was Francis’ second-in-command, and Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of the Philippines, a country where the church is growing rapidly.Referendum on Francis: The election in many ways will turn on whether the cardinals want a pope who will follow Francis’ path of openness and inclusion or forge a different one. During his 12-year pontificate, Francis made global headlines for landmark declarations that encouraged liberals, including allowing the blessing of people in same-sex unions and raising his voice for migrants.Test your knowledge: How well do you know the process of selecting a pope?

All 133 voting cardinals must write the name of the man he sees as pope on a rectangular piece of paper under the phrase “Eligo in Summum Pontificem,” or “I elect as the supreme pontiff.” Cardinals individually walk their ballots to the chapel’s altar, where they say an oath in Latin, and leave the ballot on a plate.Votes are counted before being read aloud and pierced and tied together with a red string (the “Conclave” film depicted this practice). After ballots are counted, they are burned.Smoke emerges from the Sistine Chapel up to twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Black smoke tells the world that the cardinals haven’t reached a decision; white smoke announces that a new pope has been chosen.Both of the past two popes — Benedict XVI in 2005 and Francis in 2013 — were elected in two days. For the past two centuries, each pope was selected within four days or fewer.The cardinal electors will take Sunday off for prayer if a pope has not been selected by Saturday afternoon.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTPaper ballots and sacred oaths: the objects guiding the conclave.The conclave to elect the next pope is now underway at the Vatican. The cardinals — the prelates who are just below the pope in the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy — will vote by secret ballot for a successor to Pope Francis until one candidate earns a two-thirds majority.While we may not know what’s being said during the conclave — it is off limits to outsiders — we do have a pretty good idea what it will look like. During the gathering, the cardinals will follow specific instructions and use several distinctive objects to facilitate the process, many steeped in tradition.Here’s a look at some of those objects, and the meaning behind them.Voting InstrumentsWhen the cardinals vote in the Sistine Chapel, they will be sitting in rows of simple wooden tables. At one end of the chapel, a large table is set up for those who run the voting, according to the Universi Dominici Gregis, or U.D.G., one of the documents used to govern the papal transition.The room also contains voting instruments, including an urn to receive the ballots, a set of wooden balls, and a needle and twine. The urn is used to collect the ballots, rectangular pieces of paper printed with the Latin phrase “Eligo in Summum Pontificem” (“I elect as Supreme Pontiff”).The ballots contain a space where each cardinal writes in the name of his chosen candidate. The ballots are placed in the urn and are removed for counting after all the cardinals have voted.The wooden balls are used to keep track of the ballots. The balls have numbers written on them that correspond to the number of cardinals voting in the conclave. As the ballots are being counted, an attendant removes one of the wooden balls for each ballot, to ensure that the number matches the number of cardinals, according to The Catholic Advocate, formerly a newspaper of the Archdiocese of Newark, N.J. If the numbers don’t match, the ballots must be burned without being read and another vote is conducted immediately, according to the U.D.G.As the ballots are being read, they are pierced with the needle through the word “Eligo” and strung onto the thread, “so that the ballots can be more securely preserved,” according to the U.D.G.ImageMembers of the clergy and conclave staff taking the oath of secrecy in the Pauline Chapel earlier this week.Credit...The VaticanThe Oath of SecrecyThe conclave is a secretive institution, and many steps are taken to prevent leaks, including restricting the cardinals’ use of phones, the internet and newspapers.The members of the College of Cardinals, the body that will elect the pope, must also swear and sign an oath of secrecy, according to the U.D.G. The oath reads, in part: “I will observe absolute and perpetual secrecy with all who are not part of the College of Cardinal electors concerning all matters directly or indirectly related to the ballots cast and their scrutiny for the election of the Supreme Pontiff.”The cardinals also must promise not to record anything in Vatican City during the time of the election. The punishment for breaking the oath is “automatic” excommunication, according to the oath.ImageA temporary stove in the Sistine Chapel in a photo provided by the Vatican.Credit...The VaticanThe StoveThe weekend before the conclave began, Vatican workers installed a simple stove in which ballots would be burned in the Sistine Chapel. Fire crews also installed a chimney on the roof of the chapel, where the smoke will leave the building.After each round of voting, the ballots are mixed with chemicals that, when burned, emit either black or white smoke. Black smoke means that the cardinals have not yet reached the requisite majority; white smoke means that a new pope has been elected and voting is over.The SealAt the beginning of the conclave, the Apostolic Palace, which contains the Sistine Chapel, is closed to the public. On Wednesday, members of the Pontifical Swiss Guard placed beaded ropes with the guard’s seal at the entrances to the palace to ensure privacy and maintain secrecy for the cardinals.The Vatican City government also planned to deactivate cellphone service within its territory for the duration of the conclave, starting on Wednesday afternoon.The Papal VestmentsAfter a pope is elected, he is taken to the “Room of Tears,” a small room next to the Sistine Chapel, where he will put on the white papal cassock for the first time. Garments in three sizes are prepared and kept in the room, since no one knows who — or what size — the next pope will be.The room is known as the “Room of Tears” because there are accounts of previous popes becoming overwhelmed with emotion in the room, and being moved to tears, after their election. After the pope puts on the vestments, he is introduced to the public for the first time.The faithful and the curious gather in St. Peter’s Square.ImageThe crowd in St. Peter’s Square reacts to the black smoke emanating from a Vatican chimney, indicating no decision has been made on a new pope. Credit...Eloisa Lopez/ReutersAfter the men who will select the next pope were locked inside the Sistine Chapel without cellphones on Wednesday, the only thing left to do was wait for them to send a signal to the outside world. By smoke.The highly secret voting began inside what is possibly one of the world’s most secure vaults in the early evening, with the 133 cardinals tasked with deciding who will succeed Pope Francis writing candidates’ names on voting cards by hand, trying to disguise their handwriting.Outside in St. Peter’s Square, thousands of the faithful, the curious and the vacationing gathered to await the news of whether the cardinals had managed to elect a papal successor. Word came at 9 p.m., in the form of black smoke billowing from a chimney installed last week on the roof of the chapel.If the smoke had been white, it would have meant that the cardinals had chosen the first new pope in a dozen years in just one round of voting, a feat not seen for centuries.But the black smoke, created when the cardinals’ ballots are incinerated in a cast-iron stove, means they’ll have to try again.“We are cold, we’re hungry, we’re thirsty but yet we can’t move,” said the Rev. Peter Mangum, 61, a priest at the Church of Jesus the Good Shepherd in Monroe, La. He and three other priests had been in the square for about seven hours, and it was Father Mangum’s fourth time waiting for news of a new pope.He had stood in the same spot for the elections of John Paul II, Benedict XVI and Francis, and he wasn’t going to budge until he knew Wednesday’s news. “We had to make sure the smoke was black,” he said.ImageThe black smoke flowing out from the Sistine Chapel on Wednesday night. Credit...Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesIt took two days to elect Pope Francis in 2013 and Benedict XVI in 2005. No conclave in the 20th or 21st centuries has lasted more than five days.In an era when news travels instantly around the world, the patience-requiring wait for the smoke in St. Peter’s Square is a ritual that dates back to the 19th century.For some, the anxiety was intense. “I think there’s more nervousness among the people outside than among the cardinals themselves,” said Tania Radesca, who arrived at the square at 1 p.m.Ms. Radesca, who is from Venezuela, had volunteered to help during the Jubilee, a year of pilgrimage that happens every 25 years, and she arrived in Rome just over a month ago. She was in St. Peter’s Square on Easter Sunday and caught a final glimpse of Pope Francis in his popemobile.He died a day later.Those who arrived early to score spots at the barricades closest to the front of St. Peter’s Basilica draped flags from their home countries along the barriers and befriended each other as they settled in. Others camped out on yoga mats or picnic blankets.ImageNuns praying at St. Peter’s Square as the conclave to elect the next pope gets underway, at the Vatican on Wednesday.Credit...Jeff Pachoud/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesMany had traveled a long way, specifically for the conclave. Rodrigo Pinto, 43, a retired karate instructor, flew 23 hours from Guatemala, landing on Tuesday afternoon and heading straight to St. Peter’s Square on Wednesday so he could wait for the first sign of smoke.Mr. Pinto, who was wearing a rosary, said, “I want to be a part of something I have always seen on TV, in documentaries, on the internet.” After standing in the rain in the morning and under the hot sun in the afternoon, he said, “Three hours ago, it was like hell. Sorry, St. Peter.”In a post office inside the square, Jennifer Raulli, 54, wrote postcards to her college-age children in the United States. She was in Rome on vacation with one of her daughters, who just graduated from Texas Christian University, and had gotten tickets to see Pope Francis say Mass on Wednesday. Instead, they arrived at the square to wait for the smoke that might herald the man who replaces him.“It is going to be a long couple of hours, but I would not miss it,” said Ms. Raulli, who had traveled from Pasadena, Calif. Ms. Raulli, who was raised Presbyterian and converted to Catholicism when she was 37, said she would prefer a “more conservative” pope because she would like the church to be “less politicized” and close to her vision of biblical teachings. The day of waiting began at 10 a.m. when Giovanni Battista Re, the spry, 91-year-old dean of the College of Cardinals, presided over a Mass inside St. Peter’s Basilica and implored the voting cardinals to choose “a pope who knows how best to awaken the consciences of all, and the moral and spiritual energies in today’s society.”As the cardinals gave each other the sign of peace during the service, Cardinal Re hugged Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican secretary of state under Francis and considered a leading candidate to succeed him. A microphone caught Cardinal Re wishing Cardinal Parolin best wishes.Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, another potential candidate who appeared with a fresh haircut, warmly shook his peers’ hands. Cardinal Jean-Marc Aveline, the archbishop of Marseille and also considered a papal contender, stopped for a prayer in front of the reliquary containing the remains of Pope John XXIII — a hero to many liberal Catholics for his efforts to modernize the church.ImageItalian cardinal Matteo Maria Zuppi, right, attends a Mass before the start of the conclave, at St. Peter’s Basilica in The Vatican.Credit...Dimitar Dilkoff/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesAfter lunch at the Casa Santa Marta, the lodging house inside the Vatican where the electors will stay throughout the conclave, the cardinals walked to the Sistine Chapel. As they proceeded into the chapel, they chanted the Litany of the Saints, while a choir hauntingly invoked the names of the saints. The cardinals replied with “Ora pro nobis,” or “Pray for us.” Outside in the square, many watching on the large video screens flanking the basilica swayed and echoed the cardinals’ chant.Inside the Sistine Chapel, name tags for the cardinals had been placed on the long tables where they would vote. Francis named many more cardinals than his two predecessors, some from countries far from the Vatican, and many of the papal electors — and potential popes — do not know one another.Around 5:45 p.m., Archbishop Diego Giovanni Ravelli, the master of pontifical liturgical celebrations, announced “extra omnes,” a Latin phrase that means “everybody out.” The giant wooden doors were closed, leaving the 133 cardinal electors — those under the age of 80 who can vote in the secret ballot — locked inside.ImageThe crowd in St. Peter’s Square watching a giant video screen displaying images of Diego Giovanni Ravelli, the master of pontifical liturgical celebrations, closing the doors of the Sistine Chapel.Credit...Andreas Solaro/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe cardinals will not be allowed to leave the Vatican until a two-thirds majority agrees on the next pope. Phones, internet, television and any contact from outside the Vatican walls are prohibited, a custom enforced to discourage the process from dragging on.Some veteran electors believed there would be prolonged voting. “Bring a book,” Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan of New York said he advised other cardinals, in an interview on Tuesday. The conclave began 16 days after Francis’ death on April 21. The significance of the moment was not lost even on those who had little knowledge of Catholicism.Yuichiro Yamakoshi, 41, a Japanese tourist traveling with his wife, said that after touring the Vatican museums and walking through the doors of the four main basilicas that are usually open only during the Jubilee, he started to understand the power and influence of the faith. Although the couple had come to St. Peter’s Square on Tuesday with a guide, they returned on Wednesday morning for a commemorative photo marking the conclave.As the black smoke dissipated into the sky, all there was to do was wait for another day.Of all the people coincidentally in Rome for the start of the papal conclave on Wednesday, the pilgrims from St. Cecilia Catholic Church in Houston may have had among the most poignant stories. The 47 faithful who had traveled with their priest — also coincidentally named Francis — to Rome this week had scheduled a meeting with Pope Francis on Wednesday. Instead, they were in St. Peter’s Square during the final Mass before the conclave beginning later in the day.One of the group, George Smith, 69, said, “It is a blessing for us.”As a river of people streamed out of the square, a group of Romans who had been convinced the smoke would be white shook hands and hugged. “See you tomorrow!” they said.ImageThe densely packed crowd in St. Peter’s Square on Wednesday night.Credit...Andrej Isakovic/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesReporting was contributed by Emma Bubola, Elisabetta Povoledo, Jason Horowitz, Elizabeth Dias, Matthew Mpoke Bigg, Bernhard Warner and Josephine de La Bruyère.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSurvivors call on the next pope to end sexual abuse by clergy.ImageThe Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests is one of several survivors groups to have arrived in Rome since Pope Francis died.Credit...Andrew Medichini/Associated PressAs cardinals prepared to enter the Sistine Chapel on Wednesday afternoon to elect a pope, groups representing survivors of sexual abuse by priests made last-minute appeals for the next pontiff to definitively resolve the crisis, which has shadowed the Roman Catholic Church for decades.The best way forward, the groups said, was to impose a zero-tolerance policy on transgressors and those who covered up for them, and for church leaders to own up to their own mishandling of abuse cases.“We want to work with the next pope to put an end to clerical abuse,” Peter Isely, a member of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, known as SNAP, said Wednesday at a news conference.In March, the group launched a website tracking each cardinal’s record in dealing with credible allegations against priests under his watch. Few in the upper echelons of the church’s hierarchy are without blame, the group claimed.On Friday, Matteo Bruni, the Vatican spokesman, said the cardinals had discussed sexual abuse in the run-up to the conclave and considered it a “wound to be kept open” so awareness of the problem remained alive and solutions could be identified.SNAP also presented a road map for the pope’s first 100 days, describing steps its members think he should take to resolve the crisis.SNAP is only one of several survivors groups to have arrived in Rome since Pope Francis died on April 21, hoping their message will resonate with the cardinals.One international group, Ending Clergy Abuse, or ECA, echoed Martin Luther’s radical 1517 call for church reform on Tuesday evening when it brought a manifesto — titled the 95 Theses of Survivors — to the front door of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Vatican office that handles most abuse cases. They did not nail it to the door, but tried to slip it between the doors.“I rang the doorbell but they didn’t answer,” said Gemma Hickey, the president of ECA, who is a survivor of abuse. It was not until they started reading the document out loud that the door opened and an official took it. “He didn’t say anything, but it was received, so I was happy with that, even if it was just symbolic.”Francesco Zanardi, the founder of Rete L’Abuso, Italy’s largest survivors’ group, said at a news conference on Tuesday that the church laws promoted by Pope Francis to guide bishops in handling abuse were often thwarted in Italy because national laws do not force bishops to report cases of abuse to law enforcement officials.Speaking out against clerical abuse is not always without consequence. Ann Hagan Webb and Anne Barrett Doyle, of BishopAccountability.org, an archive and advocacy group, said the police stopped them when they were walking near the Vatican office that handles abuse cases holding photos of two cardinals whose records on punishing abusers have drawn scrutiny.“They told us we couldn’t carry signs,” Ms. Barrett Doyle said. The police officers took photos of their documents and called other police officers before letting them go after about 45 minutes. “At least they didn’t arrest us,” she said.Under Pope Francis, the Vatican took decidedly stronger steps than it had in the past to counter sexual abuse.Francis issued the church’s most comprehensive law yet to hold clerics accountable if they sexually abused children or vulnerable adults, or if they covered up abuse. And he apologized to survivors on many occasions, acknowledging their pain. But critics have said that the measures were not enough and often were not applied because of resistance within the church.Come for the conclave, not for the food.ImagePope Francis having lunch at the Vatican in 2018. His emphasis on simple living and humility extended to the food he ate.Credit...Vincenzo Pinto/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe cardinals gathering for the conclave hope to pick the very best among them to be the leader of the Roman Catholic Church. Their culinary expectations are not so high.“Food you could eat at a train station” was how Cardinal Mauro Piacenza, a conclave veteran from the Italian city of Genoa, famous for its pesto, described the fare at the Casa Santa Marta, a guesthouse in the Vatican where the cardinals will be staying during the conclave. By train station food, he said he meant pastas with “watery sauce,” simple cutlets and salads: “Not exciting.”The ambience at Santa Marta isn’t much of a draw, either. Its cafeteria has pale green columns, utilitarian furniture and fan art in the hallway depicting Francis as a Jedi knight in “Star Wars.” But priests would angle for a reservation there because Santa Marta was the home of Pope Francis. Until he began ailing and taking his meals in his room, the pope often ate in the cafeteria at a table between the window and the refrigerator.Among the residents of the guesthouse, Francis, with his emphasis on simple living and humility, bore some blame for the decline in the food. Some lamented bland vegetables, less-than-rich pastas and leftovers from gifts to the pope — a box of dates from the Middle East, for example.Across the ideological spectrum, a consensus emerged.“You don’t eat very well,” said Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi of Italy, a supporter of Pope Francis.“It’s not so good,” said Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller of Germany, who was fired by Francis.The food at the conclave isn’t supposed to be good.The tradition of locking in the cardinals began in the 13th century, after residents of Viterbo, a town north of Rome where the election was being held, grew so frustrated with the process, which was taking years, that they ripped the roof off the building where the cardinals were meeting and reduced the menu to bread and water. The pope who came out of that election, Gregory X, decreed in 1274 that after three days of conclave, cardinals would get only one meal a day. The more days they took, the less food they got.But election menus improved. Centuries later, conclave food deliveries were inspected for secret messages — easily stuffable pies and chickens were verboten — and passed to the cardinals through a revolving door.When a 16th-century cardinal died during a conclave, some others claimed the food was poisoned. In the conclave that lasted from November 1549 to February 1550, the famed Vatican cook Bartolomeo Scappi noted that cardinals took turns acting as poison testers. Once it was clear the food was safe, they drank from carafes of wine and ate from hampers full of food.Scappi doesn’t say exactly what he fed them, but Crystal King, the author of a novel about the chef, wrote that her research led her to conclude they ate “ravioli and rabbit pappardelle” and “cheesy breads, veal croquettes, roasted bear, grilled beef ribs, open-faced mushroom crostatas, pheasant in red-currant sauce and maybe even caviar omelets.”Times have changed, and though Santa Marta is not exactly serving bread and water, the cardinals preparing to vote for the next pope know not to bring their appetites.“We will eat whatever they give us,” Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo Besungu of Congo said on Sunday. When told by a reporter about a subpar dining experience at the Santa Marta mess hall, he joked, “And you’re not dead.” He said that one had to have “trust in the Holy Spirit.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTFather Peter Mangum, of Monroe, La, waited for three hours in the same spot he had stood when the cardinals selected John Paul II, Benedict XVI and Francis. “We had to make sure the smoke was black,” he said before joining the river of people leaving St. Peter’s Square. “We’ll be back tomorrow morning,” he added. “Same spot.” People are filing out of the square, tired but in good spirits. “That spirit of just being together for three hours was quite beautiful,” said Father Francis Wambua, a priest from Machakos, Kenya, who is studying in Rome. He said he’ll be back tomorrow. José and Marisol Rodríguez, who traveled from Florida to experience the conclave, were mulling how late to stay in St. Peter’s Square when the black smoke came out of the chimney. They were happy to get a break for the night, especially since they had been present during the cardinals’ Mass in the morning. They plan to return Thursday and hope to see Cardinal Pizzaballa elected pope.The black smoke from the Vatican chimney confirms that the 133 cardinals did not reach a two-thirds majority needed to elect a pope on their first vote, and that they will have to meet and vote again in the morning.

It will release a plume of white smoke if a pope has been chosen, and black smoke if no candidate has won the required two-thirds majority of votes.It’s a tradition that scholars date to the 19th century, when conclaves were held at the Quirinale Palace, the papal palace across town that is now home to the Italian president.In “Behind Locked Doors,” a 2003 history of papal elections, Frederic J. Baumgartner wrote that the first evidence he found of smoke being used as a signal in a papal election was from 1823. The cardinals’ ballots were burned in previous conclaves, he wrote, but there was no record that the smoke was intended to inform the outside world of a new pope.The smoke comes from the burning of the ballots, as well as any notes that the cardinals have taken, which are placed in a cast-iron stove after each round of voting. (One round is held the first day, and four each day from then on, with two in the morning and two in the afternoon.) The ballots are burned after two rounds of voting, unless a pope is chosen.Until this century, wet straw was added to the stove to create the smoke’s white color. But it wasn’t always reliable.As The New York Times reported, during the 1958 conclave, white smoke seemed to appear twice during the second day of voting. That created confusion because, in fact, a pope had not yet been selected.A Times reporter described the frenzy outside St. Peter’s: “Dozens of newspapermen in the square made a dash for the nearest telephone,” and guests at a wedding inside the basilica dashed outside, “leaving the bride and bridegroom alone in front of a priest at the altar.”But it was a false alarm. The confusion in that conclave, which elected Pope John XXIII, led to conspiracy theories that another cardinal had been the real winner.In 1978, cartridges were first used to enhance the black or the white color of the smoke during the conclave that elected John Paul I. When he died suddenly 33 days after he was elected, the cartridges were used again in the election that year of his successor, John Paul II.ImageWhite smoke announcing that a new pope had been elected in 2013.Credit...Gregorio Borgia/Associated PressThat method was also imperfect science. In the case of John Paul I, an amusing video from the time shows befuddled reporters panicking as white smoke from the chimney turns black. “You can’t understand anything,” one frazzled reporter screams into a telephone. The Vatican later announced that a pope had been elected.By 2005, when John Paul II died, a more reliable system was devised that remains in use today. An electronic control unit resembling a stove is now placed alongside the cast-iron stove — they share a chimney flue — to burn cartridges that color the smoke from the ballots.Massimiliano De Sanctis, a fireworks expert, customized one of his fireworks machines for the Vatican, and it was used for the 2005 conclave that elected Benedict XVI and the 2013 conclave that elected Francis.“We didn’t invent anything new,” he said in an interview. “It’s the system used for fireworks.”The black or white smoke cartridges are placed in the unit, and when the ballots are burned in the cast-iron stove, a cardinal presses a button to set off the cartridges in the unit, coloring the smoke. For each vote, six cartridges are used, and the smoke lasts about seven minutes, Mr. De Sanctis said.After the confusion of the past, the Vatican doesn’t take chances: Once white smoke comes out of the chimney, bells will begin pealing from St. Peter’s Basilica, calling other churches in Rome to ring their bells as well.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTA sea gull took center stage at the last conclave.ImageA sea gull on the chimney atop the Sistine Chapel.Credit...Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesA solitary chimney above the Sistine Chapel will soon be the most watched object in the world.After each round of voting during the conclave to choose a new pope, the ballots are burned, and a glimpse at the chimney atop the Vatican signals the results. White smoke signifies that a new pope has been elected. Black smoke means more voting is needed. A sea gull sitting on the chimney means … wait, what now?During the last conclave in 2013, as millions focused their gaze on the roof of the Sistine Chapel, a sea gull landed on the chimney’s metal cover at an opportune moment.Was it a symbol? A blessing? A sign? Would the white bird signify white smoke?“That seagull on the Sistine Chapel roof by the conclave is great product placement for the Holy Spirit,” James Martin, a Jesuit priest, posted on Twitter at the time.The sea gull quickly became the most famous bird in the world. A social media account aptly named the Sistine Seagull was created almost immediately.“I can see them voting from up here, btw,” the account posted on Twitter, using an abbreviation for “by the way.” “Anybody has any questions, just ask.”The sea gull remained on the chimney for about 40 minutes.About an hour after the bird flew away, white smoke emerged from the chimney. Pope Francis had been chosen.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe Sistine Chapel becomes the world’s most beautiful polling place.ImageInside the Sistine Chapel.Credit...Andreas Solaro/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesCardinals are voting inside the Sistine Chapel beneath frescoes painted by Renaissance masters, a vaulted ceiling decorated by Michelangelo that is a landmark of Western art and his powerful “Last Judgment” on the eastern wall.It may be the world’s most beautiful polling place. Already internationally renowned, it is now “at the center of the attention of the world,” Barbara Jatta, the director of the Vatican Museums, told reporters on Tuesday.The Sistine Chapel is named after Sixtus IV, who became pope in 1471 and commissioned its construction as the primary chapel of the papal court. It has been posited, though there are skeptics, that the chapel’s dimensions — 131 feet by 42 feet, with ceilings 65 feet high — were meant to recall the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem as described in the Old Testament, Ms. Jatta said.ImageDetail of the ceiling.Credit...Fotopress/Getty ImagesBetween 1481 and 1483, Sixtus hired some of the greatest artists of the time — Perugino, Botticelli, Signorelli and Ghirlandaio — to fresco the walls of the chapel, which Ms. Jatta said is “symbolic of our faith, our art and our history.” The frescos depict scenes from the lives of Jesus Christ and Moses.When Julius II, the nephew of Pope Sixtus IV, became pope in 1503, he began an ambitious building program that included revamping St. Peter’s Basilica and completing the Sistine Chapel.In 1508, he brought in Michelangelo to paint the Sistine’s vault, replacing a previous fresco depicting a starry sky. Working alone on a platform and craning his neck while standing, as a sketched self-portrait shows, Michelangelo painted nine scenes from the Old Testament’s Book of Genesis, and nude figures (known as ignudi), prophets and sybils. It took him four years.Michelangelo later received a commission from Pope Clement VII to paint the wall behind the altar with a rendering of the Last Judgment. In his biography of Michelangelo, Giorgio Vasari wrote that Clement VII had wanted him to paint the work “so that he could demonstrate in this scene all that the art of design was capable of achieving.”Image“The Last Judgment” by Michelangelo.Credit...Fine Art Images/Heritage Images, via Getty ImagesMichelangelo hadn’t been thrilled by the gig. He considered himself a sculptor first and foremost, “but the pope called him and he was a faithful person,” said Ralf van Bühren, who teaches art history at the Santa Croce Pontifical University in Rome. In “The Last Judgment,” Michelangelo depicted a self-portrait in the skin of flayed St. Bartholomew, to show “he suffered so much, he didn’t like to paint,” he said.Not everyone was enthusiastic about “The Last Judgment,” with some clerics complaining that too many figures were nude. But Paul III, who became pope in 1534, was a fan. It is said that he fell on his knees, his eyes filling with tears, when the fresco was unveiled in 1541.Some believe the art will serve as inspiration to the cardinal electors as they gather beneath the frescoes.“The contemplation of these images evokes the spiritual responsibility of their vote,” Ms. Jatta said.ImageThe Sistine Chapel has been temporarily closed to tourists during the process of picking a new pope.Credit...Dimitar Dilkoff/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesFor the conclave, carpenters built a raised, beige-carpeted platform about two feet above the original floor so that it will be level with the second step leading to the altar. Running the length of the chapel are long tables where the cardinals will sit on cherry wood chairs marked with their names.The Sistine Chapel has been temporarily closed for days, disappointing tourists who may have planned to visit before Pope Francis’ death on April 21 set the succession process in motion.Last year, about 7 million visitors trooped through the Sistine Chapel, Ms. Jatta said. The chapel is “hyper monitored” with sensors, she said, and equipped with special lighting and an energy efficient air-conditioning system to minimize wear and tear on the space.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHow does the voting work?ImageCardinals gathered for a Mass before the start of the conclave on Wednesday.Credit...Dimitar Dilkoff/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesCasting ballots for pope is a carefully laid out ritual.According to established rules, lots are drawn to select nine cardinals who will have a role in the election. They are divided into three groups:Scrutineers: Three cardinals who oversee the entire process.Infirmarii: Three cardinals who collect the votes of any electors who are sick (though none was believed to be ill as of Wednesday).Revisers: Three cardinals who double-check the ballots at the end of each round of voting.The cardinals, sitting at long tables inside the Sistine Chapel, each receive rectangular pieces of paper printed with the Latin phrase “Eligo in Summum Pontificem,” or, “I elect as the supreme pontiff.” Beneath that, they write the name of their choice for pope.The 1996 conclave rules specify that the vote must be secret and the candidate’s name legible, “taking care not to write other names as well, since this would make the ballot null.” One by one, the cardinals walk with their ballot toward the chapel’s altar. Facing the eastern wall, which is decorated with Michelangelo’s “The Last Judgment,” each cardinal utters an oath, in Latin: “I call as my witness Christ the Lord who will be my judge, that my vote is given to the one who before God I think should be elected.”Then the cardinal places the ballot on a plate and slides it into an urn, traditionally a large chalice.After all the cardinals have voted, one of the scrutineers mixes the ballots by shaking the chalice. Then the votes are counted individually and placed into a second container. The number of ballots and voters have to match; otherwise, the vote is void.The ballots are then opened and read by all three scrutineers. The third one announces the name out loud, and records it.Once the votes have been tallied, a scrutineer pierces each ballot with a needle and threads them together with a red string. After the revisers check the count, the ballots are burned.Except for the first day, when there is only one vote, two votes take place every morning and two every afternoon, until two-thirds of the cardinals agree on the choice.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\\n```\\n\\n## [These 10 U.S. Cardinals Have a Vote in Selecting the Next Pope](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/world/europe/us-cardinals-pope-vote-conclave.html) (#47009)\\n\\n> 2025-05-07 14:32:34+00:00\\n\\n```\\nAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTYou have a preview view of this article while we are checking your access.

Cupich of Chicago.Credit...Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York TimesMay 7, 2025The College of Cardinals includes 17 members from the United States. But only 10 of those are cardinal electors, meaning that they are allowed to participate in the conclave and vote for the next pope. The other seven are older than 80, the cutoff to be an elector.Six of the 10 cardinals were elevated to the position by Pope Francis and are largely known as vocal supporters of his priorities, particularly on immigration, the environment and poverty. This will be their first conclave:Cardinal Blase J. Cupich of Chicago, 76. Born in Nebraska, he was a bishop in South Dakota and an archbishop in Spokane, Wash. His appointment to Chicago in 2014 was one of Pope Francis’ early moves to reshape U.S. church leadership, particularly to show support for immigrants. Cardinal Cupich’s archdiocese covers about two million Catholics in Cook and Lake Counties.Cardinal Robert W. McElroy of Washington, 71. The former bishop of San Diego is known for regularly speaking out on behalf of migrants, women and L.G.B.T.Q. people in the church and the United States. He has said that the Trump administration’s plans for a “wider, indiscriminate, massive deportation across the country” would be “incompatible with Catholic doctrine.”Cardinal Joseph W. Tobin of Newark, 73. Before coming to Newark, he led the archdiocese of Indianapolis (where he bench-pressed 225 pounds at the gym). As a young priest, he ministered to people with AIDS in Chicago. He has said that he does not see “a compelling theological reason why the pope couldn’t name a woman cardinal.”Cardinal Wilton D. Gregory, archbishop emeritus of Washington, 77. The first African-American cardinal, he was president of the United States Catholic bishops’ conference in 2002 and pushed to pass the Dallas Charter, which instituted a zero-tolerance policy for sexual abuse of minors. Later the archbishop of Atlanta, he supported L.G.B.T.Q. Catholics and commissioned an action plan after Francis’ encyclical on the environment.Cardinal Kevin J. Farrell, prefect of the Dicastery for the Laity, the Family and Life, 77. The Irish-American was formerly bishop of Dallas. Pope Francis made him the camerlengo, or chamberlain, the Vatican’s acting administrator when a pope dies or resigns. He was responsible for verifying Pope Francis’ death.Cardinal Robert F. Prevost, prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops, 69. A Chicago-born priest, he advised the pope on bishop appointments around the world. He is also a member of the Order of Saint Augustine, a religious order of men and women who follow the teachings of the fourth-century saint. Cardinal Prevost is also seen by some as a contender for pope, though a long shot. (There has never been an American pontiff.)Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

The cardinals, the most ever to gather in a papal conclave, will retire to guest quarters at the Vatican and return on Thursday morning to continue voting. They will remain isolated during their deliberations, without phone or internet access and under oaths of total secrecy, until a two-thirds majority agrees on a candidate.The first conclave in more than a decade, a little more than two weeks after Pope Francis’ death set in motion the process of choosing his successor, comes during an uncertain time for the church, which is facing difficult decisions about its future direction, strained finances and a reckoning over past sexual abuse scandals.After a morning Mass, the conclave began as the cardinals, all men and nearly all over age 50, filed in a solemn procession into the Sistine Chapel, where they took assigned seats at long wooden tables under the soaring frescoes of Renaissance masters.The papal election is one of the world’s oldest dramas, but this one is unlike any before it, with many cardinals appointed by Francis meeting one another for the first time. The new faces bring unfamiliar politics, priorities and concerns that some experts say could make the selection process more fragmented than usual. Francis also left the church deeply divided, with progressive factions pushing for more inclusion and change and conservatives seeking to roll things back, often under the guise of preserving unity.Here’s what to know:How it works: The cardinals will participate in four rounds of voting every day until a candidate achieves a two-thirds majority. The ballots are burned after two rounds of voting, and the smoke above the Sistine Chapel signals whether a decision has been made — black smoke for no decision, white if there is a pope. There is no indication of how long it will take, though the last two conclaves reached decisions within two days.Possible successors: Predicting the outcome of a papal election is always challenging, but oddsmakers say that two top contenders are Cardinal Pietro Parolin of Italy, who was Francis’ second-in-command, and Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of the Philippines, a country where the church is growing rapidly.Referendum on Francis: The election in many ways will turn on whether the cardinals want a pope who will follow Francis’ path of openness and inclusion or forge a different one. During his 12-year pontificate, Francis made global headlines for landmark declarations that encouraged liberals, including allowing the blessing of people in same-sex unions and raising his voice for migrants.Test your knowledge: How well do you know the process of selecting a pope?

All 133 voting cardinals must write the name of the man he sees as pope on a rectangular piece of paper under the phrase “Eligo in Summum Pontificem,” or “I elect as the supreme pontiff.” Cardinals individually walk their ballots to the chapel’s altar, where they say an oath in Latin, and leave the ballot on a plate.Votes are counted before being read aloud and pierced and tied together with a red string (the “Conclave” film depicted this practice). After ballots are counted, they are burned.Smoke emerges from the Sistine Chapel up to twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Black smoke tells the world that the cardinals haven’t reached a decision; white smoke announces that a new pope has been chosen.Both of the past two popes — Benedict XVI in 2005 and Francis in 2013 — were elected in two days. For the past two centuries, each pope was selected within four days or fewer.The cardinal electors will take Sunday off for prayer if a pope has not been selected by Saturday afternoon.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMay 7, 2025, 4:24 p.m. ETMay 7, 2025Paper ballots and sacred oaths: the objects guiding the conclave.From left, wooden balls with numbers corresponding to each cardinal elector; papal vestments that the new pope will don; and the doors of the Apostolic Palace, which are closed with the Pontifical Swiss Guard seal.The conclave to elect the next pope is now underway at the Vatican. The cardinals — the prelates who are just below the pope in the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy — will vote by secret ballot for a successor to Pope Francis until one candidate earns a two-thirds majority.While we may not know what’s being said during the conclave — it is off limits to outsiders — we do have a pretty good idea what it will look like. During the gathering, the cardinals will follow specific instructions and use several distinctive objects to facilitate the process, many steeped in tradition.Here’s a look at some of those objects, and the meaning behind them.Voting InstrumentsWhen the cardinals vote in the Sistine Chapel, they will be sitting in rows of simple wooden tables. At one end of the chapel, a large table is set up for those who run the voting, according to the Universi Dominici Gregis, or U.D.G., one of the documents used to govern the papal transition.The room also contains voting instruments, including an urn to receive the ballots, a set of wooden balls, and a needle and twine. The urn is used to collect the ballots, rectangular pieces of paper printed with the Latin phrase “Eligo in Summum Pontificem” (“I elect as Supreme Pontiff”).The ballots contain a space where each cardinal writes in the name of his chosen candidate. The ballots are placed in the urn and are removed for counting after all the cardinals have voted.The wooden balls are used to keep track of the ballots. The balls have numbers written on them that correspond to the number of cardinals voting in the conclave. As the ballots are being counted, an attendant removes one of the wooden balls for each ballot, to ensure that the number matches the number of cardinals, according to The Catholic Advocate, formerly a newspaper of the Archdiocese of Newark, N.J. If the numbers don’t match, the ballots must be burned without being read and another vote is conducted immediately, according to the U.D.G.As the ballots are being read, they are pierced with the needle through the word “Eligo” and strung onto the thread, “so that the ballots can be more securely preserved,” according to the U.D.G.ImageMembers of the clergy and conclave staff taking the oath of secrecy in the Pauline Chapel earlier this week.Credit...The VaticanThe Oath of SecrecyThe conclave is a secretive institution, and many steps are taken to prevent leaks, including restricting the cardinals’ use of phones, the internet and newspapers.The members of the College of Cardinals, the body that will elect the pope, must also swear and sign an oath of secrecy, according to the U.D.G. The oath reads, in part: “I will observe absolute and perpetual secrecy with all who are not part of the College of Cardinal electors concerning all matters directly or indirectly related to the ballots cast and their scrutiny for the election of the Supreme Pontiff.”The cardinals also must promise not to record anything in Vatican City during the time of the election. The punishment for breaking the oath is “automatic” excommunication, according to the oath.ImageA temporary stove in the Sistine Chapel in a photo provided by the Vatican.Credit...The VaticanThe StoveThe weekend before the conclave began, Vatican workers installed a simple stove in which ballots would be burned in the Sistine Chapel. Fire crews also installed a chimney on the roof of the chapel, where the smoke will leave the building.After each round of voting, the ballots are mixed with chemicals that, when burned, emit either black or white smoke. Black smoke means that the cardinals have not yet reached the requisite majority; white smoke means that a new pope has been elected and voting is over.The SealAt the beginning of the conclave, the Apostolic Palace, which contains the Sistine Chapel, is closed to the public. On Wednesday, members of the Pontifical Swiss Guard placed beaded ropes with the guard’s seal at the entrances to the palace to ensure privacy and maintain secrecy for the cardinals.The Vatican City government also planned to deactivate cellphone service within its territory for the duration of the conclave, starting on Wednesday afternoon.The Papal VestmentsAfter a pope is elected, he is taken to the “Room of Tears,” a small room next to the Sistine Chapel, where he will put on the white papal cassock for the first time. Garments in three sizes are prepared and kept in the room, since no one knows who — or what size — the next pope will be.The room is known as the “Room of Tears” because there are accounts of previous popes becoming overwhelmed with emotion in the room, and being moved to tears, after their election. After the pope puts on the vestments, he is introduced to the public for the first time.May 7, 2025, 4:01 p.m. ETMay 7, 2025The faithful and the curious gather in St. Peter’s Square.ImageThe crowd in St. Peter’s Square reacts to the black smoke emanating from a Vatican chimney, indicating no decision has been made on a new pope. Credit...Eloisa Lopez/ReutersAfter the men who will select the next pope were locked inside the Sistine Chapel without cellphones on Wednesday, the only thing left to do was wait for them to send a signal to the outside world. By smoke.The highly secret voting began inside what is possibly one of the world’s most secure vaults in the early evening, with the 133 cardinals tasked with deciding who will succeed Pope Francis writing candidates’ names on voting cards by hand, trying to disguise their handwriting.Outside in St. Peter’s Square, thousands of the faithful, the curious and the vacationing gathered to await the news of whether the cardinals had managed to elect a papal successor. Word came at 9 p.m., in the form of black smoke billowing from a chimney installed last week on the roof of the chapel.If the smoke had been white, it would have meant that the cardinals had chosen the first new pope in a dozen years in just one round of voting, a feat not seen for centuries.But the black smoke, created when the cardinals’ ballots are incinerated in a cast-iron stove, means they’ll have to try again.“We are cold, we’re hungry, we’re thirsty but yet we can’t move,” said the Rev. Peter Mangum, 61, a priest at the Church of Jesus the Good Shepherd in Monroe, La. He and three other priests had been in the square for about seven hours, and it was Father Mangum’s fourth time waiting for news of a new pope.He had stood in the same spot for the elections of John Paul II, Benedict XVI and Francis, and he wasn’t going to budge until he knew Wednesday’s news. “We had to make sure the smoke was black,” he said.ImageThe black smoke flowing out from the Sistine Chapel on Wednesday night. Credit...Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesIt took two days to elect Pope Francis in 2013 and Benedict XVI in 2005. No conclave in the 20th or 21st centuries has lasted more than five days.In an era when news travels instantly around the world, the patience-requiring wait for the smoke in St. Peter’s Square is a ritual that dates back to the 19th century.For some, the anxiety was intense. “I think there’s more nervousness among the people outside than among the cardinals themselves,” said Tania Radesca, who arrived at the square at 1 p.m.Ms. Radesca, who is from Venezuela, had volunteered to help during the Jubilee, a year of pilgrimage that happens every 25 years, and she arrived in Rome just over a month ago. She was in St. Peter’s Square on Easter Sunday and caught a final glimpse of Pope Francis in his popemobile.He died a day later.Those who arrived early to score spots at the barricades closest to the front of St. Peter’s Basilica draped flags from their home countries along the barriers and befriended each other as they settled in. Others camped out on yoga mats or picnic blankets.ImageNuns praying at St. Peter’s Square as the conclave to elect the next pope gets underway, at the Vatican on Wednesday.Credit...Jeff Pachoud/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesMany had traveled a long way, specifically for the conclave. Rodrigo Pinto, 43, a retired karate instructor, flew 23 hours from Guatemala, landing on Tuesday afternoon and heading straight to St. Peter’s Square on Wednesday so he could wait for the first sign of smoke.Mr. Pinto, who was wearing a rosary, said,“I want to be a part of something I have always seen on TV, in documentaries, on the internet.” After standing in the rain in the morning and under the hot sun in the afternoon, he said, “Three hours ago, it was like hell. Sorry, St. Peter.”In a post office inside the square, Jennifer Raulli, 54, wrote postcards to her college-age children in the United States. She was in Rome on vacation with one of her daughters, who just graduated from Texas Christian University, and had gotten tickets to see Pope Francis say Mass on Wednesday. Instead, they arrived at the square to wait for the smoke that might herald the man who replaces him.“It is going to be a long couple of hours, but I would not miss it,” said Ms. Raulli, who had traveled from Pasadena, Calif. Ms. Raulli, who was raised Presbyterian and converted to Catholicism when she was 37, said she would prefer a “more conservative” pope because she would like the church to be “less politicized” and close to her vision of biblical teachings. The day of waiting began at 10 a.m. when Giovanni Battista Re, the spry, 91-year-old dean of the College of Cardinals, presided over a Mass inside St. Peter’s Basilica and implored the voting cardinals to choose “a pope who knows how best to awaken the consciences of all, and the moral and spiritual energies in today’s society.”As the cardinals gave each other the sign of peace during the service, Cardinal Re hugged Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican secretary of state under Francis and considered a leading candidate to succeed him. A microphone caught Cardinal Re wishing Cardinal Parolin best wishes.Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, another potential candidate who appeared with a fresh haircut, warmly shook his peers’ hands. Cardinal Jean-Marc Aveline, the archbishop of Marseille and also considered a papal contender, stopped for a prayer in front of the reliquary containing the remains of Pope John XXIII — a hero to many liberal Catholics for his efforts to modernize the church.ImageItalian cardinal Matteo Maria Zuppi, right, attends a Mass before the start of the conclave, at St. Peter’s Basilica in The Vatican.Credit...Dimitar Dilkoff/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesAfter lunch at the Casa Santa Marta, the lodging house inside the Vatican where the electors will stay throughout the conclave, the cardinals walked to the Sistine Chapel. As they proceeded into the chapel, they chanted the Litany of the Saints, while a choir hauntingly invoked the names of the saints. The cardinals replied with “Ora pro nobis,” or “Pray for us.” Outside in the square, many watching on the large video screens flanking the basilica swayed and echoed the cardinals’ chant.Inside the Sistine Chapel, name tags for the cardinals had been placed on the long tables where they would vote. Francis named many more cardinals than his two predecessors, some from countries far from the Vatican, and many of the papal electors — and potential popes — do not know one another.Around 5:45 p.m., Archbishop Diego Giovanni Ravelli, the master of pontifical liturgical celebrations, announced “extra omnes,” a Latin phrase that means “everybody out.” The giant wooden doors were closed, leaving the 133 cardinal electors — those under the age of 80 who can vote in the secret ballot — locked inside.ImageThe crowd in St. Peter’s Square watching a giant video screen displaying images of Diego Giovanni Ravelli, the master of pontifical liturgical celebrations, closing the doors of the Sistine Chapel.Credit...Andreas Solaro/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe cardinals will not be allowed to leave the Vatican until a two-thirds majority agrees on the next pope. Phones, internet, television and any contact from outside the Vatican walls are prohibited, a custom enforced to discourage the process from dragging on.Some veteran electors believed there would be prolonged voting. “Bring a book,” Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan of New York said he advised other cardinals, in an interview on Tuesday. The conclave began 16 days after Francis’ death on April 21. The significance of the moment was not lost even on those who had little knowledge of Catholicism.Yuichiro Yamakoshi, 41, a Japanese tourist traveling with his wife, said that after touring the Vatican museums and walking through the doors of the four main basilicas that are usually open only during the Jubilee, he started to understand the power and influence of the faith. Although the couple had come to St. Peter’s Square on Tuesday with a guide, they returned on Wednesday morning for a commemorative photo marking the conclave.As the black smoke dissipated into the sky, all there was to do was wait for another day.Of all the people coincidentally in Rome for the start of the papal conclave on Wednesday, the pilgrims from St. Cecilia Catholic Church in Houston may have had among the most poignant stories. The 47 faithful who had traveled with their priest — also coincidentally named Francis — to Rome this week had scheduled a meeting with Pope Francis on Wednesday. Instead, they were in St. Peter’s Square during the final Mass before the conclave beginning later in the day.One of the group, George Smith, 69, said, “It is a blessing for us.”As a river of people streamed out of the square, a group of Romans who had been convinced the smoke would be white shook hands and hugged. “See you tomorrow!” they said.ImageThe densely packed crowd in St. Peter’s Square on Wednesday night.Credit...Andrej Isakovic/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesReporting was contributed by Emma Bubola, Elisabetta Povoledo, Jason Horowitz, Elizabeth Dias, Matthew Mpoke Bigg, Bernhard Warner and Josephine de La Bruyère.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMay 7, 2025, 3:56 p.m. ETMay 7, 2025Survivors call on the next pope to end sexual abuse by clergy.ImageThe Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests is one of several survivors groups to have arrived in Rome since Pope Francis died.Credit...Andrew Medichini/Associated PressAs cardinals prepared to enter the Sistine Chapel on Wednesday afternoon to elect a pope, groups representing survivors of sexual abuse by priests made last-minute appeals for the next pontiff to definitively resolve the crisis, which has shadowed the Roman Catholic Church for decades.The best way forward, the groups said, was to impose a zero-tolerance policy on transgressors and those who covered up for them, and for church leaders to own up to their own mishandling of abuse cases.“We want to work with the next pope to put an end to clerical abuse,” Peter Isely, a member of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, known as SNAP, said Wednesday at a news conference.In March, the group launched a website tracking each cardinal’s record in dealing with credible allegations against priests under his watch. Few in the upper echelons of the church’s hierarchy are without blame, the group claimed.On Friday, Matteo Bruni, the Vatican spokesman, said the cardinals had discussed sexual abuse in the run-up to the conclave and considered it a “wound to be kept open” so awareness of the problem remained alive and solutions could be identified.SNAP also presented a road map for the pope’s first 100 days, describing steps its members think he should take to resolve the crisis.SNAP is only one of several survivors groups to have arrived in Rome since Pope Francis died on April 21, hoping their message will resonate with the cardinals.One international group, Ending Clergy Abuse, or ECA, echoed Martin Luther’s radical 1517 call for church reform on Tuesday evening when it brought a manifesto — titled the 95 Theses of Survivors — to the front door of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Vatican office that handles most abuse cases. They did not nail it to the door, but tried to slip it between the doors.“I rang the doorbell but they didn’t answer,” said Gemma Hickey, the president of ECA, who is a survivor of abuse. It was not until they started reading the document out loud that the door opened and an official took it. “He didn’t say anything, but it was received, so I was happy with that, even if it was just symbolic.”Francesco Zanardi, the founder of Rete L’Abuso, Italy’s largest survivors’ group, said at a news conference on Tuesday that the church laws promoted by Pope Francis to guide bishops in handling abuse were often thwarted in Italy because national laws do not force bishops to report cases of abuse to law enforcement officials.Speaking out against clerical abuse is not always without consequence. Ann Hagan Webb and Anne Barrett Doyle, of BishopAccountability.org, an archive and advocacy group, said the police stopped them when they were walking near the Vatican office that handles abuse cases holding photos of two cardinals whose records on punishing abusers have drawn scrutiny.“They told us we couldn’t carry signs,” Ms. Barrett Doyle said. The police officers took photos of their documents and called other police officers before letting them go after about 45 minutes. “At least they didn’t arrest us,” she said.Under Pope Francis, the Vatican took decidedly stronger steps than it had in the past to counter sexual abuse.Francis issued the church’s most comprehensive law yet to hold clerics accountable if they sexually abused children or vulnerable adults, or if they covered up abuse. And he apologized to survivors on many occasions, acknowledging their pain. But critics have said that the measures were not enough and often were not applied because of resistance within the church.May 7, 2025, 3:33 p.m. ETMay 7, 2025Come for the conclave, not for the food.ImagePope Francis having lunch at the Vatican in 2018. His emphasis on simple living and humility extended to the food he ate.Credit...Vincenzo Pinto/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe cardinals gathering for the conclave hope to pick the very best among them to be the leader of the Roman Catholic Church. Their culinary expectations are not so high.“Food you could eat at a train station” was how Cardinal Mauro Piacenza, a conclave veteran from the Italian city of Genoa, famous for its pesto, described the fare at the Casa Santa Marta, a guesthouse in the Vatican where the cardinals will be staying during the conclave. By train station food, he said he meant pastas with “watery sauce,” simple cutlets and salads: “Not exciting.”The ambience at Santa Marta isn’t much of a draw, either. Its cafeteria has pale green columns, utilitarian furniture and fan art in the hallway depicting Francis as a Jedi knight in “Star Wars.” But priests would angle for a reservation there because Santa Marta was the home of Pope Francis. Until he began ailing and taking his meals in his room, the pope often ate in the cafeteria at a table between the window and the refrigerator.Among the residents of the guesthouse, Francis, with his emphasis on simple living and humility, bore some blame for the decline in the food. Some lamented bland vegetables, less-than-rich pastas and leftovers from gifts to the pope — a box of dates from the Middle East, for example.Across the ideological spectrum, a consensus emerged.“You don’t eat very well,” said Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi of Italy, a supporter of Pope Francis.“It’s not so good,” said Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller of Germany, who was fired by Francis.The food at the conclave isn’t supposed to be good.The tradition of locking in the cardinals began in the 13th century, after residents of Viterbo, a town north of Rome where the election was being held, grew so frustrated with the process, which was taking years, that they ripped the roof off the building where the cardinals were meeting and reduced the menu to bread and water. The pope who came out of that election, Gregory X, decreed in 1274 that after three days of conclave, cardinals would get only one meal a day. The more days they took, the less food they got.But election menus improved. Centuries later, conclave food deliveries were inspected for secret messages — easily stuffable pies and chickens were verboten — and passed to the cardinals through a revolving door.When a 16th-century cardinal died during a conclave, some others claimed the food was poisoned. In the conclave that lasted from November 1549 to February 1550, the famed Vatican cook Bartolomeo Scappi noted that cardinals took turns acting as poison testers. Once it was clear the food was safe, they drank from carafes of wine and ate from hampers full of food.Scappi doesn’t say exactly what he fed them, but Crystal King, the author of a novel about the chef, wrote that her research led her to conclude they ate “ravioli and rabbit pappardelle” and “cheesy breads, veal croquettes, roasted bear, grilled beef ribs, open-faced mushroom crostatas, pheasant in red-currant sauce and maybe even caviar omelets.”Times have changed, and though Santa Marta is not exactly serving bread and water, the cardinals preparing to vote for the next pope know not to bring their appetites.“We will eat whatever they give us,” Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo Besungu of Congo said on Sunday. When told by a reporter about a subpar dining experience at the Santa Marta mess hall, he joked, “And you’re not dead.” He said that one had to have “trust in the Holy Spirit.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMay 7, 2025, 3:21 p.m. ETMay 7, 2025Father Peter Mangum, of Monroe, La, waited for three hours in the same spot he had stood when the cardinals selected John Paul II, Benedict XVI and Francis. “We had to make sure the smoke was black,” he said before joining the river of people leaving St. Peter’s Square. “We’ll be back tomorrow morning,” he added. “Same spot.” May 7, 2025, 3:17 p.m. ETMay 7, 2025People are filing out of the square, tired but in good spirits. “That spirit of just being together for three hours was quite beautiful,” said Father Francis Wambua, a priest from Machakos, Kenya, who is studying in Rome.

It will release a plume of white smoke if a pope has been chosen, and black smoke if no candidate has won the required two-thirds majority of votes.It’s a tradition that scholars date to the 19th century, when conclaves were held at the Quirinale Palace, the papal palace across town that is now home to the Italian president.In “Behind Locked Doors,” a 2003 history of papal elections, Frederic J. Baumgartner wrote that the first evidence he found of smoke being used as a signal in a papal election was from 1823. The cardinals’ ballots were burned in previous conclaves, he wrote, but there was no record that the smoke was intended to inform the outside world of a new pope.The smoke comes from the burning of the ballots, as well as any notes that the cardinals have taken, which are placed in a cast-iron stove after each round of voting. (One round is held the first day, and four each day from then on, with two in the morning and two in the afternoon.) The ballots are burned after two rounds of voting, unless a pope is chosen.Until this century, wet straw was added to the stove to create the smoke’s white color. But it wasn’t always reliable.As The New York Times reported, during the 1958 conclave, white smoke seemed to appear twice during the second day of voting. That created confusion because, in fact, a pope had not yet been selected.A Times reporter described the frenzy outside St. Peter’s: “Dozens of newspapermen in the square made a dash for the nearest telephone,” and guests at a wedding inside the basilica dashed outside, “leaving the bride and bridegroom alone in front of a priest at the altar.”But it was a false alarm. The confusion in that conclave, which elected Pope John XXIII, led to conspiracy theories that another cardinal had been the real winner.In 1978, cartridges were first used to enhance the black or the white color of the smoke during the conclave that elected John Paul I. When he died suddenly 33 days after he was elected, the cartridges were used again in the election that year of his successor, John Paul II.ImageWhite smoke announcing that a new pope had been elected in 2013.Credit...Gregorio Borgia/Associated PressThat method was also imperfect science. In the case of John Paul I, an amusing video from the time shows befuddled reporters panicking as white smoke from the chimney turns black. “You can’t understand anything,” one frazzled reporter screams into a telephone. The Vatican later announced that a pope had been elected.By 2005, when John Paul II died, a more reliable system was devised that remains in use today. An electronic control unit resembling a stove is now placed alongside the cast-iron stove — they share a chimney flue — to burn cartridges that color the smoke from the ballots.Massimiliano De Sanctis, a fireworks expert, customized one of his fireworks machines for the Vatican, and it was used for the 2005 conclave that elected Benedict XVI and the 2013 conclave that elected Francis.“We didn’t invent anything new,” he said in an interview. “It’s the system used for fireworks.”The black or white smoke cartridges are placed in the unit, and when the ballots are burned in the cast-iron stove, a cardinal presses a button to set off the cartridges in the unit, coloring the smoke. For each vote, six cartridges are used, and the smoke lasts about seven minutes, Mr. De Sanctis said.After the confusion of the past, the Vatican doesn’t take chances: Once white smoke comes out of the chimney, bells will begin pealing from St. Peter’s Basilica, calling other churches in Rome to ring their bells as well.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMay 7, 2025, 12:44 p.m. ETMay 7, 2025A sea gull took center stage at the last conclave.ImageA sea gull on the chimney atop the Sistine Chapel.Credit...Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesA solitary chimney above the Sistine Chapel will soon be the most watched object in the world.After each round of voting during the conclave to choose a new pope, the ballots are burned, and a glimpse at the chimney atop the Vatican signals the results. White smoke signifies that a new pope has been elected. Black smoke means more voting is needed. A sea gull sitting on the chimney means … wait, what now?During the last conclave in 2013, as millions focused their gaze on the roof of the Sistine Chapel, a sea gull landed on the chimney’s metal cover at an opportune moment.Was it a symbol? A blessing? A sign? Would the white bird signify white smoke?“That seagull on the Sistine Chapel roof by the conclave is great product placement for the Holy Spirit,” James Martin, a Jesuit priest, posted on Twitter at the time.The sea gull quickly became the most famous bird in the world. A social media account aptly named the Sistine Seagull was created almost immediately.“I can see them voting from up here, btw,” the account posted on Twitter, using an abbreviation for “by the way.” “Anybody has any questions, just ask.”The sea gull remained on the chimney for about 40 minutes.About an hour after the bird flew away, white smoke emerged from the chimney.

Already internationally renowned, it is now “at the center of the attention of the world,” Barbara Jatta, the director of the Vatican Museums, told reporters on Tuesday.The Sistine Chapel is named after Sixtus IV, who became pope in 1471 and commissioned its construction as the primary chapel of the papal court. It has been posited, though there are skeptics, that the chapel’s dimensions — 131 feet by 42 feet, with ceilings 65 feet high — were meant to recall the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem as described in the Old Testament, Ms. Jatta said.ImageDetail of the ceiling.Credit...Fotopress/Getty ImagesBetween 1481 and 1483, Sixtus hired some of the greatest artists of the time — Perugino, Botticelli, Signorelli and Ghirlandaio — to fresco the walls of the chapel, which Ms. Jatta said is “symbolic of our faith, our art and our history.” The frescos depict scenes from the lives of Jesus Christ and Moses.When Julius II, the nephew of Pope Sixtus IV, became pope in 1503, he began an ambitious building program that included revamping St. Peter’s Basilica and completing the Sistine Chapel.In 1508, he brought in Michelangelo to paint the Sistine’s vault, replacing a previous fresco depicting a starry sky. Working alone on a platform and craning his neck while standing, as a sketched self-portrait shows, Michelangelo painted nine scenes from the Old Testament’s Book of Genesis, and nude figures (known as ignudi), prophets and sybils. It took him four years.Michelangelo later received a commission from Pope Clement VII to paint the wall behind the altar with a rendering of the Last Judgment. In his biography of Michelangelo, Giorgio Vasari wrote that Clement VII had wanted him to paint the work “so that he could demonstrate in this scene all that the art of design was capable of achieving.”Image“The Last Judgment” by Michelangelo.Credit...Fine Art Images/Heritage Images, via Getty ImagesMichelangelo hadn’t been thrilled by the gig. He considered himself a sculptor first and foremost, “but the pope called him and he was a faithful person,” said Ralf van Bühren, who teaches art history at the Santa Croce Pontifical University in Rome. In “The Last Judgment,” Michelangelo depicted a self-portrait in the skin of flayed St. Bartholomew, to show “he suffered so much, he didn’t like to paint,” he said.Not everyone was enthusiastic about “The Last Judgment,” with some clerics complaining that too many figures were nude. But Paul III, who became pope in 1534, was a fan. It is said that he fell on his knees, his eyes filling with tears, when the fresco was unveiled in 1541.Some believe the art will serve as inspiration to the cardinal electors as they gather beneath the frescoes.“The contemplation of these images evokes the spiritual responsibility of their vote,” Ms. Jatta said.ImageThe Sistine Chapel has been temporarily closed to tourists during the process of picking a new pope.Credit...Dimitar Dilkoff/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesFor the conclave, carpenters built a raised, beige-carpeted platform about two feet above the original floor so that it will be level with the second step leading to the altar. Running the length of the chapel are long tables where the cardinals will sit on cherry wood chairs marked with their names.The Sistine Chapel has been temporarily closed for days, disappointing tourists who may have planned to visit before Pope Francis’ death on April 21 set the succession process in motion.Last year, about 7 million visitors trooped through the Sistine Chapel, Ms. Jatta said. The chapel is “hyper monitored” with sensors, she said, and equipped with special lighting and an energy efficient air-conditioning system to minimize wear and tear on the space.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMay 7, 2025, 11:56 a.m. ETMay 7, 2025How does the voting work?ImageCardinals gathered for a Mass before the start of the conclave on Wednesday.Credit...Dimitar Dilkoff/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesCasting ballots for pope is a carefully laid out ritual.According to established rules, lots are drawn to select nine cardinals who will have a role in the election. They are divided into three groups:Scrutineers: Three cardinals who oversee the entire process.Infirmarii: Three cardinals who collect the votes of any electors who are sick (though none was believed to be ill as of Wednesday).Revisers: Three cardinals who double-check the ballots at the end of each round of voting.The cardinals, sitting at long tables inside the Sistine Chapel, each receive rectangular pieces of paper printed with the Latin phrase “Eligo in Summum Pontificem,” or, “I elect as the supreme pontiff.” Beneath that, they write the name of their choice for pope.The 1996 conclave rules specify that the vote must be secret and the candidate’s name legible, “taking care not to write other names as well, since this would make the ballot null.” One by one, the cardinals walk with their ballot toward the chapel’s altar. Facing the eastern wall, which is decorated with Michelangelo’s “The Last Judgment,” each cardinal utters an oath, in Latin: “I call as my witness Christ the Lord who will be my judge, that my vote is given to the one who before God I think should be elected.”Then the cardinal places the ballot on a plate and slides it into an urn, traditionally a large chalice.After all the cardinals have voted, one of the scrutineers mixes the ballots by shaking the chalice. Then the votes are counted individually and placed into a second container. The number of ballots and voters have to match; otherwise, the vote is void.The ballots are then opened and read by all three scrutineers. The third one announces the name out loud, and records it.Once the votes have been tallied, a scrutineer pierces each ballot with a needle and threads them together with a red string. After the revisers check the count, the ballots are burned.Except for the first day, when there is only one vote, two votes take place every morning and two every afternoon, until two-thirds of the cardinals agree on the choice.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMay 7, 2025, 8:13 a.m. ETMay 7, 2025A top cardinal asks for divine guidance at a ‘difficult’ moment in history.Video\\nAdvertisement\\nLIVE\\n00:00\\n0:37\\nPresiding over a Mass before the conclave, the dean of the College of Cardinals, Giovanni Battista Re, asked the cardinals to elect a pope whom “the church and humanity” need at a “difficult, complex and tormented” time.CreditCredit...Murad Sezer/ReutersThe first conclave rituals began on Wednesday morning, with dozens of cardinals and bishops attending a solemn Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica to invoke the Holy Spirit to help them pick the next pope.It was the last large public event the voting eminences were expected to attend before entering into seclusion and beginning to cast ballots in the Sistine Chapel on Wednesday afternoon.Giovanni Battista Re, the spry, 91-year-old dean of the College of Cardinals, presided over the Mass in the basilica built on the tomb of St. Peter, the Roman Catholic Church’s first pope. In his homily, Cardinal Re made a pitch to his peers to elect a pope “whom the church and humanity need at this difficult, complex and tormented turning point in history.”He also implored the voting cardinals to choose “a pope who knows how best to awaken the consciences of all, and the moral and spiritual energies in today’s society.” (Those words could offer a boost to more charismatic candidates.)The homily was not transparently political, but it also included some strong messages to the cardinals, such as a plea “to maintain the unity of the church.” Some liberals have worried that conservatives are campaigning to roll back Pope Francis’ agenda of inclusion under the guise of preserving unity. Cardinal Re added that Christ wanted “a unity that does not mean uniformity, but a firm and profound communion in diversity.”Cardinal Re cannot vote in the conclave because he is over 80, the cutoff age. He is nevertheless a veteran of conclaves and knows what it is like inside the Sistine Chapel during the election. In the homily, he talked about selflessness and Judas, the apostle who betrayed Christ, and urged the cardinals to set aside “personal considerations” as they make their decision.Quoting Pope John Paul II, Cardinal Re expressed hopes that Michelangelo’s painting of Jesus as the judge in the Sistine Chapel would “remind everyone of the great responsibility” of placing the papacy “in the correct hands.”Wearing bishop’s miters and red capes with golden embroidery, the cardinals proceeded over the marble floor of St. Peter’s central aisle as an organ played and Latin chants resounded in the basilica. An attendant asked the worshipers not to clap as the prelates entered.One playfully tapped another on the cheek. Several held canes.Cardinal Matteo Zuppi of Italy, who has emerged as a leading contender for pope — and who appeared to have a fresh haircut — warmly shook his peers’ hands.After Mass, the cardinals removed their capes and headed for lunch at Casa Santa Marta, the guesthouse where they will be staying until they elect a pope. Some carried tote bags.Cardinal Jean-Marc Aveline of France, who has also been mentioned as a papal contender, stopped for a prayer in front of the reliquary containing the remains of Pope John XXIII — a hero to many liberal Catholics for his efforts to modernize the church.\\n```\\n\\n## [Locals gather for red wine spritz and conclave watch in a cardinal\\'s hometown](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/locals-gather-red-wine-spritz-conclave-watch-cardinals-121585677) (#48311)\\n\\n> 2025-05-08 06:14:30+00:00\\n\\n```\\nSCHIAVON, Italy -- SCHIAVON, Italy (AP) — Conclave watching turned out to be a perfect aperitivo activity.Caffè Centrale, on the main drag of the Veneto hometown of Cardinal Pietro Parolin, a papal favorite, filled up with locals and journalists awaiting the first sign of smoke on Wednesday.A large TV screen displayed images from St. Peter’s Square and the chimney atop the Sistine Chapel, where 133 cardinals were casting the first votes for pope, as locals in the Veneto town of Schiavon, near Vicenza, quaffed glasses of wine.“We’re waiting, and we’re rooting for him,’’ said Giacomo Bonora, raising a glass of the local favorite, a red wine spritz, and using the local nickname for Parolin, “Don Piero.\" Bonora said that when Parolin returns to the town of 2,600, he asks to be called “Don Piero,\" the way a parish priest would be addressed, using the Veneto dialect for Pietro, rather than “eminence,\\'\\' a cardinal\\'s honorific.Parolin, 70, is a veteran diplomat who was Francis’ secretary of state, essentially the Holy See’s prime minister and No. 2 to the pope.Outside, a city worker stopped to show the parish sacristan a photo of Parolin when the town celebrated his elevation to secretary of state 12 years ago. Everyone is hopeful, but officials have been instructed not to speak to the media until a new pope is elected.Angelo Cisalto, the sacristan at the town\\'s St. Margherita parish church, was heading home to keep an eye on the smoke coming out of the chimney.If it is white, it is his job to go and ring the church bells. Cisalto, 84, remembers Parolin as a child, 14 years his junior, and always devout. “He used to dress up as an altar boy, and at home, in his garage, he had a little altar,’’ where he would play saying Mass, Cisalto recalled. “He is a very good, very humble person.\"Back at Caffè Centrale, clients ordered plates of cold cuts as the closed meeting of cardinals dragged on long past the expected hour. TV reporters whose air times had passed headed out for the night. Finally, black smoke emerged.“Tomorrow, we\\'ll do it again,” Bonora said. Locals recalled that Parolin came regularly to Schiavon before his mother died last summer. His father died when he was 10, and he entered the seminary in nearby Vicenza at 14. For a period, he was a parish priest in the foothills town of Schio before joining the Vatican\\'s diplomatic corps.While closely associated with Francis’ pontificate, Parolin is much more demure in personality and diplomatic in his approach to leading than the Argentine Jesuit he served — and he knows where the Catholic Church might need a course correction. Many see him as embodying Francis\\' pastoral message while being more open to conservative points of view. While his career has been spent in Italy, his job as a Vatican diplomat has seen him travel the world, giving him a global perspective.If he were elected, he would return an Italian to the papacy after three successive outsiders: St. John Paul II (Poland), Pope Benedict XVI (Germany) and Francis (Argentina).\\n```\\n\\n## [The Chemistry of the Papal Conclave’s Black and White Smoke](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/chemistry-of-the-papal-conclaves-black-and-white-smoke/) (#48460)\\n\\n> 2025-05-07 11:00:00+00:00\\n\\n```\\nMay 7, 20253 min readThe Pyrotechnic Chemistry of the Vatican’s Pope Smoke Signals ExplainedPyrotechnic chemistry drives the Vatican’s recipes for the black and white smoke used to announce papal election outcomesBy Meghan Bartels edited by Clara MoskowitzBlack smoke billows from the chimney on the roof of the Sistine Chapel indicating that the College of Cardinals have failed to elect a new Pope on March 13, 2013 in Vatican City, Vatican. Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesThe Vatican’s cardinals gather in conclave today to begin electing the successor to the late Pope Francis—which means the world’s attention is on a chimney attached to the Sistine Chapel. Here puffs of black smoke mark voting rounds that fail to converge on a winner until the cardinals announce that they have come to an agreement by releasing a plume of white smoke, the dramatic prelude to the unveiling of the new leader of the Roman Catholic world.Although the ritual may feel like something from another era, the papal conclave’s colored smoke signals only came into use in 1903, according to NBC News—a relatively recent development for a process that’s been going on for nearly a millennium. Historically, the signals have sometimes been ambiguous, but for recent elections, the Vatican has clearly consulted with scientific experts to ensure the Sistine Chapel’s chimney announces a clear verdict. Around the time of the 2013 conclave that elected Pope Francis, the Vatican published the ingredients of each smoke mix. (The Holy See Press Office did not respond to requests for confirmation that the same recipes remain in use this year.) Here’s the chemistry behind the conclave’s smoke announcements.On supporting science journalismIf you\\'re enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.For chemists, “where there’s smoke, there’s fire” refers to combustion. In combustion reactions, a fuel reacts with an oxygen-rich substance called an oxidizer, creating waste products that often include water and carbon dioxide.But the Vatican’s focus is the smoke, rather than the combustion that creates it. Smoke is made up of small particles suspended in air, says John Steinberg, a pyrotechnics expert. The smoke’s color is dictated by the particle color, which means white and black colored smoke result from waste products other than carbon dioxide, which is colorless. “You don’t want complete combustion because if we burn carbon completely, we get carbon dioxide,” he says.The solution, Steinberg explains, is to stop the reaction before the fuel is fully burned—a goal that can be accomplished by designing a reaction with more fuel than oxidizer and by lowering the temperature at which it occurs. These principles underlie both smokes produced by the Vatican conclave.When a round of voting is inconclusive, the conclave sends black smoke up through the chimney. Here the pyrotechnics at play are straightforward because black particles are simple to create—they result from most types of organic fuels. “Black smoke is the easiest” to make, Steinberg says.The 2013 recipe for black smoke consists of a mix of potassium perchlorate, anthracene and sulfur. In this reaction, potassium perchlorate is the oxygen-rich oxidizer, a role it frequently serves in fireworks because it is fairly safe and easily gives up its oxygen; anthracene is the fuel. But anthracene is relatively difficult to burn, Steinberg explains—hence the addition of a little sulfur. The sulfur melts at a low temperature, allowing the potassium perchlorate and anthracene to mix more thoroughly; sulfur also burns easily, encouraging the mixture to combust.White smoke from the roof of the Sistine Chapel indicating the election of Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio as Roman Pontiff with the name of Pope Francis I in Vatican City on March 13, 2013.Grzegorz Galazka/Mondadori Portfolio via Getty ImagesChemically speaking, white smoke is more challenging, Steinberg says. Some sources of white particles, such as zinc chloride or ammonium chloride, can be strongly irritating—which the Vatican seems to have wanted to avoid. Instead the 2013 recipe calls for potassium chlorate, the common sugar lactose and a type of pine resin sometimes known as Greek pitch.The first two ingredients are a common pair, Steinberg says: “Any pyrotechnician knows that if you want smoke, you start with potassium chlorate and sugar.” Potassium chlorate includes one fewer atom of oxygen per molecule than the potassium perchlorate used in black smoke and is an even stronger oxidizer—so strong it’s dangerous to use with combustion-prone sulfur. The powerful oxidizer is required in this case, however, because neither sugar nor pine resin are particularly eager to burn, Steinberg says.It’s the pine resin that lends the papal smoke its white hue. Pine resin is relatively rich in water and long chains of oxygen-containing hydrocarbons called carboxylic acids. Together the water and carboxylic acids ensure the combustion produces an artificial cloud of water vapor to herald the new pope. “That’s basically what this smoke is,” Steinberg says. “It’s a dense fog of water droplets.”\\n```\\n\\n## [Vatican Smoke Cam: How to Stream the Actual Papal Conclave](http://www.vulture.com/article/pope-smoke-cam-livestream-vatican.html) (#49793)\\n\\n> 2025-05-07 22:46:35+00:00\\n\\n```\\nYou’ve heard of Pop Smoke, but Pope Smoke??\\nPhoto: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\\nYou’ve seen Conclave, now it’s time to watch the real thing.

I don’t think I’d be here if it wasn’t for you. It wasn’t that bad, but it got to the point where I didn’t like myself. I didn’t like what I was doing.\\n‘I didn’t want to be around anybody, I was very insular and Yin was the one who kept pushing me and pushing me.’\\nIn response, Yin placed her hand on Gaz’s knee and said, ‘Gaz put in so much hard work.’\\nHowever, as she went to finish her sentence to say ‘I’m so proud of him’, she clearly became choked up and very emotional before Ranvir changed the topic of conversation.\\nThe pair opened up about their close relationship despite getting a divorce on Lorraine (Picture: Ken McKay/ITV/Shutterstock)\\nResponding on X, @Colabubble described their conversation as being ‘wonderfully refreshing’.\\nIn last week’s episode, Gaz shared: ‘Being married to Yin was amazing, I did feel there’s security being married because you’re a unit, you are together.\\n‘But the breakdown of the relationship was because I became lazy. I took Yin for granted. Even to this day, I blame myself.’\\nHe continued: ‘I didn’t cope with the breakdown of the relationship at all well.’\\nGaz opened up about alcohol struggles after their marriage fell apart (Picture: BBC)\\nThe pair are taking on the adventure as best friends (Picture: BBC/Studio Lambert)\\nGaz recalled how he would drink himself ‘into a stupor’ because he didn’t speak to anyone about what he was going through.\\nHe said: ‘One of the big key things with Yin is she identified that and whilst I was going through my demons and people had given up on me, she never did. She could see what I was doing was not right.\\n‘I’m at that point now where I’m in a good place and by doing the race I want to repay her because she was there for me through the dark times and I don’t want to let her down.\\n‘I’ve let her down too many times in the past, I don’t want to do it again.’\\nAfter listening to their story, a number of Race Across The World viewers began to say they were hoping Gaz and Yin get back together.\\nGaz revealed how Yin supported him during ‘dark times’ and this was his way of repaying her (Picture: BBC/Studio Lambert)\\n‘Am I the only one secretly shipping Gaz and Yin for a reunion…?’ Claire wrote on X.\\n‘We’re all rooting for Yin and Gaz to get back together, aren’t we?’ echoed Roz, adding: ‘What a great relationship Yin and Gaz have. The casting for #raceacrosstheworld is always spot on.’\\nGemma Lettington, meanwhile, wrote: ‘Race across the world participants… Gaz and Yin… anyone think they still love each other?’\\n‘Yin and Gaz, if you’re out there in Twitter land, please tell us you’re back together,’ added Rich. Not everyone was so enthusiastic about the pair’s potential reunion, though, and were just happy to see an exes portrayed positively for once.\\nThe pair have been separated for around three years (Picture: BBC/Studio Lambert)\\n‘Whether or not Gaz and Yin’s relationship is purely platonic or not, is their business,’ wrote @CHEEEKYsausage on X. ‘It’s just nice to see an ex-married couple without spite and malice, support one another. Their dynamic is fascinating to me.’‘An ex-wife who didn’t give up on her ex-husband. Yin is an angel. #raceacrosstheworld,’ added Honey Bee.Cex, meanwhile, noted that the pair’s situation isn’t that unusual, claiming, ‘My uncle and aunt are the same, always together but not together.’\\nWhen asked about why they wanted to take part in the series, Yin had previously explained: ‘The last year has been quite a personal journey for me.\\nThe couple teared up as they spoke of their daughter (Picture: BBC/Studio Lambert)\\n‘Gaz and I, although we used to be married, we’ve been separated for about three years. And then when we split up, I found another partner, but he passed away suddenly in September.\\n‘The last year has been tough, but one of the things that Chris gave me was a real sense of adventure, and he really liked travelling.\\n‘We talked a lot about travelling, and so when this came along, I thought why not, something inside me made me fill out the application form.’\\nYin was living in Gaz’s under-the-stairs cupboard at the time as he was looking after her during her grieving period, and suggested the idea of Race Across The World to him.\\nYin and Gaz are parents to 23-year-old Autumn (Picture: BBC)\\nShe added: ‘He was like, yeah, whatever. He probably just said it more to amuse me, because he obviously knew what I was going through at that moment. But before we knew it, he’d filled out the application and the journey had begun!’\\nThe couple split around three years ago, and have a 23-year-old daughter together.\\nDuring last week’s episode, Yin held back tears as she spoke about missing their daughter Autumn and not being with her to celebrate her birthday.\\nCalling their child the proudest part of their marriage, Yin said: ‘We’ve always managed to put our differences aside for Autumn.\\n‘I don’t know why it works or how it works, but it works.’\\nGaz replied: ‘It does, it’s unique, but it does.’\\nViewers have thrown their support behind Yin and Gaz (Picture: BBC)\\nSpeaking about their daughter, Yin continued: ‘Taking part in the race, Autumn sees it as a last adventure together. Time has move on, she has now grown up, we are both different people.\\n‘She understands me and Gaz are going on a different path and living our own lives, we still want to be supportive of each other but me and Gaz want to get back to engaging with life again and start enjoying it again.’\\nRace Across The World airs Wednesdays at 9pm on BBC One and iPlayer.\\nDeals of the Day\\nOne application of this gel and my puffy hay fever face was lifted and plump\\nNail the Western style come festival season with this Free People-inspired jacket\\n\\'Extremely good\\' Morrisons wines under £13 you need to try this summer\\n‘Like sleeping on a cloud’ hail shoppers as £12 mattress protector scores glowing reviews\\nTesting the Uniqlo Round Mini Shoulder Bag – how much can it really hold?\\nThis article was originally published on April 30.\\nGot a story?\\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\\nArrow\\nMORE: Stacey Solomon ‘doesn’t think’ she had sex with Joe Swash for whole year\\nArrow\\nMORE: BBC presenter, 40, announces pregnancy live on air after ‘emotional’ fertility struggle\\nArrow\\nMORE: TV star dubbed ‘everyone’s childhood crush in the 80s’ becomes a granny\\nTV Newsletter\\nSign up and tell us which TV shows you love to watch to get personalised updates every morning.\\n```\\n\\n</articles>\\n\\nBEGIN ARTICLE QUALITY CHECK:\\nBefore proceeding with analysis, verify if the articles contain sufficient information:\\n1.

The man who drove his car through Jennifer Aniston’s gates has been charged with stalking and vandalism. “Stalking is a crime that can quickly escalate from harassment to dangerous, violent actions, threatening the safety of victims and our communities,” District Attorney Nathan Hotchman said in a statement obtained by Variety. “My office is committed to aggressively prosecuting those who stalk and terrorize others, ensuring they are held accountable.” Along with one count of stalking and one of vandalism, Jimmy Wayne Carwyle faces an aggravating circumstance of the threat of great bodily harm, which would beef up his sentence if convicted. He faces three years in state prison.\\nOriginal story follows.\\nThe man who was arrested for allegedly driving a car through the gates outside Jennifer Aniston’s home in Los Angeles is now being investigated for possible stalking, law enforcement told TMZ. The Friends star was at home when the incident happened, and her security is said to have held 48-year-old Jimmy Wayne Carwyle at gunpoint until officers arrived and booked him on suspicion of felony vandalism. A public Facebook account under Carwyle’s name has previously made multiple disturbing posts about Aniston, including several that refer to her as his wife or soulmate. A September 2024 post addressed to Aniston declares in all caps, “I fucking love you, come get me or call me, tell me our address!, If not, I’m coming hunting next weekend!” The following month, another all-caps post suggests that there are forces of “corruption” keeping them apart.\\nCarwyle quit his job as an automobile-service technician five years ago and has since suffered from delusions that he is a Christlike figure who is married to Aniston, his childhood friend Steve Rhea claimed to NBC News on Tuesday. According to Rhea, Carwyle left his native Mississippi in September to start living out of his car at a Walmart in Burbank. “We just hope he gets the help he needs,” Rhea said. “I hope there’s some way to fix him, but I don’t know.” Carwyle, who has not been formally charged, is currently being held in the L.A.

Check if articles appear empty or contain minimal text (fewer than ~50 words each)\\n2. Check for paywall indicators (\"subscribe to continue\", \"premium content\", etc.)\\n3. Check if articles only contain headlines/URLs but no actual content\\n4. Check if articles appear truncated or cut off mid-sentence\\n\\nIf ANY of these conditions are true, return ONLY this JSON structure inside <final_json> tags:\\n<final_json>\\n{\\n    \"status\": \"incomplete\",\\n    \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why analysis couldn\\'t be completed (empty articles, paywalled content, etc.)\",\\n    \"availableInfo\": \"Brief summary of any information that was available\"\\n}\\n</final_json>\\n\\nONLY IF the articles contain sufficient information for analysis, proceed with the full analysis below:\\n\\nYour goal is to extract and synthesize information from these articles into a structured format suitable for generating a daily intelligence brief.\\n\\nBefore addressing the main categories, conduct a preliminary analysis:\\na) List key themes across all articles\\nb) Note any recurring names, places, or events\\nc) Identify potential biases or conflicting information\\nIt\\'s okay for this section to be quite long as it helps structure your thinking.\\n\\nThen, after your preliminary analysis, present your final analysis in a structured JSON format inside <final_json> tags. This must be valid, parseable JSON that follows this **exact refined structure**:\\n\\n**Detailed Instructions for JSON Fields:**\\n*   **`status`**: \\'complete\\' or \\'incomplete\\'\\n*   **`title`**: Terse, neutral title of the story\\n*   **`executiveSummary`**: Provide a 2-4 sentence concise summary highlighting the most critical developments, key conflicts, and overall assessment from the articles. This should be suitable for a quick read in a daily brief.\\n*   **`storyStatus`**: Assess the current state of the story\\'s development based *only* on the information in the articles. Use one of: \\'Developing\\', \\'Escalating\\', \\'De-escalating\\', \\'Concluding\\', \\'Static\\'.\\n*   **`timeline`**: List key events in chronological order.\\n    *   `description`: Keep descriptions brief and factual.\\n    *   `importance`: Assess the event\\'s importance to understanding the overall narrative (High/Medium/Low). High importance implies the event is central to the story\\'s development or outcome.\\n*   **`signalStrength`**: Assess the overall reliability of the reporting *in this cluster*.\\n    *   `assessment`: Use a qualitative term: \\'Very High\\', \\'High\\', \\'Moderate\\', \\'Low\\', \\'Very Low\\'.\\n    *   `reasoning`: Justify the assessment based on source corroboration (how many sources report the same core facts?), source quality/reliability (mix of reputable vs. biased sources?), presence of official statements, and degree of conflicting information on core facts.\\n*   **`undisputedKeyFacts`**: List core factual points that are corroborated across multiple, generally reliable sources within the cluster. Avoid claims made only by highly biased sources unless corroborated.\\n*   **`keyEntities`**: Identify the main actors.\\n    *   `list`: Provide basic identification and their role/involvement.\\n    *   `perspectives.statedPositions`: Focus *only* on the goals, viewpoints, or justifications explicitly stated or clearly implied by the entity *as reported in the articles*. Avoid listing conflicting claims here (that goes in `contradictions`).\\n*   **`keySources`**: Analyze the provided news sources.\\n    *   `provided_articles_sources.reliabilityAssessment`: Assess the source\\'s general reliability based on reputation, known biases (political, state affiliation, ideological), and fact-checking standards. Use terms like \\'High Reliability\\', \\'Moderate Reliability\\', \\'Low Reliability\\', \\'State-Affiliated/Propaganda Outlet\\'. Be specific about the *type* of bias.\\n    *   `provided_articles_sources.framing`: Describe the narrative angle or style used by the source (e.g., \\'Emphasizes security threat\\', \\'Focuses on human rights angle\\', \\'Uses neutral language\\', \\'Uses loaded/emotional language\\', \\'Presents government narrative uncritically\\').\\n    *   `contradictions`: Detail specific points of disagreement *between sources* or *between entities as reported by sources*.\\n        *   `issue`: Clearly state what is being contested.\\n        *   `conflictingClaims`: List the different versions, specifying the `source` reporting it, the `claim` itself, and optionally the `entityClaimed` if the source attributes the claim to a specific entity. Critically evaluate claims originating solely from low-reliability/propaganda sources.\\n*   **`context`**: List essential background information *mentioned or clearly implied in the articles* needed to understand the story.\\n*   **`informationGaps`**: Identify crucial pieces of information *missing* from the articles that would be needed for a complete understanding.\\n*   **`significance`**: Assess the overall importance of the reported events.\\n    *   `assessment`: Use a qualitative term: \\'Critical\\', \\'High\\', \\'Moderate\\', \\'Low\\'.\\n    *   `reasoning`: Explain *why* this story matters. Consider immediate impact, potential future developments, strategic implications, precedent setting, regional/global relevance.\\n    *   `score`: An integer between 0 (lowest importance story) and 10 (most critical story)\\n\\n**Refined JSON Structure to Follow:**\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \"status\": \"complete\",\\n    \"title\": \"string\",\\n    \"executiveSummary\": \"string\",\\n    \"storyStatus\": \"string\",\\n    \"timeline\": [\\n        {\\n            \"date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD or approximate\",\\n            \"description\": \"brief event description\",\\n            \"importance\": \"string: High/Medium/Low\"\\n        }\\n    ],\\n    \"signalStrength\": {\\n        \"assessment\": \"string: Very High/High/Moderate/Low/Very Low\",\\n        \"reasoning\": \"string\"\\n    },\\n    \"undisputedKeyFacts\": [\\n        \"string\"\\n    ],\\n    \"keyEntities\": {\\n        \"list\": [\\n            {\\n                \"name\": \"entity name\",\\n                \"type\": \"type of entity\",\\n                \"description\": \"brief description\",\\n                \"involvement\": \"why/how involved?\"\\n            }\\n        ],\\n        \"perspectives\": [\\n            {\\n                \"entity\": \"entity name\",\\n                \"statedPositions\": [\\n                    \"string\"\\n                ]\\n            }\\n        ]\\n    },\\n    \"keySources\": {\\n        \"provided_articles_sources\": [\\n            {\\n                \"name\": \"source entity name\",\\n                \"articles\": [], // int array of IDs\\n                \"reliabilityAssessment\": \"string\",\\n                \"framing\": [\\n                    \"string\"\\n                ]\\n            }\\n        ],\\n        \"contradictions\": [\\n            {\\n                \"issue\": \"string\",\\n                \"conflictingClaims\": [\\n                    {\\n                        \"source\": \"media source name\",\\n                        \"entityClaimed\": \"entity name (optional)\",\\n                        \"claim\": \"string\"\\n                    }\\n                ]\\n            }\\n        ]\\n    },\\n    \"context\": [\\n        \"string\"\\n    ],\\n    \"informationGaps\": [\\n        \"string\"\\n    ],\\n    \"significance\": {\\n        \"assessment\": \"string: Critical/High/Moderate/Low\",\\n        \"reasoning\": \"string\",\\n        \"score\": 0\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**CRITICAL Quality & Consistency Requirements:**\\n\\n*   **Thoroughness:** Ensure all fields, especially descriptions, reasoning, context, and summaries, are detailed and specific.

      "{'id': 48, 'title': 'Vatican Impasse, PSG Victory, US-UK Trade & Housing Debates', 'content': '## Main Stories\\n\\n<u>**Vatican Deadlock: Cardinals Still Seeking Successor to Pope Francis**</u>\\nThe College of Cardinals remains locked in the Sistine Chapel, with black smoke on **May 7th and 8th** signaling no consensus yet on the next Pope. The **133 cardinals** are tasked with navigating deep divisions within the Church, essentially casting a vote on the legacy of **Pope Francis**, who passed on **April 21, 2025**. This isn\\'t just about a new leader; it\\'s about the future direction of an institution with 1.4 billion adherents.\\n\\nThe process is steeped in tradition, requiring a two-thirds majority. Names like Cardinals **Pietro Parolin** and **Luis Antonio Tagle** are circulating as potential frontrunners, though the secrecy of the conclave means concrete information is scarce. The Dean of the College, **Giovanni Battista Re**, has urged the selection of a Pope capable of awakening \"moral and spiritual energies\" and maintaining Church unity – a tall order given the current climate, which includes the ongoing sexual abuse crisis and debates between progressive and conservative factions. The betting markets, as reported by **International Business Times**, give **Parolin** a 27% chance and **Tagle** 22%, but such speculation is just that. The reality is, the cardinals are under immense pressure to choose a figure who can guide the Church through turbulent waters.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**PSG Clinches Champions League Final Berth, Ending Arsenal\\'s Hopes**</u>\\n**Paris Saint-Germain** has secured its place in the Champions League final against **Inter Milan** after a 2-1 victory over **Arsenal** in Paris, sealing a 3-1 aggregate win. The French side, still chasing its first Champions League trophy, will meet Inter on **May 31st** at Munich\\'s **Allianz Arena**. For Arsenal, it\\'s another season of what might have been, with manager **Mikel Arteta** lamenting missed opportunities.\\n\\nArteta pointed to the \"brilliance\" of PSG\\'s goalkeeper, **Gianluigi Donnarumma**, as a decisive factor, a sentiment echoed by many observers. **Donnarumma\\'s** performance, particularly in key moments, effectively shut down Arsenal\\'s aspirations. Goals from **Fabian Ruiz** and **Achraf Hakimi** for PSG overcame **Bukayo Saka\\'s** strike for the Gunners. Arsenal players were reportedly devastated, a testament to their desire, but as **Arteta** and players like **Declan Rice** and **Martin Odegaard** acknowledged, a lack of clinical finishing and crucial mistakes proved costly. This outcome underscores PSG\\'s continued ambition on the European stage and highlights Arsenal\\'s ongoing struggle to convert strong performances into major silverware.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**US and UK Forge Trade Pact in Shifting Tariff Environment**</u>\\nThe **United States** and the **United Kingdom** have announced a trade agreement, the first significant pact since President **Trump** initiated a broad 10% tariff on most imports on **April 2nd, 2025**. Details remain somewhat opaque; **Trump** himself, via Truth Social, termed it \"full and comprehensive,\" while other reports, including one from **The Wall Street Journal** (via **France24**), describe it more as a \"framework.\" This ambiguity is typical of early-stage announcements, but the timing is noteworthy.\\n\\nThe deal emerges against a backdrop of **Trump\\'s** aggressive tariff strategy, which he claims brings nations to the negotiating table. The **UK**, under Prime Minister **Keir Starmer**, had reportedly been pushing for a deal to preempt such tariffs. **Starmer** has committed to acting in the \"national interest.\" Simultaneously, the **Federal Reserve**, chaired by **Jerome Powell**, is resisting pressure from **Trump** to cut interest rates, citing economic uncertainty and the need for independence. This new US-UK understanding will be closely watched, especially with upcoming US-China trade talks in Switzerland and an EU-UK summit scheduled for **May 19th**. An interesting sidebar, reported by **Gizmodo** (via **Washington Post**), notes **Elon Musk\\'s Starlink** securing deals with countries like **Lesotho** around the time of tariff implementations, suggesting some entities are adept at navigating, or perhaps benefiting from, this volatile trade landscape.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**Trump White House: Health Agendas, Immigration Battles, and First Lady\\'s Low Profile**</u>\\nThe **Trump administration** is advancing its agenda on multiple fronts, marked by personnel shifts and significant policy initiatives, even as questions linger about First Lady **Melania Trump\\'s** notably infrequent presence at the White House – reportedly fewer than 14 days since the **January inauguration**. On the health front, **Trump** has nominated **Dr. Casey Means** as Surgeon General, replacing **Janette Nesheiwat**. **Means**, described as having \"impeccable MAHA credentials\" by **Trump**, is an advocate for investigating vaccine safety and aligns with the administration\\'s \\'Make America Healthy Again\\' (MAHA) focus. This is further underscored by HHS Secretary **Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\\'s** announcement of a joint **NIH** (headed by **Jay Bhattacharya**) and **CMS** (headed by **Mehmet Oz**) project to study autism and chronic diseases, aiming to \"uncover root causes.\"\\n\\nImmigration remains a flashpoint. A federal judge, **Jamal Whitehead**, has ordered the administration to resume refugee resettlement, a direct challenge to its policies. More controversially, reports indicate plans to deport migrants to **Libya**, a move **NPR** suggests **Trump** initially claimed ignorance of, despite other indications of administration planning. **Marco Rubio** has stated such third-country deportations aim to deter repeat border crossings. These domestic policy battles and international maneuvers, including ongoing nuclear talks with **Iran** and addressing the **Ukraine** conflict, paint a picture of an administration actively shaping policy amidst legal and public scrutiny. The **Real ID law** also finally took effect on **May 7th** after a 20-year delay, a less contentious but still significant administrative change.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**Global Housing Squeeze: Washington State Tries Rent Caps, Australia Debates Generational Blame**</u>\\nThe intractable problem of housing affordability continues to generate policy responses and social friction globally. In the **United States**, **Washington state** has taken a direct step, with Governor **Bob Ferguson** signing a rent control bill into law on **May 7th**. This legislation, sponsored by State Senator **Emily Alvarado**, caps annual rent increases at 7% plus inflation, or 10%, whichever is lower, reflecting a belief that \"housing is a basic human need.\" This follows **Oregon\\'s** similar move in **2019**.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in **Australia**, where the median dwelling price hovers around **$814,000**, **AMP** deputy chief economist **Diana Mousina** is pushing back against the narrative, popularized by figures like property tycoon **Tim Gurner** (of \"avocado toast\" fame), that young people\\'s spending habits are to blame for their inability to enter the property market. **Mousina** argues the \"divide between the haves and have-nots has probably never been wider,\" citing systemic affordability issues. Across the Pacific, a piece in **The Nation** critiques both purely market-based solutions and simple calls for more social housing in the US, with figures like **Mike Gecan** advocating for a more robust, citizen-powered strategy to build affordable homes at scale. These varying approaches and debates underscore the complexity and urgency of a crisis felt acutely in many developed nations.\\n\\n## Global landscape\\n\\n### Power & politics\\n\\n<u>**Trump\\'s Domestic Agenda Casts Long International Shadows**</u>\\nThe **Trump administration\\'s** current domestic focus—personnel, health initiatives, and immigration—carries significant international weight. The nomination of **Dr. Casey Means** for Surgeon General and HHS Secretary **RFK Jr.\\'s** health projects, while internally directed, signal a US public health posture that will be observed globally, particularly concerning vaccine policies and approaches to chronic illness. These choices reflect the administration\\'s \"Make America Healthy Again\" (MAHA) platform, which could influence international health dialogues.\\n\\nMore directly, the administration\\'s immigration policies are creating international ripples. The court order to resume refugee resettlement clashes with a restrictive stance, while the reported plan to deport migrants to **Libya**—a nation that has already rejected the idea—raises serious human rights concerns and could complicate diplomatic relations. This strategy, aimed at deterring border crossings, as articulated by figures like **Marco Rubio**, places the US in a contentious position internationally. These actions, coupled with ongoing nuclear talks with **Iran** and managing the **Ukraine** conflict, demonstrate an administration whose domestic priorities are inextricably linked to its global standing and foreign policy challenges. Even the First Lady **Melania Trump\\'s** limited public presence, while a softer issue, contributes to the overall image and perception of the US leadership on the world stage.\\n\\n## Economic currents\\n\\n<u>**US-UK Trade Deal: A Ripple in Trump\\'s Tariff-Driven Economic Waters**</u>\\nThe newly announced trade deal between the **US** and the **UK**, however vaguely defined at this stage, is a direct product of President **Trump\\'s** aggressive tariff strategy. His imposition of a 10% tariff on most imports, with higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on select countries, has reshaped the global trade calculus. **Trump** views these tariffs as leverage, and the UK deal, announced on **May 8th**, is presented as validation of this approach. Whether it\\'s a \"full and comprehensive\" agreement, as **Trump** claims, or merely a \"framework,\" as some reports suggest, its primary economic significance lies in its timing and context.\\n\\nThis development occurs as the **Federal Reserve**, under **Jerome Powell**, maintains steady interest rates, resisting White House pressure for cuts amidst economic uncertainty fueled by these same trade tensions and the ongoing US-China trade war. The upcoming US-China talks in Switzerland will be a critical test of this tariff-centric diplomacy. For the **UK**, Prime Minister **Keir Starmer** is navigating a path to secure favorable terms post-Brexit, with this deal being a key component. The broader economic impact will depend on the actual substance of the agreement, which remains to be seen. The side-story of **Starlink** securing deals in tariff-affected nations like **Lesotho** hints at the opportunistic economic plays emerging in this disrupted environment.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**Housing Affordability: Policy Interventions and Economic Divides**</u>\\nThe persistent crisis in housing affordability is prompting varied economic responses across developed nations, highlighting deep-seated economic pressures. **Washington state\\'s** decision to implement rent control, capping annual increases, is a direct market intervention aimed at alleviating pressure on renters. Governor **Bob Ferguson** and bill sponsor Senator **Emily Alvarado** frame this as a necessary measure to ensure housing stability, a move that directly impacts the rental market\\'s economics and landlord profitability.\\n\\nIn **Australia**, the debate around housing affordability, with a median dwelling price near **$814,000**, increasingly focuses on structural economic issues rather than individual spending habits. **AMP** economist **Diana Mousina\\'s** assertion that the wealth gap is a primary driver challenges simpler narratives and points to broader economic inequalities. This contrasts with the US, where **The Nation** reports critiques of both supply-side arguments (like those from **Ezra Klein** and **Derek Thompson\\'s** \"Abundance\" thesis, which often focus on zoning) and solely demand-side solutions (like massive social housing investment). Instead, figures like **Mike Gecan** call for strategies that build affordable housing at scale through organized citizen power, suggesting that current tax credits often favor renting over owning and fail to close the equity gap. These discussions reveal a global search for effective economic levers to address a crisis with profound social and economic consequences.', 'totalArticles': 184, 'totalSources': 280, 'usedArticles': 29, 'usedSources': 17, 'tldr': '[Vatican: Papal Conclave Deadlock]\\nThe College of Cardinals, comprised of 133 members, remains deadlocked in its search for a successor to Pope Francis.

    "3.  Assigning individual story titles and grouped titles to the most appropriate section based on significance and user interests (geopolitics, France, China, tech).\n",
    "4.  **Outputting *only* the section structure and the actual titles of the assigned stories.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Brief Structure & Section Guidelines:** (Use these to categorize)\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`## Main Stories`**: Titles representing the up to 10 most important/impactful overall developments *from this batch*, based on relative significance and thematic importance. Use judgment. If multiple stories cover facets of one *major* event/theme, select the title representing the core update or highest impact for this section. Try to keep the top spots for newest developments (i.e if we reported on something yesterday, it should only be in the top 3 if it's truly huge, otherwise leave the top spots for the newest developments)\n",
    "2.  **`## United Kingdom focus`**: Titles primarily focused on the UK.\n",
    "3.  **`## Global landscape`**: (Includes `### Power & politics`). Titles covering broader geopolitics, international relations.\n",
    "4.  **`## China monitor`**: Titles primarily focused on China (policy, economy, tech, etc.).\n",
    "5.  **`## Economic currents`**: Titles covering significant global/regional economic news, trends, policy, cryptocurrency especially bitcoin news.\n",
    "6.  **`## Tech & science developments`**: Titles covering AI/LLMs, biomed, space breakthroughs, etc.\n",
    "7.  **`## Noteworthy & under-reported`**: Titles for interesting/potentially important stories not fitting elsewhere, emerging trends. (Up to ~5 titles).\n",
    "8.  **`## Positive developments`**: Titles for genuinely positive outcomes. (Include only if applicable).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Analyze Holistically:** First, carefully read *all* provided `<story>` summaries below (titles and summaries) to understand the key events, themes, and potential connections *before* assigning anything. Think about the bigger picture revealed by the collection.\n",
    "2.  **Select \"What You Need To Know Now\":** Identify the *actual titles* of the stories representing the top ~10 most significant overall developments or themes within this batch. List these titles under `## what matters now`, ordered by significance/impact.\n",
    "3.  **Assign & Group Remaining Story Titles:** For the ***remaining*** stories:\n",
    "    *   Assign each story's **actual Title** to the single most appropriate section.\n",
    "    *   **Group Related Titles:** If two or more stories cover the same specific event, interconnected themes, or closely linked developments, place their **actual Titles consecutively** *within* the single most relevant section.\n",
    "    *   **Prioritize Group Placement:** Assign the *entire group* of related titles to the section that best captures their central theme.\n",
    "4.  **Formatting:**\n",
    "    *   Format the output *exactly* as shown in the example below, using the appropriate section headers (`## Section Name`, `### Power & politics`).\n",
    "    *   List **only the actual `Title`** of each story under its assigned section, preceded by `###`.\n",
    "    *   Use `---` as a separator between *each* story title listed.\n",
    "    *   If a section has no relevant stories, **omit the section header entirely**.\n",
    "5.  **Output:**\n",
    "    *   **Do NOT include introductory/concluding text, explanations, the `<story>` tags, or the executive summaries.**\n",
    "    *   **Output ONLY the structured markdown outline consisting of section headers and the actual story titles from the input data.**\n",
    "    \n",
    "**--- CONTEXT FROM PREVIOUS DAY (IF AVAILABLE) ---**\n",
    "*   You *may* receive a section at the beginning of the curated data titled `## Previous Day's Coverage Context (YYYY-MM-DD)`.\n",
    "*   Use this list **only** to understand which topics are ongoing and their last known status/theme.\n",
    "*   Focus on **today's developments** based on the main `<input_data>`. Reference past context briefly *only if essential*.\n",

      "Sending converted contents format: [{'role': 'user', 'parts': [{'text': '<brief>\\n## Main Stories\\n\\n<u>**Kashmir Ignites Again: Subcontinental Tensions Spike After Indian Strikes**</u>\\nThe fragile peace between **India** and **Pakistan** has shattered following a deadly terrorist attack in **Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir**, on **April 22**, which claimed 26 lives, predominantly tourists. **India**, under Prime Minister **Narendra Modi**, responded on **May 7** with missile strikes against what it termed terrorist training camps across nine sites in **Pakistan** and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. **Pakistan**, led by Prime Minister **Shehbaz Sharif**, condemned these actions as an \"act of war,\" vowing retaliation and claiming to have downed five Indian aircraft – a claim **New Delhi** has not corroborated.\\n\\nThe escalation between these two nuclear-armed neighbors has, predictably, drawn international calls for restraint. However, a notable shift is the apparently diminished role of the **United States** in active mediation, a departure from previous crises. This leaves a concerning vacuum, increasing the risk of miscalculation. Both sides are trading accusations, with **India** blaming Pakistan-backed militants like **Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT)** for the **Pahalgam** attack, while **Pakistan** insists the Indian strikes hit civilian areas, not militant infrastructure. The **Resistance Front** claimed responsibility for the initial attack.\\n\\nThe credibility of claims from both sides is, as usual, difficult to verify independently. Domestic political pressures undoubtedly play a role, with both **Modi** and **Sharif**, alongside Pakistan\\'s influential Army Chief **Asim Munir**, needing to project strength. The core issue of **Kashmir** remains the festering wound, and without robust third-party de-escalation efforts, the situation could spiral further. The rhetoric is heated, and the potential for this to escalate beyond retaliatory strikes is uncomfortably high.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**Starmer\\'s Benefit Squeeze: Labour Faces Internal Revolt and Public Ire**</u>\\nThe **Labour** government, helmed by Prime Minister **Keir Starmer**, is navigating treacherous waters as it pushes forward with significant cuts to disability benefits, specifically Personal Independence Payments (**PIP**) and Universal Credit (**UC**), alongside the earlier scrapping of winter fuel payments for most pensioners. These austerity measures, defended by Chancellor **Rachel Reeves** and Disability Minister **Stephen Timms** as fiscally necessary to ensure long-term sustainability and incentivize employment, are provoking a fierce backlash.\\n\\nThe dissent is not merely external. Recent poor local election results, where **Labour** lost 187 council seats, have emboldened a growing faction of **Labour MPs** who are now openly threatening to vote against the proposals. Figures like **Tan Dhesi**, **Ian Byrne**, and **Diane Abbott** are voicing strong opposition, arguing the cuts disproportionately harm the most vulnerable. Even the traditionally supportive **Daily Mirror** has criticized **Starmer\\'s** refusal to reverse the winter fuel payment cuts, signaling a deepening unease.\\n\\nThis internal rebellion presents a significant test of **Starmer\\'s** authority and the government\\'s stability, particularly given its landslide victory last year. The government\\'s argument of fiscal prudence is clashing sharply with accusations of balancing the books on the backs of the vulnerable. This discontent risks alienating core **Labour** voters and provides fertile ground for opposition parties like **Reform UK**, especially in the so-called **Red Wall** constituencies. The government\\'s projected savings of £5bn a year by 2030 are being weighed against the immediate human cost and political damage.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**Vatican Deadlock: Cardinals Struggle to Find Francis\\'s Successor Amidst Division**</u>\\nBlack smoke has billowed from the **Sistine Chapel** chimney for a second consecutive day, signaling that the **133 cardinals** gathered in conclave have yet to reach the required two-thirds majority to elect a successor to **Pope Francis**, who passed away on **April 21, 2025**. The cardinals, sequestered from the outside world, are engaged in multiple daily rounds of voting.\\n\\nThis election is widely viewed as a referendum on **Pope Francis\\'s** often progressive legacy, and the protracted voting underscores deep ideological divisions within the **College of Cardinals**. Conservative and progressive factions are reportedly at odds over the future direction of the Catholic Church. The next pontiff will inherit a complex set of challenges, including strained Vatican finances and the ongoing sexual abuse crisis, issues that demand decisive leadership.\\n\\nWhile names like Italian Cardinal **Pietro Parolin** (Francis\\'s former Secretary of State) and Cardinal **Luis Antonio Tagle** of the Philippines are frequently mentioned as *papabili*, along with others like **Matteo Zuppi** and **Jean-Marc Aveline**, the continued deadlock suggests no single candidate currently commands broad consensus. The longer the process takes, the more apparent these internal schisms become, with significant implications for the 1.4 billion Catholics worldwide and the Church\\'s role on the global stage.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**Australian Election Upset: Polling Failures and Liberal Party Soul-Searching**</u>\\nThe **2025 Australian federal election** delivered a series of surprises, most notably Labor exceeding poll predictions to secure unexpected victories. Labor\\'s **Sarah Witty** unseated Greens leader **Adam Bandt** in Melbourne, and, in a major upset, Labor\\'s **Ali France** defeated Liberal leader **Peter Dutton** in his Queensland seat of Dickson. These results have thrown a harsh spotlight on the accuracy of pre-election polling, with suggestions of \\'herding\\' among pollsters or flawed methodologies underestimating Labor\\'s support.\\n\\nThe **Liberal Party** faces a period of introspection. The loss of its leader and key seats points to significant challenges, including a perceived disconnect with female voters and a lack of female representation within its own ranks. Figures like **Maria Kovacic** are calling for modernization, potentially including quotas, to broaden the party\\'s appeal beyond its traditional base. **Dutton** himself had dismissed concerns about his seat pre-election as a \\'propaganda campaign\\'. The role of organizations like **Climate 200**, which backed an independent in Dickson and shared polling data with Labor, also highlights the shifting dynamics of Australian campaigning.\\n\\nThe post-mortem will undoubtedly focus on why pollsters like **Freshwater Research** (Coalition polling) got it so wrong in Dickson, while others like **Roy Morgan** claim to have better captured the swing to Labor. The preferential voting system always allows for complex outcomes, but the scale of these upsets suggests deeper currents at play than many analysts anticipated.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**Trump Administration\\'s Conservative Push: Nominations, Policy Reversals, and Legal Battles**</u>\\nPresident **Donald Trump** is rapidly reshaping the federal government, advancing a slate of judicial and executive nominations while simultaneously rolling back Biden-era policies. Among the notable nominations is Dr. **Casey Means**, a wellness influencer with \"impeccable MAHA credentials\" according to **Trump**, for Surgeon General. **Matt Anderson** has been nominated for NASA Deputy Administrator, and several conservative jurists, including **Joshua M. Divine** and **Whitney Hermandorfer**, are tapped for federal judgeships.\\n\\nA key policy reversal is the halting of federal funding for electric vehicle charging infrastructure, a program established under the **2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law**. This move has triggered a lawsuit from seventeen states, led by California Attorney General **Rob Bonta**, who argue the decision is illegal and detrimental to transportation modernization and job creation. **Trump** has framed this as supporting **Elon Musk** and **Tesla**, though **Musk** had benefited from the original funding. Concurrently, the administration is seeking to dismiss a lawsuit challenging the **FDA\\'s** deregulation of the abortion pill, a move consistent with its conservative stance on reproductive rights.\\n\\nThese actions, coupled with the firing of Biden-appointed **NTSB** Vice Chair **Alvin Brown**, signal a decisive shift towards conservative priorities across multiple fronts, from environmental policy and healthcare to the composition of the judiciary. The legal challenges to these policy reversals will test the limits of executive power, while the Senate confirmation process for nominees like **Means** will likely be contentious.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**Climate Extremes Bite Harder: Vulnerable Populations and Food Security Under Threat**</u>\\nA confluence of extreme weather events is underscoring the escalating impacts of climate change globally. The **US South**, particularly **New Orleans**, is grappling with heavy rainfall and flooding, while farmers in the **UK** are reporting crop failures due to persistent drought conditions, as highlighted by the **National Farmers\\' Union (NFU)**. These immediate crises are set against a backdrop of grim long-term forecasts, with **AccuWeather** predicting a hotter-than-normal summer with increased hurricane activity in the US, and research from **Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB)** indicating that **Gen Alpha** (children born 2007 or later) will face unprecedented lifetime exposure to climate extremes.\\n\\nGovernment responses are varied and, in some cases, controversial. In the **UK**, the **Advanced Research and Invention Agency (Aria)** has revealed funding for real-world geoengineering experiments, a move defended as vital but one that raises significant ethical and environmental questions. Meanwhile, concerns are being voiced in the US about potential budget cuts to assistance programs like **LIHEAP**, which would disproportionately affect low-income communities already struggling with the impacts of extreme weather.\\n\\nThe signal is clear: climate change is no longer a future threat but a present and intensifying reality. The disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations, threats to food security, and the contentious debate around solutions like geoengineering highlight the complex and urgent challenges ahead. The disconnect between the scientific warnings and, in some quarters, the political will to act decisively remains a critical point of failure.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**AI\\'s Double Edge: Innovation Marches On Amidst Concerns Over Security, Bias, and Critical Thinking**</u>\\nThe rapid proliferation of Artificial Intelligence is forcing a reckoning with its multifaceted impacts. In education, tools like **ChatGPT** are raising concerns about potentially hindering critical thinking skills through \"cognitive offloading,\" as students may rely on AI rather than developing their own analytical abilities. This contrasts with tools like **Khanmigo**, designed to aid, not replace, thinking.\\n\\nSimultaneously, the **UK\\'s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)** is sounding the alarm over AI-enabled cyber threats, warning that AI is expanding attack surfaces and accelerating malicious capabilities, potentially creating a new \"digital divide.\" This security concern is amplified by geopolitical tensions, with **US lawmakers**, including Rep. **Darrell Issa**, investigating allegations of **China\\'s** systematic theft of American AI secrets, potentially through firms like **DeepSeek**, to bolster its own AI supremacy. The **Chinese embassy** has denied these claims as \"groundless.\"\\n\\nEthical considerations also loom large. Research by **InnovateHer**, a UK social enterprise, reveals that girls are more concerned about AI bias than boys, highlighting the risk of reinforcing existing societal inequalities if AI development is not carefully managed. Even practical decisions, such as **NASA\\'s** switch from **Neo4j** to **Memgraph** for its graph database needs due to cost, underscore that the AI revolution has very tangible, and sometimes expensive, infrastructural requirements. The overarching theme is one of immense potential shadowed by significant risks that demand proactive and thoughtful governance.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**Medical Research Blind Spots and Middle East Tinderbox: Women\\'s Health and Gaza Conflict Escalate**</u>\\nTwo distinct but critical issues demand attention: the persistent underrepresentation of women in UK medical trials and the dangerously escalating conflict in **Gaza**. A study by the **Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)** and the **University of Liverpool** found a significant imbalance, with more male-only trials than female-only, raising serious questions about the safety and efficacy of treatments for women. This echoes long-standing concerns, famously highlighted by **Caroline Criado Perez** in \\'Invisible Women\\', about medical research historically defaulting to the male body.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the situation in **Gaza** has deteriorated sharply. Israeli airstrikes have resulted in numerous civilian casualties, reportedly killing at least 48 people, including women and children, according to Palestinian health officials (though figures vary, with the **Hamas-run health ministry** reporting 33 in specific strikes). **Israel**, under Prime Minister **Benjamin Netanyahu**, states its military is preparing to intensify operations against **Hamas** to destroy the group and rescue remaining hostages, following **Hamas\\'s** October 7 attack. **Hamas**, in turn, accuses **Israel** of war crimes and states negotiations are pointless amidst a \"starvation war.\" Hostage negotiations have stalled, and the humanitarian crisis in **Gaza**, with severe shortages of essentials, deepens.\\n\\nAdding another layer of complexity, five Iranian men were arrested in the **UK** on **May 7** for allegedly plotting a terror attack against the Israeli embassy in London. The **Iranian government** has categorically denied involvement. These concurrent crises – one a systemic issue in medical science, the other a geopolitical flashpoint with immediate human cost – highlight profound vulnerabilities and the potential for widespread negative consequences.\\n\\n## United Kingdom focus\\n\\n<u>**Football Regulator Appointment Mired in Political Cronyism Claims**</u>\\nThe nomination of **David Kogan**, a former media executive, as the inaugural chair of the **UK\\'s Independent Football Regulator** has ignited a political firestorm. Scrutiny centers on **Kogan\\'s** past financial donations to **Keir Starmer** and Culture Secretary **Lisa Nandy\\'s** Labour leadership campaigns in 2020, and the unusual recruitment process where he was reportedly headhunted for the role by the permanent secretary of the department after not initially applying.\\n\\nConservative MPs, notably Shadow Minister for Sport **Louie French**, are alleging a \"potential breach of the Governance Code on Public Appointments\" and \"cronyism,\" calling for an investigation. **Kogan**, during a pre-appointment hearing before the **Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee** chaired by **Caroline Dinenage**, admitted to the \"very small sums\" donated but stressed his independence and commitment to making the regulator an \"asset to football, not a \\'cop\\'.\" **Downing Street** and **Starmer\\'s** spokesperson maintain that all rules were followed, and the process was a \"fair and open competition.\"\\n\\nThe **Independent Football Regulator**, being established via the **Football Governance Bill**, is a significant development born from concerns following club collapses like **Bury FC** and the European Super League debacle. It will wield considerable power, including licensing clubs and intervening in financial redistribution between the **Premier League** and the **English Football League (EFL)**. The controversy surrounding **Kogan\\'s** appointment, however, risks undermining the regulator\\'s perceived independence before it even begins its work, a critical factor given the politically charged environment of English football governance.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**UK-India Trade Deal Under Fire as EU Relations Remain Frosty**</u>\\nA newly finalized **UK-India trade deal** is drawing considerable flak, primarily over a provision granting National Insurance (NI) exemptions for up to three years to Indian workers seconded to the **UK**. Critics, including Conservative leader **Kemi Badenoch** (who claims she refused a similar deal as trade secretary) and Reform UK\\'s **Nigel Farage**, argue this creates \"two-tier taxes\" and undercuts British labor, especially as Chancellor **Rachel Reeves** recently raised NI contributions for UK employers. The **Labour** government, through Business Secretary **Jonathan Reynolds**, defends the deal as reciprocal, similar to existing agreements, and beneficial to the UK economy, projecting £4.8bn in gains by 2040.\\n\\nThis trade controversy unfolds against a backdrop of strained **UK-EU** relations. Negotiations for a youth mobility scheme are reportedly mired in disagreement, with the **EU** seeking broader access than the **UK** government, led by European relations minister **Nick Thomas-Symonds**, is willing to concede. **Thomas-Symonds** has stated the **UK** will not return to free movement. These tensions are compounded by warnings from the **Lords Science and Technology Committee** that the **UK\\'s** current visa policy is creating \"unnecessarily high barriers\" to attracting global talent, a concern likely to be addressed in the government\\'s upcoming Immigration White Paper.\\n\\nA planned summit on **May 19** between Prime Minister **Keir Starmer** and European Commission President **Ursula von der Leyen** aims to announce a new security and defense partnership, but the underlying friction on mobility and trade terms persists. The government\\'s balancing act – seeking new global trade partners while managing a complex post-Brexit relationship with the **EU** and addressing domestic concerns about immigration and labor – is proving exceptionally challenging.\\n\\n## Global landscape\\n\\n### Power & politics\\n\\n<u>**US-UK Trade Pact Emerges Amidst Trump\\'s Tariff Barrage and Global Tensions**</u>\\nPresident **Donald Trump** has announced a trade deal with the **United Kingdom**, the first significant agreement since his administration implemented sweeping \"liberation day\" tariffs, including a 10% baseline duty on most countries, in early April. The **UK**, while spared from Trump\\'s \"reciprocal\" tariffs, was subject to this baseline. Details on the scope of the US-UK deal remain somewhat opaque; **Trump** described it as \"full and comprehensive,\" while some reports, citing *The Wall Street Journal*, suggest it may be more of a \"framework\" agreement.\\n\\nThis development occurs as US trade officials, including Treasury Secretary **Scott Bessent** and US Trade Representative **Jamieson Greer**, prepare for talks with Chinese counterparts, led by **He Lifeng**, in Switzerland this weekend, aiming to de-escalate the ongoing US-China trade war. **Trump** has also been publicly pressuring Federal Reserve Chair **Jerome Powell** to cut interest rates, a demand **Powell** has resisted, emphasizing the Fed\\'s independence. Canadian Prime Minister **Mark Carney** also recently met with **Trump** amidst these trade tensions.\\n\\nThe announcement of the US-UK deal is a notable move in **Trump\\'s** \"America First\" trade strategy. For the **UK**, under Prime Minister **Keir Starmer**, who had pushed for a deal prior to the tariff blitz, it offers a degree of certainty in a volatile global trade environment. However, the true economic impact and the nature of concessions made by both sides are yet to be fully understood. The broader implications for other trading partners and the global economic order remain a key watchpoint, especially with companies like **Elon Musk\\'s Starlink** reportedly benefiting as nations seek alternatives amidst trade uncertainties.\\n\\n## Economic currents\\n*(No specific stories provided for this section in the current brief)*\\n\\n## Tech & science developments\\n*(No specific stories provided for this section in the current brief beyond what\\'s covered in Main Stories)*\\n\\n## Noteworthy & under-reported\\n\\n<u>**Cities Hoist Pride Flags in Defiance of State Bans**</u>\\n**Salt Lake City, Utah**, and **Boise, Idaho**, have taken symbolic stands against new state laws designed to restrict the display of unofficial flags on government property – laws widely seen by civil rights groups as targeting LGBTQ+ Pride flags. On **May 6**, the **Salt Lake City Council**, with the backing of Mayor **Erin Mendenhall**, adopted three new official city flags: a Pride flag, a Transgender Pride flag, and a Juneteenth flag, all incorporating Utah\\'s state flower, the sego lily. Similarly, **Boise** Mayor **Lauren McLean** issued a proclamation retroactively designating the Pride flag as an official city flag.\\n\\nThese moves are direct responses to **Utah\\'s House Bill 77** (which went into effect **May 7**) and a similar **Idaho** law passed in April. Republican state legislators, such as Utah House Speaker **Mike Schultz** and State Senator **Daniel McCay** (sponsor of HB77), have criticized the cities\\' actions as political theatrics and a waste of taxpayer resources, arguing the state laws aim to keep government spaces neutral. City officials and supporters, however, maintain they are upholding values of diversity and inclusion. The conflict underscores the ongoing cultural clashes between progressive urban centers and more conservative state legislatures.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**Steelers Offload Pickens to Cowboys Amid Behavioral Concerns**</u>\\nThe **Pittsburgh Steelers** have traded wide receiver **George Pickens** and a 2027 sixth-round pick to the **Dallas Cowboys** in exchange for a 2026 third-round pick and a 2027 fifth-round pick. The move comes after the **Steelers** acquired **DK Metcalf** in March and signed him to a five-year deal, making **Pickens** expendable. Concerns over **Pickens\\'** on-field behavior and inconsistent effort, despite his clear talent (leading the league with 18.1 yards per catch in 2023), were reportedly key factors in the **Steelers\\'** decision.\\n\\nThe **Cowboys**, looking to bolster their receiving corps and add a downfield threat alongside **CeeDee Lamb**, moved quickly to acquire **Pickens**. To make roster space, Dallas released wide receiver **Seth Williams**. **Lamb** reacted positively to the trade on social media. For **Pickens**, it\\'s a fresh start under Cowboys head coach **Brian Schottenheimer** and with quarterback **Dak Prescott**, while for the **Steelers** and coach **Mike Tomlin**, it marks the end of a sometimes frustrating relationship with a gifted but volatile player.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**Destiny 2 Charts \"Year of Prophecy\" with \"Edge of Fate\" and \"Renegades\" Expansions**</u>\\nGame developer **Bungie** has unveiled an ambitious roadmap for **Destiny 2**, dubbed the \"Year of Prophecy,\" featuring two new paid expansions. The first, **\"The Edge of Fate,\"** is set to launch on **July 15, 2025**, introducing a new destination called **Kepler**, new abilities, and a storyline centered around the mysterious **Nine**, with characters **Ikora** and newcomer **Lodi** taking prominent roles.\\n\\nFollowing this, **\"Renegades,\"** an expansion explicitly inspired by the Star Wars universe, is slated for release on **December 2, 2025**. While **Bungie** executives like **Justin Truman** insist it remains a \"Destiny story at heart,\" the thematic shift is already drawing mixed reactions from the game\\'s dedicated community, with some fans expressing concern that it might dilute **Destiny 2\\'s** unique identity. The \"Year of Prophecy\" will also include two major free updates, with \"Shadow & Order\" scheduled for March 2026, indicating a sustained content pipeline for the long-running shooter.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**Europa League Final Beckons for Man Utd and Spurs After First-Leg Leads**</u>\\n**Manchester United** and **Tottenham Hotspur** are strongly positioned to contest an all-English Europa League final after securing convincing first-leg victories in their respective semi-finals. **Manchester United**, managed by **Ruben Amorim**, holds a commanding 3-0 advantage over **Athletic Bilbao**, while **Ange Postecoglou\\'s Tottenham** lead Norwegian side **Bodo/Glimt** 3-1.\\n\\nThe second legs, scheduled for **May 8**, present different challenges. **Athletic Bilbao**, under **Ernesto Valverde**, will be severely depleted for their trip to Old Trafford, with key attackers **Inaki Williams**, **Nico Williams**, and **Oihan Sancet** ruled out due to injury, and defender **Dani Vivian** suspended. Despite this, **Valverde** remains hopeful. **Tottenham**, meanwhile, face a tricky away tie at **Bodo/Glimt\\'s Aspmyra Stadion**, known for its artificial pitch, and will be without the influential **James Maddison**, who is out for the rest of the season. **Bodo/Glimt\\'s** manager, **Kjetil Knutsen**, is banking on home advantage. **Amorim**, despite the comfortable lead, has cautioned his **Manchester United** side against complacency, stating that winning the Europa League wouldn\\'t erase a disappointing domestic season.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**PSG Ends Arsenal\\'s Champions League Dream, Sets Up Final with Inter Milan**</u>\\n**Paris Saint-Germain** booked their place in the Champions League final against **Inter Milan** after defeating **Arsenal** 2-1 at the Emirates Stadium, securing a 3-1 aggregate victory in their semi-final clash on **May 7**. Goals from **Fabian Ruiz** and **Achraf Hakimi** for **PSG** overturned an early strike from **Arsenal\\'s Bukayo Saka**.\\n\\n**Arsenal** manager **Mikel Arteta** and his players expressed deep disappointment, with **Arteta** claiming his side was \"the better team for 160 minutes of the tie\" but undone by the \"difference-maker\" performance of **PSG\\'s** goalkeeper, **Gianluigi Donnarumma**, who made several crucial saves. A controversial penalty, conceded by **Arsenal\\'s Myles Lewis-Skelly** for handball and converted by **Vitinha** (though **David Raya** saved the initial shot), also drew criticism. The defeat extends **Arsenal\\'s** five-year trophy drought, though players like **Declan Rice** and **Martin Odegaard** vowed the team would learn and come back stronger. The absence of striker **Gabriel Jesus**, out with a season-ending injury since January, was also cited as a factor. The final will be held in **Munich** on **May 31**. Clashes between **PSG** fans and police were reported before the match.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**Aniston Stalking Suspect Charged After Crashing Bel Air Gate**</u>\\n**Jimmy Wayne Carwyle** faces felony stalking and vandalism charges after an alleged two-year campaign of harassment against actress **Jennifer Aniston** culminated in him crashing his car through the gates of her **Bel Air** home on **May 5, 2025**. **Aniston** was reportedly home at the time but unharmed.\\n\\nAccording to the **Los Angeles County District Attorney\\'s Office**, led by **Nathan Hochman**, **Carwyle**, who reportedly suffers from delusions, had been sending unwanted social media, voicemail, and email messages to **Aniston** since March 2023. After the gate-crashing incident, **Carwyle** was apprehended by **Aniston\\'s** security team and subsequently arrested by the **LAPD**. He was scheduled for arraignment on **May 8** and faces up to three years in prison if convicted. Deputy District Attorney **Sam Hulefeld** of the Stalking and Threat Assessment Team is prosecuting the case.\\n\\n## Positive developments\\n*(No specific stories provided for this section in the current brief)*\\n</brief>\\n\\nCreate a title for the brief.

However, a notable shift is the apparently diminished role of the **United States** in active mediation, a departure from previous crises. This leaves a concerning vacuum, increasing the risk of miscalculation. Both sides are trading accusations, with **India** blaming Pakistan-backed militants like **Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT)** for the **Pahalgam** attack, while **Pakistan** insists the Indian strikes hit civilian areas, not militant infrastructure. The **Resistance Front** claimed responsibility for the initial attack.\\n\\nThe credibility of claims from both sides is, as usual, difficult to verify independently. Domestic political pressures undoubtedly play a role, with both **Modi** and **Sharif**, alongside Pakistan\\'s influential Army Chief **Asim Munir**, needing to project strength. The core issue of **Kashmir** remains the festering wound, and without robust third-party de-escalation efforts, the situation could spiral further. The rhetoric is heated, and the potential for this to escalate beyond retaliatory strikes is uncomfortably high.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**Starmer\\'s Benefit Squeeze: Labour Faces Internal Revolt and Public Ire**</u>\\nThe **Labour** government, helmed by Prime Minister **Keir Starmer**, is navigating treacherous waters as it pushes forward with significant cuts to disability benefits, specifically Personal Independence Payments (**PIP**) and Universal Credit (**UC**), alongside the earlier scrapping of winter fuel payments for most pensioners. These austerity measures, defended by Chancellor **Rachel Reeves** and Disability Minister **Stephen Timms** as fiscally necessary to ensure long-term sustainability and incentivize employment, are provoking a fierce backlash.\\n\\nThe dissent is not merely external. Recent poor local election results, where **Labour** lost 187 council seats, have emboldened a growing faction of **Labour MPs** who are now openly threatening to vote against the proposals. Figures like **Tan Dhesi**, **Ian Byrne**, and **Diane Abbott** are voicing strong opposition, arguing the cuts disproportionately harm the most vulnerable. Even the traditionally supportive **Daily Mirror** has criticized **Starmer\\'s** refusal to reverse the winter fuel payment cuts, signaling a deepening unease.\\n\\nThis internal rebellion presents a significant test of **Starmer\\'s** authority and the government\\'s stability, particularly given its landslide victory last year. The government\\'s argument of fiscal prudence is clashing sharply with accusations of balancing the books on the backs of the vulnerable. This discontent risks alienating core **Labour** voters and provides fertile ground for opposition parties like **Reform UK**, especially in the so-called **Red Wall** constituencies. The government\\'s projected savings of £5bn a year by 2030 are being weighed against the immediate human cost and political damage.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**Vatican Deadlock: Cardinals Struggle to Find Francis\\'s Successor Amidst Division**</u>\\nBlack smoke has billowed from the **Sistine Chapel** chimney for a second consecutive day, signaling that the **133 cardinals** gathered in conclave have yet to reach the required two-thirds majority to elect a successor to **Pope Francis**, who passed away on **April 21, 2025**. The cardinals, sequestered from the outside world, are engaged in multiple daily rounds of voting.\\n\\nThis election is widely viewed as a referendum on **Pope Francis\\'s** often progressive legacy, and the protracted voting underscores deep ideological divisions within the **College of Cardinals**. Conservative and progressive factions are reportedly at odds over the future direction of the Catholic Church. The next pontiff will inherit a complex set of challenges, including strained Vatican finances and the ongoing sexual abuse crisis, issues that demand decisive leadership.\\n\\nWhile names like Italian Cardinal **Pietro Parolin** (Francis\\'s former Secretary of State) and Cardinal **Luis Antonio Tagle** of the Philippines are frequently mentioned as *papabili*, along with others like **Matteo Zuppi** and **Jean-Marc Aveline**, the continued deadlock suggests no single candidate currently commands broad consensus. The longer the process takes, the more apparent these internal schisms become, with significant implications for the 1.4 billion Catholics worldwide and the Church\\'s role on the global stage.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**Australian Election Upset: Polling Failures and Liberal Party Soul-Searching**</u>\\nThe **2025 Australian federal election** delivered a series of surprises, most notably Labor exceeding poll predictions to secure unexpected victories. Labor\\'s **Sarah Witty** unseated Greens leader **Adam Bandt** in Melbourne, and, in a major upset, Labor\\'s **Ali France** defeated Liberal leader **Peter Dutton** in his Queensland seat of Dickson. These results have thrown a harsh spotlight on the accuracy of pre-election polling, with suggestions of \\'herding\\' among pollsters or flawed methodologies underestimating Labor\\'s support.\\n\\nThe **Liberal Party** faces a period of introspection. The loss of its leader and key seats points to significant challenges, including a perceived disconnect with female voters and a lack of female representation within its own ranks. Figures like **Maria Kovacic** are calling for modernization, potentially including quotas, to broaden the party\\'s appeal beyond its traditional base. **Dutton** himself had dismissed concerns about his seat pre-election as a \\'propaganda campaign\\'. The role of organizations like **Climate 200**, which backed an independent in Dickson and shared polling data with Labor, also highlights the shifting dynamics of Australian campaigning.\\n\\nThe post-mortem will undoubtedly focus on why pollsters like **Freshwater Research** (Coalition polling) got it so wrong in Dickson, while others like **Roy Morgan** claim to have better captured the swing to Labor. The preferential voting system always allows for complex outcomes, but the scale of these upsets suggests deeper currents at play than many analysts anticipated.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**Trump Administration\\'s Conservative Push: Nominations, Policy Reversals, and Legal Battles**</u>\\nPresident **Donald Trump** is rapidly reshaping the federal government, advancing a slate of judicial and executive nominations while simultaneously rolling back Biden-era policies. Among the notable nominations is Dr. **Casey Means**, a wellness influencer with \"impeccable MAHA credentials\" according to **Trump**, for Surgeon General. **Matt Anderson** has been nominated for NASA Deputy Administrator, and several conservative jurists, including **Joshua M. Divine** and **Whitney Hermandorfer**, are tapped for federal judgeships.\\n\\nA key policy reversal is the halting of federal funding for electric vehicle charging infrastructure, a program established under the **2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law**. This move has triggered a lawsuit from seventeen states, led by California Attorney General **Rob Bonta**, who argue the decision is illegal and detrimental to transportation modernization and job creation. **Trump** has framed this as supporting **Elon Musk** and **Tesla**, though **Musk** had benefited from the original funding. Concurrently, the administration is seeking to dismiss a lawsuit challenging the **FDA\\'s** deregulation of the abortion pill, a move consistent with its conservative stance on reproductive rights.\\n\\nThese actions, coupled with the firing of Biden-appointed **NTSB** Vice Chair **Alvin Brown**, signal a decisive shift towards conservative priorities across multiple fronts, from environmental policy and healthcare to the composition of the judiciary. The legal challenges to these policy reversals will test the limits of executive power, while the Senate confirmation process for nominees like **Means** will likely be contentious.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**Climate Extremes Bite Harder: Vulnerable Populations and Food Security Under Threat**</u>\\nA confluence of extreme weather events is underscoring the escalating impacts of climate change globally. The **US South**, particularly **New Orleans**, is grappling with heavy rainfall and flooding, while farmers in the **UK** are reporting crop failures due to persistent drought conditions, as highlighted by the **National Farmers\\' Union (NFU)**. These immediate crises are set against a backdrop of grim long-term forecasts, with **AccuWeather** predicting a hotter-than-normal summer with increased hurricane activity in the US, and research from **Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB)** indicating that **Gen Alpha** (children born 2007 or later) will face unprecedented lifetime exposure to climate extremes.\\n\\nGovernment responses are varied and, in some cases, controversial. In the **UK**, the **Advanced Research and Invention Agency (Aria)** has revealed funding for real-world geoengineering experiments, a move defended as vital but one that raises significant ethical and environmental questions. Meanwhile, concerns are being voiced in the US about potential budget cuts to assistance programs like **LIHEAP**, which would disproportionately affect low-income communities already struggling with the impacts of extreme weather.\\n\\nThe signal is clear: climate change is no longer a future threat but a present and intensifying reality. The disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations, threats to food security, and the contentious debate around solutions like geoengineering highlight the complex and urgent challenges ahead. The disconnect between the scientific warnings and, in some quarters, the political will to act decisively remains a critical point of failure.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**AI\\'s Double Edge: Innovation Marches On Amidst Concerns Over Security, Bias, and Critical Thinking**</u>\\nThe rapid proliferation of Artificial Intelligence is forcing a reckoning with its multifaceted impacts. In education, tools like **ChatGPT** are raising concerns about potentially hindering critical thinking skills through \"cognitive offloading,\" as students may rely on AI rather than developing their own analytical abilities. This contrasts with tools like **Khanmigo**, designed to aid, not replace, thinking.\\n\\nSimultaneously, the **UK\\'s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)** is sounding the alarm over AI-enabled cyber threats, warning that AI is expanding attack surfaces and accelerating malicious capabilities, potentially creating a new \"digital divide.\" This security concern is amplified by geopolitical tensions, with **US lawmakers**, including Rep. **Darrell Issa**, investigating allegations of **China\\'s** systematic theft of American AI secrets, potentially through firms like **DeepSeek**, to bolster its own AI supremacy. The **Chinese embassy** has denied these claims as \"groundless.\"\\n\\nEthical considerations also loom large. Research by **InnovateHer**, a UK social enterprise, reveals that girls are more concerned about AI bias than boys, highlighting the risk of reinforcing existing societal inequalities if AI development is not carefully managed. Even practical decisions, such as **NASA\\'s** switch from **Neo4j** to **Memgraph** for its graph database needs due to cost, underscore that the AI revolution has very tangible, and sometimes expensive, infrastructural requirements. The overarching theme is one of immense potential shadowed by significant risks that demand proactive and thoughtful governance.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**Medical Research Blind Spots and Middle East Tinderbox: Women\\'s Health and Gaza Conflict Escalate**</u>\\nTwo distinct but critical issues demand attention: the persistent underrepresentation of women in UK medical trials and the dangerously escalating conflict in **Gaza**. A study by the **Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)** and the **University of Liverpool** found a significant imbalance, with more male-only trials than female-only, raising serious questions about the safety and efficacy of treatments for women. This echoes long-standing concerns, famously highlighted by **Caroline Criado Perez** in \\'Invisible Women\\', about medical research historically defaulting to the male body.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the situation in **Gaza** has deteriorated sharply. Israeli airstrikes have resulted in numerous civilian casualties, reportedly killing at least 48 people, including women and children, according to Palestinian health officials (though figures vary, with the **Hamas-run health ministry** reporting 33 in specific strikes). **Israel**, under Prime Minister **Benjamin Netanyahu**, states its military is preparing to intensify operations against **Hamas** to destroy the group and rescue remaining hostages, following **Hamas\\'s** October 7 attack. **Hamas**, in turn, accuses **Israel** of war crimes and states negotiations are pointless amidst a \"starvation war.\" Hostage negotiations have stalled, and the humanitarian crisis in **Gaza**, with severe shortages of essentials, deepens.\\n\\nAdding another layer of complexity, five Iranian men were arrested in the **UK** on **May 7** for allegedly plotting a terror attack against the Israeli embassy in London. The **Iranian government** has categorically denied involvement. These concurrent crises – one a systemic issue in medical science, the other a geopolitical flashpoint with immediate human cost – highlight profound vulnerabilities and the potential for widespread negative consequences.\\n\\n## United Kingdom focus\\n\\n<u>**Football Regulator Appointment Mired in Political Cronyism Claims**</u>\\nThe nomination of **David Kogan**, a former media executive, as the inaugural chair of the **UK\\'s Independent Football Regulator** has ignited a political firestorm. Scrutiny centers on **Kogan\\'s** past financial donations to **Keir Starmer** and Culture Secretary **Lisa Nandy\\'s** Labour leadership campaigns in 2020, and the unusual recruitment process where he was reportedly headhunted for the role by the permanent secretary of the department after not initially applying.\\n\\nConservative MPs, notably Shadow Minister for Sport **Louie French**, are alleging a \"potential breach of the Governance Code on Public Appointments\" and \"cronyism,\" calling for an investigation. **Kogan**, during a pre-appointment hearing before the **Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee** chaired by **Caroline Dinenage**, admitted to the \"very small sums\" donated but stressed his independence and commitment to making the regulator an \"asset to football, not a \\'cop\\'.\" **Downing Street** and **Starmer\\'s** spokesperson maintain that all rules were followed, and the process was a \"fair and open competition.\"\\n\\nThe **Independent Football Regulator**, being established via the **Football Governance Bill**, is a significant development born from concerns following club collapses like **Bury FC** and the European Super League debacle. It will wield considerable power, including licensing clubs and intervening in financial redistribution between the **Premier League** and the **English Football League (EFL)**. The controversy surrounding **Kogan\\'s** appointment, however, risks undermining the regulator\\'s perceived independence before it even begins its work, a critical factor given the politically charged environment of English football governance.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**UK-India Trade Deal Under Fire as EU Relations Remain Frosty**</u>\\nA newly finalized **UK-India trade deal** is drawing considerable flak, primarily over a provision granting National Insurance (NI) exemptions for up to three years to Indian workers seconded to the **UK**. Critics, including Conservative leader **Kemi Badenoch** (who claims she refused a similar deal as trade secretary) and Reform UK\\'s **Nigel Farage**, argue this creates \"two-tier taxes\" and undercuts British labor, especially as Chancellor **Rachel Reeves** recently raised NI contributions for UK employers. The **Labour** government, through Business Secretary **Jonathan Reynolds**, defends the deal as reciprocal, similar to existing agreements, and beneficial to the UK economy, projecting £4.8bn in gains by 2040.\\n\\nThis trade controversy unfolds against a backdrop of strained **UK-EU** relations. Negotiations for a youth mobility scheme are reportedly mired in disagreement, with the **EU** seeking broader access than the **UK** government, led by European relations minister **Nick Thomas-Symonds**, is willing to concede. **Thomas-Symonds** has stated the **UK** will not return to free movement. These tensions are compounded by warnings from the **Lords Science and Technology Committee** that the **UK\\'s** current visa policy is creating \"unnecessarily high barriers\" to attracting global talent, a concern likely to be addressed in the government\\'s upcoming Immigration White Paper.\\n\\nA planned summit on **May 19** between Prime Minister **Keir Starmer** and European Commission President **Ursula von der Leyen** aims to announce a new security and defense partnership, but the underlying friction on mobility and trade terms persists. The government\\'s balancing act – seeking new global trade partners while managing a complex post-Brexit relationship with the **EU** and addressing domestic concerns about immigration and labor – is proving exceptionally challenging.\\n\\n## Global landscape\\n\\n### Power & politics\\n\\n<u>**US-UK Trade Pact Emerges Amidst Trump\\'s Tariff Barrage and Global Tensions**</u>\\nPresident **Donald Trump** has announced a trade deal with the **United Kingdom**, the first significant agreement since his administration implemented sweeping \"liberation day\" tariffs, including a 10% baseline duty on most countries, in early April. The **UK**, while spared from Trump\\'s \"reciprocal\" tariffs, was subject to this baseline. Details on the scope of the US-UK deal remain somewhat opaque; **Trump** described it as \"full and comprehensive,\" while some reports, citing *The Wall Street Journal*, suggest it may be more of a \"framework\" agreement.\\n\\nThis development occurs as US trade officials, including Treasury Secretary **Scott Bessent** and US Trade Representative **Jamieson Greer**, prepare for talks with Chinese counterparts, led by **He Lifeng**, in Switzerland this weekend, aiming to de-escalate the ongoing US-China trade war. **Trump** has also been publicly pressuring Federal Reserve Chair **Jerome Powell** to cut interest rates, a demand **Powell** has resisted, emphasizing the Fed\\'s independence. Canadian Prime Minister **Mark Carney** also recently met with **Trump** amidst these trade tensions.\\n\\nThe announcement of the US-UK deal is a notable move in **Trump\\'s** \"America First\" trade strategy. For the **UK**, under Prime Minister **Keir Starmer**, who had pushed for a deal prior to the tariff blitz, it offers a degree of certainty in a volatile global trade environment. However, the true economic impact and the nature of concessions made by both sides are yet to be fully understood. The broader implications for other trading partners and the global economic order remain a key watchpoint, especially with companies like **Elon Musk\\'s Starlink** reportedly benefiting as nations seek alternatives amidst trade uncertainties.\\n\\n## Economic currents\\n*(No specific stories provided for this section in the current brief)*\\n\\n## Tech & science developments\\n*(No specific stories provided for this section in the current brief beyond what\\'s covered in Main Stories)*\\n\\n## Noteworthy & under-reported\\n\\n<u>**Cities Hoist Pride Flags in Defiance of State Bans**</u>\\n**Salt Lake City, Utah**, and **Boise, Idaho**, have taken symbolic stands against new state laws designed to restrict the display of unofficial flags on government property – laws widely seen by civil rights groups as targeting LGBTQ+ Pride flags. On **May 6**, the **Salt Lake City Council**, with the backing of Mayor **Erin Mendenhall**, adopted three new official city flags: a Pride flag, a Transgender Pride flag, and a Juneteenth flag, all incorporating Utah\\'s state flower, the sego lily. Similarly, **Boise** Mayor **Lauren McLean** issued a proclamation retroactively designating the Pride flag as an official city flag.\\n\\nThese moves are direct responses to **Utah\\'s House Bill 77** (which went into effect **May 7**) and a similar **Idaho** law passed in April. Republican state legislators, such as Utah House Speaker **Mike Schultz** and State Senator **Daniel McCay** (sponsor of HB77), have criticized the cities\\' actions as political theatrics and a waste of taxpayer resources, arguing the state laws aim to keep government spaces neutral. City officials and supporters, however, maintain they are upholding values of diversity and inclusion. The conflict underscores the ongoing cultural clashes between progressive urban centers and more conservative state legislatures.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**Steelers Offload Pickens to Cowboys Amid Behavioral Concerns**</u>\\nThe **Pittsburgh Steelers** have traded wide receiver **George Pickens** and a 2027 sixth-round pick to the **Dallas Cowboys** in exchange for a 2026 third-round pick and a 2027 fifth-round pick. The move comes after the **Steelers** acquired **DK Metcalf** in March and signed him to a five-year deal, making **Pickens** expendable. Concerns over **Pickens\\'** on-field behavior and inconsistent effort, despite his clear talent (leading the league with 18.1 yards per catch in 2023), were reportedly key factors in the **Steelers\\'** decision.\\n\\nThe **Cowboys**, looking to bolster their receiving corps and add a downfield threat alongside **CeeDee Lamb**, moved quickly to acquire **Pickens**. To make roster space, Dallas released wide receiver **Seth Williams**. **Lamb** reacted positively to the trade on social media. For **Pickens**, it\\'s a fresh start under Cowboys head coach **Brian Schottenheimer** and with quarterback **Dak Prescott**, while for the **Steelers** and coach **Mike Tomlin**, it marks the end of a sometimes frustrating relationship with a gifted but volatile player.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**Destiny 2 Charts \"Year of Prophecy\" with \"Edge of Fate\" and \"Renegades\" Expansions**</u>\\nGame developer **Bungie** has unveiled an ambitious roadmap for **Destiny 2**, dubbed the \"Year of Prophecy,\" featuring two new paid expansions. The first, **\"The Edge of Fate,\"** is set to launch on **July 15, 2025**, introducing a new destination called **Kepler**, new abilities, and a storyline centered around the mysterious **Nine**, with characters **Ikora** and newcomer **Lodi** taking prominent roles.\\n\\nFollowing this, **\"Renegades,\"** an expansion explicitly inspired by the Star Wars universe, is slated for release on **December 2, 2025**. While **Bungie** executives like **Justin Truman** insist it remains a \"Destiny story at heart,\" the thematic shift is already drawing mixed reactions from the game\\'s dedicated community, with some fans expressing concern that it might dilute **Destiny 2\\'s** unique identity. The \"Year of Prophecy\" will also include two major free updates, with \"Shadow & Order\" scheduled for March 2026, indicating a sustained content pipeline for the long-running shooter.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**Europa League Final Beckons for Man Utd and Spurs After First-Leg Leads**</u>\\n**Manchester United** and **Tottenham Hotspur** are strongly positioned to contest an all-English Europa League final after securing convincing first-leg victories in their respective semi-finals. **Manchester United**, managed by **Ruben Amorim**, holds a commanding 3-0 advantage over **Athletic Bilbao**, while **Ange Postecoglou\\'s Tottenham** lead Norwegian side **Bodo/Glimt** 3-1.\\n\\nThe second legs, scheduled for **May 8**, present different challenges. **Athletic Bilbao**, under **Ernesto Valverde**, will be severely depleted for their trip to Old Trafford, with key attackers **Inaki Williams**, **Nico Williams**, and **Oihan Sancet** ruled out due to injury, and defender **Dani Vivian** suspended. Despite this, **Valverde** remains hopeful. **Tottenham**, meanwhile, face a tricky away tie at **Bodo/Glimt\\'s Aspmyra Stadion**, known for its artificial pitch, and will be without the influential **James Maddison**, who is out for the rest of the season. **Bodo/Glimt\\'s** manager, **Kjetil Knutsen**, is banking on home advantage. **Amorim**, despite the comfortable lead, has cautioned his **Manchester United** side against complacency, stating that winning the Europa League wouldn\\'t erase a disappointing domestic season.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**PSG Ends Arsenal\\'s Champions League Dream, Sets Up Final with Inter Milan**</u>\\n**Paris Saint-Germain** booked their place in the Champions League final against **Inter Milan** after defeating **Arsenal** 2-1 at the Emirates Stadium, securing a 3-1 aggregate victory in their semi-final clash on **May 7**. Goals from **Fabian Ruiz** and **Achraf Hakimi** for **PSG** overturned an early strike from **Arsenal\\'s Bukayo Saka**.\\n\\n**Arsenal** manager **Mikel Arteta** and his players expressed deep disappointment, with **Arteta** claiming his side was \"the better team for 160 minutes of the tie\" but undone by the \"difference-maker\" performance of **PSG\\'s** goalkeeper, **Gianluigi Donnarumma**, who made several crucial saves. A controversial penalty, conceded by **Arsenal\\'s Myles Lewis-Skelly** for handball and converted by **Vitinha** (though **David Raya** saved the initial shot), also drew criticism. The defeat extends **Arsenal\\'s** five-year trophy drought, though players like **Declan Rice** and **Martin Odegaard** vowed the team would learn and come back stronger. The absence of striker **Gabriel Jesus**, out with a season-ending injury since January, was also cited as a factor. The final will be held in **Munich** on **May 31**. Clashes between **PSG** fans and police were reported before the match.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<u>**Aniston Stalking Suspect Charged After Crashing Bel Air Gate**</u>\\n**Jimmy Wayne Carwyle** faces felony stalking and vandalism charges after an alleged two-year campaign of harassment against actress **Jennifer Aniston** culminated in him crashing his car through the gates of her **Bel Air** home on **May 5, 2025**. **Aniston** was reportedly home at the time but unharmed.\\n\\nAccording to the **Los Angeles County District Attorney\\'s Office**, led by **Nathan Hochman**, **Carwyle**, who reportedly suffers from delusions, had been sending unwanted social media, voicemail, and email messages to **Aniston** since March 2023. After the gate-crashing incident, **Carwyle** was apprehended by **Aniston\\'s** security team and subsequently arrested by the **LAPD**. He was scheduled for arraignment on **May 8** and faces up to three years in prison if convicted. Deputy District Attorney **Sam Hulefeld** of the Stalking and Threat Assessment Team is prosecuting the case.\\n\\n## Positive developments\\n*(No specific stories provided for this section in the current brief)*\\n</final_brief>\\n\\n**Required Output Format:**\\n\\nYour entire output must consist **only** of a list of summaries, one for each identified major story.

      "## Main Stories\n",
      "\n",
      "<u>**Kashmir Ignites Again: Subcontinental Tensions Spike After Indian Strikes**</u>\n",
      "The fragile peace between **India** and **Pakistan** has shattered following a deadly terrorist attack in **Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir**, on **April 22**, which claimed 26 lives, predominantly tourists. **India**, under Prime Minister **Narendra Modi**, responded on **May 7** with missile strikes against what it termed terrorist training camps across nine sites in **Pakistan** and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. **Pakistan**, led by Prime Minister **Shehbaz Sharif**, condemned these actions as an \"act of war,\" vowing retaliation and claiming to have downed five Indian aircraft – a claim **New Delhi** has not corroborated.\n",
      "\n",
      "The escalation between these two nuclear-armed neighbors has, predictably, drawn international calls for restraint. However, a notable shift is the apparently diminished role of the **United States** in active mediation, a departure from previous crises. This leaves a concerning vacuum, increasing the risk of miscalculation. Both sides are trading accusations, with **India** blaming Pakistan-backed militants like **Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT)** for the **Pahalgam** attack, while **Pakistan** insists the Indian strikes hit civilian areas, not militant infrastructure. The **Resistance Front** claimed responsibility for the initial attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "The credibility of claims from both sides is, as usual, difficult to verify independently. Domestic political pressures undoubtedly play a role, with both **Modi** and **Sharif**, alongside Pakistan's influential Army Chief **Asim Munir**, needing to project strength. The core issue of **Kashmir** remains the festering wound, and without robust third-party de-escalation efforts, the situation could spiral further. The rhetoric is heated, and the potential for this to escalate beyond retaliatory strikes is uncomfortably high.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "<u>**Starmer's Benefit Squeeze: Labour Faces Internal Revolt and Public Ire**</u>\n",
      "The **Labour** government, helmed by Prime Minister **Keir Starmer**, is navigating treacherous waters as it pushes forward with significant cuts to disability benefits, specifically Personal Independence Payments (**PIP**) and Universal Credit (**UC**), alongside the earlier scrapping of winter fuel payments for most pensioners. These austerity measures, defended by Chancellor **Rachel Reeves** and Disability Minister **Stephen Timms** as fiscally necessary to ensure long-term sustainability and incentivize employment, are provoking a fierce backlash.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dissent is not merely external. Recent poor local election results, where **Labour** lost 187 council seats, have emboldened a growing faction of **Labour MPs** who are now openly threatening to vote against the proposals. Figures like **Tan Dhesi**, **Ian Byrne**, and **Diane Abbott** are voicing strong opposition, arguing the cuts disproportionately harm the most vulnerable. Even the traditionally supportive **Daily Mirror** has criticized **Starmer's** refusal to reverse the winter fuel payment cuts, signaling a deepening unease.\n",
      "\n",
      "This internal rebellion presents a significant test of **Starmer's** authority and the government's stability, particularly given its landslide victory last year. The government's argument of fiscal prudence is clashing sharply with accusations of balancing the books on the backs of the vulnerable. This discontent risks alienating core **Labour** voters and provides fertile ground for opposition parties like **Reform UK**, especially in the so-called **Red Wall** constituencies. The government's projected savings of £5bn a year by 2030 are being weighed against the immediate human cost and political damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "<u>**Vatican Deadlock: Cardinals Struggle to Find Francis's Successor Amidst Division**</u>\n",
      "Black smoke has billowed from the **Sistine Chapel** chimney for a second consecutive day, signaling that the **133 cardinals** gathered in conclave have yet to reach the required two-thirds majority to elect a successor to **Pope Francis**, who passed away on **April 21, 2025**. The cardinals, sequestered from the outside world, are engaged in multiple daily rounds of voting.\n",
      "\n",
      "This election is widely viewed as a referendum on **Pope Francis's** often progressive legacy, and the protracted voting underscores deep ideological divisions within the **College of Cardinals**. Conservative and progressive factions are reportedly at odds over the future direction of the Catholic Church. The next pontiff will inherit a complex set of challenges, including strained Vatican finances and the ongoing sexual abuse crisis, issues that demand decisive leadership.\n",
      "\n",
      "While names like Italian Cardinal **Pietro Parolin** (Francis's former Secretary of State) and Cardinal **Luis Antonio Tagle** of the Philippines are frequently mentioned as *papabili*, along with others like **Matteo Zuppi** and **Jean-Marc Aveline**, the continued deadlock suggests no single candidate currently commands broad consensus. The longer the process takes, the more apparent these internal schisms become, with significant implications for the 1.4 billion Catholics worldwide and the Church's role on the global stage.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "<u>**Australian Election Upset: Polling Failures and Liberal Party Soul-Searching**</u>\n",
      "The **2025 Australian federal election** delivered a series of surprises, most notably Labor exceeding poll predictions to secure unexpected victories. Labor's **Sarah Witty** unseated Greens leader **Adam Bandt** in Melbourne, and, in a major upset, Labor's **Ali France** defeated Liberal leader **Peter Dutton** in his Queensland seat of Dickson. These results have thrown a harsh spotlight on the accuracy of pre-election polling, with suggestions of 'herding' among pollsters or flawed methodologies underestimating Labor's support.\n",
      "\n",
      "The **Liberal Party** faces a period of introspection. The loss of its leader and key seats points to significant challenges, including a perceived disconnect with female voters and a lack of female representation within its own ranks. Figures like **Maria Kovacic** are calling for modernization, potentially including quotas, to broaden the party's appeal beyond its traditional base. **Dutton** himself had dismissed concerns about his seat pre-election as a 'propaganda campaign'. The role of organizations like **Climate 200**, which backed an independent in Dickson and shared polling data with Labor, also highlights the shifting dynamics of Australian campaigning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The post-mortem will undoubtedly focus on why pollsters like **Freshwater Research** (Coalition polling) got it so wrong in Dickson, while others like **Roy Morgan** claim to have better captured the swing to Labor. The preferential voting system always allows for complex outcomes, but the scale of these upsets suggests deeper currents at play than many analysts anticipated.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "<u>**Trump Administration's Conservative Push: Nominations, Policy Reversals, and Legal Battles**</u>\n",
      "President **Donald Trump** is rapidly reshaping the federal government, advancing a slate of judicial and executive nominations while simultaneously rolling back Biden-era policies. Among the notable nominations is Dr. **Casey Means**, a wellness influencer with \"impeccable MAHA credentials\" according to **Trump**, for Surgeon General. **Matt Anderson** has been nominated for NASA Deputy Administrator, and several conservative jurists, including **Joshua M. Divine** and **Whitney Hermandorfer**, are tapped for federal judgeships.\n",

      "A key policy reversal is the halting of federal funding for electric vehicle charging infrastructure, a program established under the **2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law**. This move has triggered a lawsuit from seventeen states, led by California Attorney General **Rob Bonta**, who argue the decision is illegal and detrimental to transportation modernization and job creation. **Trump** has framed this as supporting **Elon Musk** and **Tesla**, though **Musk** had benefited from the original funding. Concurrently, the administration is seeking to dismiss a lawsuit challenging the **FDA's** deregulation of the abortion pill, a move consistent with its conservative stance on reproductive rights.\n",

      "These actions, coupled with the firing of Biden-appointed **NTSB** Vice Chair **Alvin Brown**, signal a decisive shift towards conservative priorities across multiple fronts, from environmental policy and healthcare to the composition of the judiciary. The legal challenges to these policy reversals will test the limits of executive power, while the Senate confirmation process for nominees like **Means** will likely be contentious.\n",

      "A confluence of extreme weather events is underscoring the escalating impacts of climate change globally. The **US South**, particularly **New Orleans**, is grappling with heavy rainfall and flooding, while farmers in the **UK** are reporting crop failures due to persistent drought conditions, as highlighted by the **National Farmers' Union (NFU)**. These immediate crises are set against a backdrop of grim long-term forecasts, with **AccuWeather** predicting a hotter-than-normal summer with increased hurricane activity in the US, and research from **Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB)** indicating that **Gen Alpha** (children born 2007 or later) will face unprecedented lifetime exposure to climate extremes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Government responses are varied and, in some cases, controversial. In the **UK**, the **Advanced Research and Invention Agency (Aria)** has revealed funding for real-world geoengineering experiments, a move defended as vital but one that raises significant ethical and environmental questions. Meanwhile, concerns are being voiced in the US about potential budget cuts to assistance programs like **LIHEAP**, which would disproportionately affect low-income communities already struggling with the impacts of extreme weather.\n",
      "\n",
      "The signal is clear: climate change is no longer a future threat but a present and intensifying reality. The disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations, threats to food security, and the contentious debate around solutions like geoengineering highlight the complex and urgent challenges ahead.

      "The rapid proliferation of Artificial Intelligence is forcing a reckoning with its multifaceted impacts. In education, tools like **ChatGPT** are raising concerns about potentially hindering critical thinking skills through \"cognitive offloading,\" as students may rely on AI rather than developing their own analytical abilities. This contrasts with tools like **Khanmigo**, designed to aid, not replace, thinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Simultaneously, the **UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)** is sounding the alarm over AI-enabled cyber threats, warning that AI is expanding attack surfaces and accelerating malicious capabilities, potentially creating a new \"digital divide.\" This security concern is amplified by geopolitical tensions, with **US lawmakers**, including Rep. **Darrell Issa**, investigating allegations of **China's** systematic theft of American AI secrets, potentially through firms like **DeepSeek**, to bolster its own AI supremacy. The **Chinese embassy** has denied these claims as \"groundless.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ethical considerations also loom large. Research by **InnovateHer**, a UK social enterprise, reveals that girls are more concerned about AI bias than boys, highlighting the risk of reinforcing existing societal inequalities if AI development is not carefully managed. Even practical decisions, such as **NASA's** switch from **Neo4j** to **Memgraph** for its graph database needs due to cost, underscore that the AI revolution has very tangible, and sometimes expensive, infrastructural requirements.

A study by the **Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)** and the **University of Liverpool** found a significant imbalance, with more male-only trials than female-only, raising serious questions about the safety and efficacy of treatments for women. This echoes long-standing concerns, famously highlighted by **Caroline Criado Perez** in 'Invisible Women', about medical research historically defaulting to the male body.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, the situation in **Gaza** has deteriorated sharply. Israeli airstrikes have resulted in numerous civilian casualties, reportedly killing at least 48 people, including women and children, according to Palestinian health officials (though figures vary, with the **Hamas-run health ministry** reporting 33 in specific strikes). **Israel**, under Prime Minister **Benjamin Netanyahu**, states its military is preparing to intensify operations against **Hamas** to destroy the group and rescue remaining hostages, following **Hamas's** October 7 attack. **Hamas**, in turn, accuses **Israel** of war crimes and states negotiations are pointless amidst a \"starvation war.\" Hostage negotiations have stalled, and the humanitarian crisis in **Gaza**, with severe shortages of essentials, deepens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adding another layer of complexity, five Iranian men were arrested in the **UK** on **May 7** for allegedly plotting a terror attack against the Israeli embassy in London. The **Iranian government** has categorically denied involvement.

Scrutiny centers on **Kogan's** past financial donations to **Keir Starmer** and Culture Secretary **Lisa Nandy's** Labour leadership campaigns in 2020, and the unusual recruitment process where he was reportedly headhunted for the role by the permanent secretary of the department after not initially applying.\n",

      "Conservative MPs, notably Shadow Minister for Sport **Louie French**, are alleging a \"potential breach of the Governance Code on Public Appointments\" and \"cronyism,\" calling for an investigation. **Kogan**, during a pre-appointment hearing before the **Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee** chaired by **Caroline Dinenage**, admitted to the \"very small sums\" donated but stressed his independence and commitment to making the regulator an \"asset to football, not a 'cop'.\" **Downing Street** and **Starmer's** spokesperson maintain that all rules were followed, and the process was a \"fair and open competition.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The **Independent Football Regulator**, being established via the **Football Governance Bill**, is a significant development born from concerns following club collapses like **Bury FC** and the European Super League debacle. It will wield considerable power, including licensing clubs and intervening in financial redistribution between the **Premier League** and the **English Football League (EFL)**.

Critics, including Conservative leader **Kemi Badenoch** (who claims she refused a similar deal as trade secretary) and Reform UK's **Nigel Farage**, argue this creates \"two-tier taxes\" and undercuts British labor, especially as Chancellor **Rachel Reeves** recently raised NI contributions for UK employers. The **Labour** government, through Business Secretary **Jonathan Reynolds**, defends the deal as reciprocal, similar to existing agreements, and beneficial to the UK economy, projecting £4.8bn in gains by 2040.\n",
      "\n",
      "This trade controversy unfolds against a backdrop of strained **UK-EU** relations. Negotiations for a youth mobility scheme are reportedly mired in disagreement, with the **EU** seeking broader access than the **UK** government, led by European relations minister **Nick Thomas-Symonds**, is willing to concede. **Thomas-Symonds** has stated the **UK** will not return to free movement. These tensions are compounded by warnings from the **Lords Science and Technology Committee** that the **UK's** current visa policy is creating \"unnecessarily high barriers\" to attracting global talent, a concern likely to be addressed in the government's upcoming Immigration White Paper.\n",

The **UK**, while spared from Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs, was subject to this baseline. Details on the scope of the US-UK deal remain somewhat opaque; **Trump** described it as \"full and comprehensive,\" while some reports, citing *The Wall Street Journal*, suggest it may be more of a \"framework\" agreement.\n",

      "This development occurs as US trade officials, including Treasury Secretary **Scott Bessent** and US Trade Representative **Jamieson Greer**, prepare for talks with Chinese counterparts, led by **He Lifeng**, in Switzerland this weekend, aiming to de-escalate the ongoing US-China trade war. **Trump** has also been publicly pressuring Federal Reserve Chair **Jerome Powell** to cut interest rates, a demand **Powell** has resisted, emphasizing the Fed's independence. Canadian Prime Minister **Mark Carney** also recently met with **Trump** amidst these trade tensions.\n",

On **May 6**, the **Salt Lake City Council**, with the backing of Mayor **Erin Mendenhall**, adopted three new official city flags: a Pride flag, a Transgender Pride flag, and a Juneteenth flag, all incorporating Utah's state flower, the sego lily. Similarly, **Boise** Mayor **Lauren McLean** issued a proclamation retroactively designating the Pride flag as an official city flag.\n",
