<p class="has-text-align-none">The White House is working to “improve Wi-Fi connectivity,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement emailed to <em>The Verge</em>. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/us/politics/elon-musk-starlink-white-house.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share">According to <em>The New York Times</em></a>, it’s using Starlink to address the issue, which White House officials blame on the property’s spotty cell service and “overtaxed” Wi-Fi infrastructure.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Huh. Giving Leavitt the benefit of the doubt, I’ll grant that you can connect to Starlink terminals, like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24275688/starlink-mini-review-battery-powered-backpack-comparison">Starlink Mini we reviewed last year</a>, directly over Wi-Fi. But that’s apparently not what’s happening here, despite the efforts of a SpaceX security engineer named Chris Stanley, who the <em>Times</em> says “went to the roof of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in the White House complex to explore installing Starlink there,” only to trip a Secret Service alarm. Instead, the outlet writes that the White House is having its Starlink service piped from a government data center miles from the compound.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Let’s set aside the obvious conflict of interest and ethics questions at play here — Elon Musk, who owns Starlink parent company SpaceX, has seemed to have his <a href="https://www.theverge.com/elon-musk/609164/auto-draft">hand on the Executive Branch’s till</a> a lot since Trump took over as President. We can even skip over the security implications pointed out by a cybersecurity expert in the <em>Times </em>piece. As a practical matter alone, there’s no obvious reason to add another ISP in order to improve Wi-Fi coverage, especially one that the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/12/23999070/spacex-starlink-fcc-rural-digital-opportunity-fund-fcc-rejected">FCC said less than two years ago</a> didn’t “demonstrate that it could deliver the promised service” required for rural broadband funding. The much simpler solution would be running some new ethernet cable or adding a few extra Wi-Fi access points, like routers. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">White House officials said Starlink has “donated” the service, the <em>Times</em> writes. Okay, free is free, hard to knock that. If we want to be really generous, maybe the White House is getting The Good Starlink that the rest of us don’t have access to. You know, like that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17979502/trump-super-tivo-directv-state-of-the-art">“state-of-the-art Super TiVo”</a> the first Trump White House claimed to have in 2018.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Even then</em>, this is a connection that’s beamed from space, through ever-changing atmospheric conditions, with all the stability implications that brings. Piping it in over fiber from a distant data center doesn’t change that. Starlink is good for what it is — the best, even! It just doesn’t stack up against a solid, hardwired internet connection.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A Google-backed mission to detect wildfires from space launched a prototype satellite last week, which is now communicating with its developers on Earth.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s the first of at least 50 planned for a constellation of satellites called FireSat. The initiative is led by the nonprofit coalition <a href="https://www.earthfirealliance.org/press-release/protoflight-launch">Earth Fire Alliance</a>, along with startup <a href="https://www.muonspace.com/press/muon-space-deploys-firesat-protoflight-marking-a-major-milestone-in-global-wildfire-monitoring">Muon Space</a>, which designs and operates satellite networks. The initiative got <a href="http://google.org">$13 million from Google.org</a> as well as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/16/24243996/fire-satellite-google-firesat-constellation">technical support from the Google Research team</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The devastating wildfires in Los Angeles earlier this year underscore the urgent need for real-time, high-fidelity infrared data to protect lives, communities, ecosystems, and economies,” Brian Collins, executive director of the alliance, said yesterday in a <a href="https://www.earthfirealliance.org/press-release/protoflight-launch">press release</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“The devastating wildfires in Los Angeles earlier this year underscore the urgent need for real-time, high-fidelity infrared data”</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Once it’s fully up and running, FireSat could give people much earlier warning than existing technology has allowed in the past. The FireSat constellation is expected to be able to detect fires as small as 5 x 5 meters (the size of a classroom). Earlier satellites couldn’t see blazes until they had grown to two to three acres in size (the size of two football fields), according to Google. To get a higher resolution, FireSat developers created custom sensors and algorithms to crunch the data using AI.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">People and planes often flag wildfires before satellites do, but satellites can play a critical role when it comes to monitoring more rural areas. And wildfires have <a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/global-trends-forest-fires">become more widespread</a> as climate change creates more hot and arid conditions in parts of the world <a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/wildfires-climate-change">including California</a>, where Google is headquartered. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first FireSat launch took place in Vandenberg Space Force Base in California on March 14th. Three more satellites are scheduled to launch in 2026. Together, they’ll be able to check every point on Earth at least twice each day. “Key wildfire-prone regions” will be monitored more frequently, <a href="https://www.muonspace.com/press/muon-space-and-earth-fire-alliance-unveil-firesat-constellation-a-revolutionary-space-mission-to-transform-global-wildfire-response?utm_source=pocket_shared">according to Muon Space</a>. The entire constellation of more than 50 satellites is scheduled to become fully operational in 2030, providing updates at least every 20 minutes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Accessory maker Elecom has <a href="https://www.elecom.co.jp/news/new/20250313-01/">announced what it’s claiming to be</a> the first consumer-ready power bank that uses a sodium-ion battery instead of a lithium-ion one, <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Elecom-launches-world-s-first-sodium-ion-mobile-power-bank.978777.0.html">as spotted by <em>Notebookcheck</em></a>. In addition to being <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24194493/forever-chemicals-pfas-lithium-ion-ev-rechargeable-batteries">more environmentally friendly</a> to manufacture, the 9,000mAh Na Plus can be used in extreme temperatures with less risk of overheating, and has — Elecom claims — a lifespan of almost 5,000 charges. Even if you’re recharging it every single day, after 13 years it should still be providing power.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sodium-ion battery technology is new compared to lithium-ion tech, and production capacities haven’t reached the level of lithium-ion batteries. So while a little deal-hunting can get you a basic 10,000mAh lithium-ion power bank from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Charger-Charging-Battery/dp/B0CZ9M6X8Q/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?th=1">companies like Anker for less than $20</a>, the <a href="https://www.elecom.co.jp/pickup/contents/00113/">Na Plus is debuting in Japan</a> (in black and light gray color options) for 9,980 yen, or around $67. Elecom hasn’t yet announced a wider rollout.</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/elecom_4.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,9.9807426129867,100,80.038514774027" alt="The Elecom Na Plus power bank pictured in black and light gray color options." title="The Elecom Na Plus power bank pictured in black and light gray color options." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;The Elecom Na Plus offers basic power bank functionality with a single USB-C and USB-A port.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Elecom" data-portal-copyright="Image: Elecom" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Power output maxes out at 45W through a single USB-C port, or 18W through the Na Plus’ lone USB-A port. A series of LEDs can be used to determine the power bank’s remaining power level, and it takes about two hours to fully charge it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Performance-wise, the Na Plus definitely isn’t the most capable portable charger you can buy. What’s inside is what’s most exciting. Although lithium-ion technology has dominated batteries since the early ‘90s, lithium isn’t an unlimited resource, and mining it (as well as other metals used in batteries like cobalt and nickel) involves energy-intensive processes that can pollute local ecosystems.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sodium-ion batteries —&nbsp;like the name might suggest —&nbsp;function similarly to lithium-ion ones, but with sodium instead of lithium. Sodium is more abundantly available and much easier to produce. Sodium-ion batteries are also safer to use. Elecom says the Na Plus can operate in temperatures ranging from around -30 to 122 degrees Fahrenheit and is at less risk of fires caused by overheating and thermal runaway.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The price tag on this technology might drop in the future as the supply chain expands and production increases. But doing those things likely won’t solve this other drawback: sodium-ion batteries are simply bigger all around.&nbsp; These batteries have a lower energy density compared to lithium-based batteries, meaning they have to be larger and heavier to store an equivalent amount of energy. Case in point: that 10,000mAh lithium battery from Anker weighs around 213 grams, while the 9,000mAh Na Plus is 350 grams and much bulkier.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sodium-ion batteries might be better suited for applications where size isn’t the primary concern, such as storage systems for renewable energy sources, backup power supplies, or powering vehicles like cargo ships. The Na Plus might be bulky and expensive, but it’s still exciting to see this technology finally reach consumers.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/27/23184519/elon-musk-twitter-acquisition-deal-complete-agreement">Elon Musk bought Twitter</a>, and now he&rsquo;s rebranding it as X. Signs have gone up (<a href="http://www.theverge.com/e/23578517">and back down</a>), icons are changing, and an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23814989/elon-musk-banking-x-paypal">old plan</a> is new.</p>

<p>How&rsquo;d we get here?</p>

<p>On April 4th, 2022, we learned that Musk had purchased enough shares of Twitter to become its largest individual shareholder. Eventually, he followed up with an unsolicited offer to buy 100 percent of Twitter&rsquo;s shares for $54.20 each, or about $44 billion.  Twitter&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/25/23028323/elon-musk-twitter-offer-buyout-hostile-takeover-ownership">accepted Musk&rsquo;s offer</a>, but then things got weird because <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/8/23200961/elon-musk-files-back-out-twitter-deal-breach-of-contract">he tried to cancel the deal</a>.</p>

<p>There was a lot of back-and-forth about bots and text messages, but in the end, Musk settled on buying the company rather than facing a deposition or Chancery Court trial and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CkRAho3AqtN/">eventually strode into Twitter HQ carrying a sink</a>.</p>

<p>Since then, there have been layoffs, more layoffs, and even more layoffs &mdash; plus drama over <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/10/23678105/elon-musk-substack-notes-battle-matt-taibbi">Substack</a>, unpaid bills, and blue checkmarks. With ad revenue still down from previous years, Elon finally abdicated the role of CEO in May 2023, installing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/12/23721107/twitter-ceo-linda-yaccarino-elon-musk-nbc">longtime NBCUniversal ad executive Linda Yaccarino</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Frida Baby is upgrading a popular tool designed to help relieve an infant’s congestion with more power. The company says it sells over 4.7 million of its manual <a href="https://frida.com/products/nosefrida">SnotSuckers</a> every year, but for parents who are too grossed out at the thought of manually sucking snot out of a sick infant’s nose, the new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Frida-Baby-NoseFrida-Pro-Congestion/dp/B0DSM19DGB">$79.97 Electric NoseFrida Pro nasal aspirator</a> does it automatically and more powerfully than the company&#8217;s other electric option.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>The Verge</em>’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23670286/electric-baby-snot-sucker-nose-frida">Allison Johnson has already thoroughly explained why sucking snot</a> out of a baby or toddler’s nose is as important a task as it is an unpleasant one. A stuffed-up nose is not just uncomfortable for a child; it can also make it hard for them to eat, drink, and sleep.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The NoseFrida SnotSucker comes highly recommended in parenting communities, but it’s a finicky device that requires a lot of manual suction and — more often than not — two adults to get the job done. The company already offers an easier-to-use <a href="https://frida.com/products/electric-nosefrida-1">electric version for $39.99</a>, and other companies sell similar products. But Frida Baby says its new ENF Pro introduces two additional levels of suction power comparable to “hospital-grade neonatal aspirators.”</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/enfpro_3.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.771144658312,100,78.457710683376" alt="A spill shot of the Frida Baby Electric NoseFrida Pro and its carrying case." title="A spill shot of the Frida Baby Electric NoseFrida Pro and its carrying case." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;A carrying case is included, and while the ENF Pro charges over USB-C, you’ll need to provide your own AC adapter.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Frida Baby" data-portal-copyright="Image: Frida Baby" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Frida Baby hasn’t shared details on how much suction that actually equates to, but Dr. Noze Best, a company that also sells a hospital-grade solution, <a href="https://drnozebest.ca/blogs/the-doctor-is-in/why-not-to-use-a-breast-pump-as-a-suctioning-device-for-a-nasal-aspirator">says the suction strength of its NozeBot is 585 mmHg</a>, while devices like breast pumps are closer to 270 mmHg. What sets the ENF Pro apart from the NozeBot is that it’s an FDA-approved medical device that “meets stricter standards for safety and effectiveness than typical consumer-grade aspirators,” according to the company.</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/enfpro_2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="The Electric NoseFrida Pro being used to remove snot from an infant’s nose." title="The Electric NoseFrida Pro being used to remove snot from an infant’s nose." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;The Electric NoseFrida Pro includes two swappable tips designed for infants and older children.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Frida Baby" data-portal-copyright="Image: Frida Baby" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The process of clearing a congested infant’s nose can be stressful, especially for new parents when a child is already crying. To ease some of the discomfort of the process, the ENF Pro includes a soft tip that’s gentler for smaller noses, and a more rigid alternative that offers improved suction for older kids. An added finger loop facilitates one-handed operation, and all the parts that actually come into contact with nasal passages and snot can be washed in the dishwasher, so cleanup is mostly hands-off.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Friday Baby says the ENF Pro can run for up to two hours on its rechargeable battery but doesn’t specify if that’s at full power or using one of the lower options of its five variable suction settings. It charges using the included USB-C cable, but you’ll need to provide an AC adapter or some other source of USB power.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Evan Feinman is out as the director of the $42.5 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program, reports <em>ProPublica</em>’s Craig Silverman <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/craigsilverman.bsky.social/post/3lkiybhzma22p">in a Bluesky post today</a>. BEAD aims to bring high-bandwidth internet to underserved areas of America, much of which is rural. Silverman <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/craigsilverman.bsky.social/post/3lkiye5n2dk2p">shared screenshots</a> from a department-wide email Feinman sent on Friday, in which he warned there would be “deeply negative outcomes” if the program shifts from fiber build-outs to using satellite-based internet like that which Elon Musk’s Starlink offers. “Feinman’s term ended and he was not reappointed,” Silverman writes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This month, Commerce Department Secretary Howard Lutnick <a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDOC/bulletins/3d56db2">announced a “rigorous review” of the program</a>, which he said “has not connected a single person to the internet,” something he blamed on “woke mandates, favoritism towards certain technologies, and burdensome regulations.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">BEAD was introduced as part of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783684/biden-infrastructure-bill-bipartisan-broadband-ev-electrical-grid-climate">$1 trillion Biden-era infrastructure spending bill</a>. The program offers $42.5 billion in grants to states to use toward building out internet infrastructure that would provide at least a 100Mbps down and 20Mbps up connection to underserved parts of the country. The program prioritizes fiber-based internet, but allows for other kinds where fiber isn’t proven to be tenable.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Getting from the start of the program to actual network buildouts has been a long, multi-step process that started with the FCC <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/18/23466705/fcc-new-broadband-maps-internet-united-states">making a map of US broadband access</a> and moves through state proposals, challenges to the FCC’s map, and selection of ISPs that will be paid to build new service. According to the<a href="https://www.internetforall.gov/bead-progress-dashboard"> government BEAD progress-tracking site</a>, three states — Delaware, Louisiana, and Nevada — had made it to the last step of issuing a final proposal for public comment before the site stopped being updated regularly.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lutnick’s announcement mirrors much of Republicans’ ongoing backlash to the program, some of whom say that Biden had blocked Starlink from being part of it for political reasons, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/technology/broadband-rules-elon-musk-starlink.html"><em>The New York</em> <em>Times</em> wrote</a> on March 5th. The <em>Times</em> notes FCC denials, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/12/23999070/spacex-starlink-fcc-rural-digital-opportunity-fund-fcc-rejected">most recently in 2023</a>, that kept Musk’s company from getting $886 million in Universal Service Fund subsidies for a separate rural broadband program. The FCC said said the company couldn’t “demonstrate that it could deliver the promised service.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The rules that Lutnick may propose could benefit Musk’s company, which was “expected to get up to $4.1 billion” under the BEAD program’s initial rules, according to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/commerce-to-overhaul-internet-for-all-plan-expanding-starlink-funding-prospects-74664efc?st=gb1nTZ"><em>The</em> <em>Wall Street Journal</em></a> in March. The outlet said Starlink  could get as much as $20 billion under Lutnick’s overhaul of the program.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In his outgoing staff email, Feinman wrote that the overhaul could strand “all or part of rural America with worse internet so that we can make the world’s richest man even richer,” adding that it would be “yet another in a long line of betrayals by Washington.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the quotes from the email below, Feinman writes what he says will “definitely happen” next.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">1. Removing the “woke” requirements from the program. This will include all provisions related to labor and wage, climate resiliency, middle class affordability, etc. I do not regard the inclusion or removal of these provisions as significant; they were inserted by the prior administration for messaging/political purposes, and were never central to the mission of the program, nor were they significant in the actual conduct of the program.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">2. A “pause” that isn’t a pause. The administration wants to make changes, but doesn’t want to be seen slowing things down. They can’t have both. States will have to be advised that they should either slow down or stop doing subgrantee selection.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">3. Some kind of limit on spending, per location. This could be fine. There weren’t any cases of a state planning to spend hundreds of thousands to connect one location anyway. However, if it’s heavy handed or imposed in a manner that ignores the needs of rural communities, it could be very bad &#8211; more on that below.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">4. Changes to the treatment of fiber and satellite. Generally, even though the law pretty clearly requires that fiber builds be the program’s “priority projects,” the administration wants to increase the usage of low-earth satellites and diminish the usage of fiber.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">5. The NTIA team will try to persuade the administration to embrace the best version of their chosen direction, and the BEAD team &#8211; especially the program officers out in the states &#8211; will do everything they can to support the states in conducting the program and dealing with changes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He goes on to list what he considers are likely impacts of the changes.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">1. Delays in getting broadband to the people. Some states are on the 1 yard line. A bunch are on the 5 yard line. More will be getting there every week. These more-sweeping changes will only cause delays. The administration could fix the problems with the program via waiver and avoid slowdowns. Shovels could already be in the ground in three states, and they could be in the ground in half the country by the summer without the proposed changes to project selection.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">2. More people will get Starlink/Kuiper, and fewer people will get fiber connection. This could be dramatic, or it could be measured, depending on where the admin sets the threshold limit, and whether states are permitted to award projects above the new threshold on the basis of value per dollar, or if they&#8217;re forced to take the cheapest proposal, even if it provides poorer service.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">3. The 3 states with approved Final Proposals remain in limbo. They are currently held in NIST review regarding their proposed FPFRs (the budgets accompanying their approved final proposals).</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">This makes no sense &#8211; these states are ready to go, and they got the job done on time, on budget, and have plans that achieve universal coverage. If the administration cares about getting shovels in the ground, states with approved Final Proposals should move forward, ASAP.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">4. West Virginia (and soon additional states) who have completed their work, but don&#8217;t have approved Final Proposals also remain in limbo. They have a final proposal ready to go that gets exceptional service to all West Virginia homes and businesses. Like the three states with approved Final Proposals, only the current administration stands between them and getting shovels in the ground. If the administration cares about getting things done, they should allow any state that comes forward with a Final Proposal under the old rules in the next couple of months move forward with that plan.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">5. No decision has been made about how much of the existing progress the 30 states who are already performing subgrantee selection should be allowed to keep. The administration simply cannot say whether the time, taxpayer funds, and private capital that were spent on those processes will be wasted and how much states will have to re-do.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">6. The wireless industry will be, effectively, shut out of the BEAD program. There will be few, if any, locations that are above any new cost limit that will be able to be more cheaply served by fixed wireless than low earth satellites.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You can read the remainder of the email in Silverman’s screenshots below.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Trump administration launched a massive deregulation spree that could gut environmental and health protections in the US, moves that are sure to face immediate legal and logistical challenges.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wednesday was “the greatest day of deregulation our nation has seen,” Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lee Zeldin said in a <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-launches-biggest-deregulatory-action-us-history">press release</a>. The proposed changes include 31 actions to roll back pollution regulations for power plants, oil and gas refineries, chemical plants, cars and trucks, factories, and more.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“This is a cluster bomb”</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Advocacy groups, unsurprisingly, are already promising a fight. Outside of court, the EPA — if it follows protocol — would have to go through extensive rulemaking processes. And it has to make this all happen with a shrunken and demoralized workforce.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This is a cluster bomb of moves to demolish a broad swath of environmental regulations. We’ll see if it explodes in EPA’s face when the inevitable barrage of lawsuits hits the courts,” Michael Gerrard, faculty director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, said in an email to <em>The Verge</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The EPA says it will “reconsider” a broad swath of regulations on everything including mercury, toxic air pollutants, soot, wastewater, the chemicals used in the workplace, and the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The EPA is also working to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/612212/clean-energy-funding-gold-epa-lee-zeldin-trump">claw back $20 billion</a> of Biden-era federal funding to reduce greenhouse gas pollution. Zeldin’s language when it comes to the climate crisis is particularly vociferous. “We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion to drive down cost of living for American families, unleash American energy, bring auto jobs back to the U.S. and more,” he said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The EPA press release says, without sharing any numbers or analysis, that the proposed measures would make it more affordable to buy a car or run a business. The Trump administration&#8217;s tariff wars, however, are expected to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/624812/trump-tariff-car-price-increase-production-cut">raise the cost of a car by up to $12,000</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Federal standards for soot pollution alone, on the other hand, are estimated to lead to $46 billion in net health benefits, according to an <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-finalizes-stronger-standards-harmful-soot-pollution-significantly-increasing#:~:text=By%20strengthening%20the%20annual%20health,to%204%2C500%20premature%20deaths%20and">EPA analysis</a> last year. Stronger soot protections that were finalized last year were also expected to prevent 290,000 lost workdays and 4,500 premature deaths by 2032. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">American Lung Association president and CEO Harold Wimmer said in an emailed statement that the organization “will use every tool in our toolbox to defend these lifesaving protections and protect the health of families.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Sierra Club also said in a statement that it would “fight these outrageous rollbacks tooth and nail.” And “should the EPA undo settled law and irrefutable facts, we expect to see this administration in court,” environmental law organization Earthjustice said in another statement.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It is important to remember that currently, all these clean air protections are still in place. EPA’s leadership can’t undo them with this announcement. They have to follow the law and go through a process to reconsider or revoke them,” the American Lung Association’s Wimmer added.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President Donald Trump managed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks-list.html">roll back around 100 environmental regulations</a> during his first term in office. This time around, he’s moving much quicker to enact sweeping changes. But the wrecking ball that Trump and billionaire ally Elon Musk have taken to federal agencies could also make it harder to implement their agenda at the EPA.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“In order to revoke or revise a regulation, you need a new regulation,” Columbia’s Gerrard notes. It takes skilled staff to write detailed explanations to justify such drastic changes in the EPA’s position, according to Gerrard. Courts could invalidate new rules without those explanations, and it’s unclear who would be left at the agency to do that work as the Trump administration slashes the federal workforce, he says.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In February, the EPA notified 1,100 probationary workers that they could be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/605611/trump-elon-musk-federal-government-employee">terminated immediately</a>. The agency has already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/11/us/politics/trump-musk-doge-federal-workers.html">fired hundreds of staffers</a>. Trump has also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/climate/trump-epa-layoffs.html">floated and walked back the idea of cutting 65 percent</a> of the agency’s staff. And the EPA’s actions announced this week include “terminating Biden’s environmental justice and DEI arms of the agency” — encompassing roles that address the ways in which <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39797-4#:~:text=Low%2Dincome%20groups%20tend%20to,health%20care%2C%20increasing%20mortality%20rates.">low-income communities</a> and <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1818859116">Americans of color</a> are often <a href="https://www.lung.org/research/sota/key-findings">disproportionately exposed to pollution</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The announcements made yesterday mark “the most disastrous day in EPA history,” according to an emailed statement from former EPA administrator and White House national climate adviser Gina McCarthy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“They’re doing the bidding of their fossil fuel friends,” McCarthy said. Trump received more than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/climate/oil-gas-donations-trump.html">$75 million from oil and gas interests</a> while campaigning on a platform to <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/2024-republican-party-platform">“drill, baby, drill.”</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to McCarthy, “The agency has fully abdicated its mission to protect Americans’ health and wellbeing.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a first for the US, wind and solar produced more electricity than coal last year, according to a new <a href="https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/us-electricity-2025-special-report/">report</a> from energy think tank Ember. Coal fell to a historic low, generating 15 percent of the country’s electricity compared to 17 percent from solar and wind combined.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The federal government is now taking a sharp turn away from clean energy under the Trump administration. But the gains made last year show the market forces at play could keep momentum going despite President Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-records-3-hour-podcast-interview-joe-rogan-rcna177288">disdain for windmills</a> and <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/epa-cuts-off-ira-solar-money-already-under-contract/">solar panels</a>.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><strong>“Solar is winning</strong>.”</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Solar was the fastest-growing source of electricity in 2024, according to data from the US Energy Information Administration. It accounted for 81 percent of added annual capacity. Utility scale solar grew by a record 31 gigawatts. For context, a single gigawatt of power is comparable to <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/how-much-power-1-gigawatt">1.9 million</a> photovoltaic panels.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Solar energy reached <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514902/solar-energy-cost-historic-low-energy-agency-outlook-2020">historically low costs in 2020</a>, becoming the <a href="https://www.iea.org/energy-system/renewables/solar-pv">cheapest source</a> of electricity in most parts of the world. While solar supply chains are still <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/solar-pv-global-supply-chains/executive-summary">concentrated in China</a>, manufacturing capacity for solar modules grew a whopping 190 percent in the US last year, according to a <a href="https://seia.org/research-resources/us-solar-market-insight/">separate report</a> released this week by the Solar Energy Industries Association and Wood Mackenzie. Texas saw the most growth in solar, according to both reports, and also has the most module manufacturing capacity — not bad for a state that’s historically been a hub for the oil and gas industry.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wind generation grew more modestly, but it is still about twice as big a source of electricity than solar, making up about 10 percent of the US electricity mix. Like solar, onshore wind is also generally a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-30/new-us-solar-and-wind-cost-less-than-keeping-coal-power-running">cheaper source</a> of electricity than coal or gas.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All these trends could help insulate renewable energy companies from the Trump administration’s assault on anything to do with addressing the climate crisis. Federal agencies have attempted to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/612212/clean-energy-funding-gold-epa-lee-zeldin-trump">claw back funding</a> for renewable energy projects. Trump, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/climate/oil-gas-donations-trump.html">accepted</a> tens of millions of dollars in campaign contributions from oil and gas companies, never misses an opportunity to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/03/trump-war-on-clean-energy-big-oil">trash talk</a> solar and wind projects. He frequently spouts misinformation that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/11/23718523/whale-beachings-east-coast-offshore-wind-shipping">falsely links whale deaths</a> to offshore wind projects and signed an executive order to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/climate/wind-power-executive-order-trump.html">stop federal approvals</a> and leases for wind farms on federal lands and waters. And his <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-tariffs-potential-clean-energy-effects-explained/">tariff threats</a> on goods from Canada and China could raise costs for new energy projects. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, electricity demand is climbing in the US after flatlining for 14 years with gains in energy efficiency. Electricity demand rose 3 percent last year, the fifth-highest jump this century, according to Ember. The rise of energy-hungry AI data centers, crypto mines, and electric vehicles and appliances has led to growing interest in developing more sources of energy across the board, from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/10/24317888/googles-data-center-solar-wind-renewable-energy-intersect-partnership">renewables</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/5/24261405/google-microsoft-amazon-tech-data-center-nuclear-energy">nuclear reactors</a> and <a href="https://ieefa.org/articles/data-centers-drive-buildout-gas-power-plants-and-pipelines-southeast">gas plants</a>. </p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-12-at-3.25.46%E2%80%AFPM.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.811675707436,100,78.376648585128" alt="A graph shows US wind and solar power generating more electricity than coal for the first time in 2024." title="A graph shows US wind and solar power generating more electricity than coal for the first time in 2024." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Electricity generation by source in the US between 2000 and 2024. | Image: Ember" data-portal-copyright="Image: Ember" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Rising demand led to a 3.3 percent increase in electricity generated from gas-fired power plants last year. Coal generation peaked in 2007, outcompeted by a boom in fracked gas. And while gas produces less planet-heating carbon dioxide emissions than coal, it’s still a powerful source of the pollution that leads to climate change.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A third <a href="https://cleanpower.org/wp-content/uploads/gateway/2025/03/US_National_Power_Demand_Study_2025_ExecSummary.pdf">report</a> on national power demand out this week —&nbsp;commissioned by a diverse range of trade groups including the American Clean Power Association, the American Petroleum Institute, and the Nuclear Energy Institute — says the nation&#8217;s power grids need to grow significantly. The US will need to install 900 gigawatts of renewable energy and batteries by 2040, it says. The report also advocates for up to 100 gigawatts of new gas capacity, even though that <a href="https://www.iisd.org/articles/press-release/no-new-fossil-fuel-projects-needed-transition-net-zero">doesn’t jive</a> with what researchers have found is necessary to prevent the climate crisis from getting much worse than it already is.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Solar is winning,” Ember chief analyst Dave Jones said in a press release. “It added more generation than gas in 2024 and batteries will ensure that solar can grow more cheaply and quickly than gas.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s plenty of room for growth, of course, considering around <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&amp;t=3">60 percent</a> of the nation’s electricity mix comes from fossil fuels. But renewables have come a long way since 2018, when coal still generated three times as much electricity as solar and wind combined, according to Ember.</p>

<p>The state of electric vehicle charging in North America is shaping up like the smartphone charging wars &mdash; but focused on much more expensive hardware. Right now, like USB-C and Android phones, the Combined Charging System (CCS, Type 1) plug is on a greater variety of cars. Meanwhile, Tesla&rsquo;s plug was long compared to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23312359/apple-iphone-lightning-cable-anniversary-10-years">Apple and Lightning</a>.</p>

<p>But while Apple eventually <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/26/23423977/iphone-usb-c-eu-law-joswiak-confirms-compliance-lightning">adopted USB-C</a>, Tesla is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/11/23453587/tesla-connector-north-american-standard-ccs-combo">opening up</a> its connector, renaming it the North American Charging Standard (NACS), and trying to shove CCS out of the way.</p>

<p>And <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/9/23755184/tesla-ev-charging-standard-nacs-ccs-gm-ford">it&rsquo;s working</a>: the new NACS port is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/27/23775208/tesla-nacs-electric-car-charging-standard-sae-chargepoint">being standardized</a> by SAE International, and today, largely every automaker, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/27/23738771/ford-tesla-electric-car-charging-nacs">Ford</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/8/23754470/gm-tesla-ev-supercharger-nacs-elon-musk">GM</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/19/23924413/toyota-lexus-tesla-nacs-supercharger-electric-vehicle-charging-2025">Toyota</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/20/23766979/rivian-tesla-ev-charging-standard-nacs-r1t-r1s">Rivian</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/27/23775579/volvo-tesla-electric-car-supercharger-nacs">Volvo</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/29/23778527/now-polestar-is-plugging-into-teslas-superchargers-too">Polestar</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/19/23800436/nissan-tesla-nacs-support-supercharging-adapter">Nissan</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/7/23787186/mercedes-benz-tesla-nacs-ev-charging-standard">Mercedes-Benz</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23884083/jaguar-cuts-a-tesla-supercharging-deal-too">Jaguar Land Rover</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/15/23832744/fisker-tesla-nacs-connector-standard-supercharger-adapter">Fisker</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/5/23904089/hyundai-tesla-nacs-ev-charging-plug">Hyundai</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/12/24070654/stellantis-tesla-ev-charging-plus-nacs-adapter">Stellantis</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/19/24008426/volkswagen-audi-porsche-tesla-nacs-ev-charging-plug">Volkswagen</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/17/23921374/bmw-mini-rolls-royce-tesla-nacs-ev-charging-standard">BMW</a>, has signed on. New cars equipped with NACS are on the way but likely won&rsquo;t start rolling out until 2026.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Europe already dealt with its standards issue by settling on CCS2. For now, EV drivers in their Tesla Model Ys, Kia EV6s, and Nissan Leafs (with the ailing CHAdeMO connector) in the US are still stuck looking for the right station or adapter and hoping <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/17/23308612/ev-charging-broken-unreliable-survey-jd-power">everything&rsquo;s operational</a> &mdash; but things should get easier soon.</p>

<p>To help solve these issues, the federal government has established <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/10/22926969/electric-vehicle-ev-charging-network-biden-plan">a pool</a> of $7.5 billion to fund charging network operators in building reliable EV infrastructure.</p>

<p>North America can become a great and convenient place to own an electric vehicle, but how long will that take? You can find out by reading all the news about electric vehicle charging right here, so come back and plug in often.</p>
